10,,,,kind

12,,,,"artificial,"
13,,,,doesn't
14,,,,carry
15,,,,over
16,,,,to
17,,,,interpreted
18,,,,languages:
19,,,,what
20,,,,about
21,,,,a
22,,,,Python/Perl/Ruby
23,,,,"plugin,"
24,,,,which
25,,,,gets
26,,,,loaded
27,,,,via
28,import or,,,
29,,,,execfile?
30,,,,I'm
31,,,,not
32,,,,sure
33,,,,that
34,,,,the
35,,,,distinction
36,,,,is
37,,,,artificial.
38,,,,After
39,,,,a
40,,,,dynamic
41,,,,load
42,,,,the
43,,,,plugin
44,,,,code
45,,,,shares
46,,,,an
47,,,,execution
48,,,,context
49,,,,with
50,,,,the
51,,,,GPLed
52,,,,code.
53,,,,After
54,,,,a
55,,,,fork/exec
56,,,,it
57,,,,does
58,,,,not.
59,,,,In
60,,,,anycase
61,,,,I
62,,,,would
63,,,,guess
64,,,,that
65,,,,importing
66,,,,causes
67,,,,the
68,,,,new
69,,,,code
70,,,,to
71,,,,run
72,,,,in
73,,,,the
74,,,,same
75,,,,execution
76,,,,context
77,,,,as
78,,,,the
79,,,,GPLed
80,,,,"bit,"
81,,,,and
82,,,,you
83,,,,should
84,,,,treat
85,,,,it
86,,,,like
87,,,,the
88,,,,dynamic
89,,,,link
90,,,,case.
91,,,,No?
