In your first attempt, np.array is just doing its job.  It sees a nested collection of data that can be converted to a 3-D array, so it does so.
To get a 2-D array of objects, you can change this:
to this:
Here's a concrete example:
I don't have your Vector class, so I'll just use numpy arrays as the objects that I want in the array of objects.
Here's the data that I want to put into an array of objects. It is a nested list of numpy arrays, each with two elements:
