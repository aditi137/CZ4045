That doesn't make much sense to me at all since it should always be getting defined before being referenced? I can't find the problem anyway. I'm sure a lot of my code could be improved as well as I am very new to classes etc. 
If you have any tips on how to open the QDialog each time that is better than what I'm currently trying or other helpful tips, please don't hesitate to mention that as well. (Try to ignore the crappy naming convention, I will fix that in the future.)"
