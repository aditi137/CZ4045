3,,,,"this,"
4,,,,that
5,,,,I
6,,,,hope
7,,,,can
8,,,,be
9,,,,"bettered,"
10,,,,is
11,,,,to
12,,,,use
13,,,,Oracle
14,,,,to
15,,,,explicitly
16,,,,convert

22,,,,This
23,,,,"works,"
24,,,,but
25,,,,isn't

27,,,,I'd
28,,,,like
29,,,,to
30,,,,use
31,,,,the
32,,,,same
33,,,,Python
34,,,,script
35,,,,against
36,,,,a
