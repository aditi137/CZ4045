71,"EDIT:
You need to define the self-contained module that is least dependent on the MainWindow - it can be spectra process only, or spectra process with tab. You can pass info to process either on construction, or through standard input, and retrieve data from process through standard output. Key idea when selecting lawyer to put process in is to minimize communication and dependency between the process and MainWindow. You may think of a process as simple C program:
int main(int argc,char* argv[])"
