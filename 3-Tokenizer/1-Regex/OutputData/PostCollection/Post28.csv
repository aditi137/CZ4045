1,,,,what
2,,,,you
3,,,,need
4,,,,is
5,,,,classobj
6,,,,from
7,,,,new
8,,,,module.
9,,,,That
10,,,,would
11,,,,allow
12,,,,you
13,,,,to
14,,,,construct
15,,,,exception
16,,,,classes
17,,,,dynamically
18,,,,(classobj
19,,,,takes
20,,,,a
21,,,,string
22,,,,as
23,,,,an
24,,,,argument
25,,,,for
26,,,,the
27,,,,class
28,,,,name).
29,,,,this
30,,,,gives
31,,,,you:
32,,,,remember
33,,,,that
34,,,,you
35,,,,can
36,,,,always
37,,,,get
38,,,,the
39,,,,class

41,,,,through:
42,,,,"So,"
43,,,,after

49,,,,you
50,,,,should
51,,,,be
52,,,,able
53,,,,to
54,,,,obtain
55,,,,appropriate
56,,,,exception
57,,,,class

59,,,,and
60,,,,construct
61,,,,a
62,,,,class
63,,,,object
64,,,,using
65,,,,that

67,,,,and
68,,,,then
69,,,,raise

72,,,,P.S.
73,,,,-
74,,,,you
75,,,,can
76,,,,also
77,,,,raise

80,,,,this
