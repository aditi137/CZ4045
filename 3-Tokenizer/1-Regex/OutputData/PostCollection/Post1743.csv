JSON Save Game Example
This is basically the important part that would give you some hint on the client side. Do not get lost at saving into a file. It is basically writing the raw bytes to the file, which you would replace by sending over the network:
... and then you would do something like this on the server side, again instead of reading from file, you would read from the network, but that is not a biggie as both are IO.
You could use raw protocol to design your own, or just use an extending. I would suggest to go with something standard, like http (tcp/udp)"
