66,Is
67,there
68,anyway
69,for
70,me
71,to
72,put
73,a
74,middleware
75,that
76,run
77,before
78,all

85,Such
86,as
87,"X: it will add header for each request to set the user id and some user's information if the user has logged in.
I.E: after I can implement my above idea. Each request will run through 1 in below 3 cases:
X, A
X, B
X, C
What do you say?
Thanks
Update 1: more information
The middleware, I mean the request middle ware.
If X is a middleware then it will be run before the request is passed to the app (or module)"
88,","
89,it
90,will
91,change
92,the
93,request
94,only
95,such
96,"as:
Do some authentication actions  
Add some headers:
X-User-Id: for authorized user id
X-User-Scopes: for scopes of authorized user
etc ...
And of course, it is independent to the inside module's language (PHP or Python or Java or ...)"
97,The
98,X
99,middleware
100,should
101,be
