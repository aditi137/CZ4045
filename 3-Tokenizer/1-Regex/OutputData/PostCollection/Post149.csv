Any other ideas or recommendations to do this? 
One thing that's somewhat annoying is the blinking cursor in the terminal on the first digit of the percentage. Is there a way to prevent this? Is there a way to hide the cursor?
EDIT:
Here a better alternative using a global variable for the filename in dlProgress and the '\r' code:
    global rem_file # global variable to be used in dlProgress
    urllib.urlretrieve(rem_file, loc_file, reporthook=dlProgress)"
