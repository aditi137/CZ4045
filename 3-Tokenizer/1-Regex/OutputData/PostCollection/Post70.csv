11,,,,each
12,,,,thread
13,,,,will

28,,,,As
29,,,,you
30,,,,have
31,,,,hinted
32,,,,at
33,,,,Python
34,,,,threads
35,,,,are
36,,,,implemented
37,,,,through
38,,,,time-slicing.
39,,,,This
40,,,,is
41,,,,how
42,,,,they
43,,,,get
44,,,,the

47,,,,In
48,,,,my
49,,,,example
50,,,,my
51,,,,Foo
52,,,,class
53,,,,extends
54,,,,"thread,"
55,,,,I
56,,,,then
57,,,,implement
58,,,,the

62,,,,is
63,,,,where
64,,,,the

74,,,,thread
75,,,,goes.
76,,,,To
77,,,,start
78,,,,the
79,,,,thread
80,,,,you
81,,,,call
82,,,,start()
83,,,,on
84,,,,the

86,,,,"object,"
87,,,,which
88,,,,will
89,,,,automatically
90,,,,invoke

96,,,,this
97,,,,is
98,,,,just
99,,,,the

104,,,,eventually
105,,,,want

107,,,,learn
108,,,,about

111,,,,and
