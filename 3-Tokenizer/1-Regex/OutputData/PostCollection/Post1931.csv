From itertools recipes:
Upper and Lowercase Letters
You can manually implement the latter recipe, or install a library that implements it for you, e.g. pip install more_itertools:
Here partition uses a predicate function to determine if each item in an iterable is lowercase.  If not, it is filtered into the false group.  Otherwise, it is filtered into the group of true items.  We iterate to expose these groups.
Even and Odd Indices
You can modify this to work for odd and even indices as well:
Here we zip an itertools.count()"
16,object
17,to
18,enumerate
19,the
20,iterable
21,.
22,Then
23,we
24,iterate
25,the
26,children
27,so
28,that
29,the
