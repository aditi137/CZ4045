There are comments in the source code. Anyway, the main steps are:
The expression variables are found as single-character uppercase names.
Each variable can be either True or False. We find all combinations.
We select only such combinations that make the whole expression True.
We keep only minimal solutions, i.e. those that are not supersets of other solutions.
