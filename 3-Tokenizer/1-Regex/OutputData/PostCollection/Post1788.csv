I can't get rid of looping over my dictionary to retrieve them.
Reread your code! You're not looping over the dictionary, you're iterating over the sub_list! Maybe this is a syntax problem, here's how you could rewrite that iteration:
And think about it, what you want is to get the precalculated radius value for each element of the sublist. So there's actually no other way than iterating over the sublist! Whether you do it using a list comprehension or a map is mostly a matter of personal preference, even though the list comprehension is more efficient:
If you talk about complexity, consider the size of d being m, and the one of values being n, then:
