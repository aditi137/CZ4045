So here is my defaultdict data: 
so my current json_data looks like this: 
So in my understanding the numbers would be the corresponding ""name"":""5"" and then my JSON format file would also have the children as ""children"". As what it is right now, my JSON format output doesn't run in the HTML code of the dendogram. 
Any help on how to output my defaultdict into the appropriate JSON format that would work with the HTML code for producing that dendogram would be great. The code has to be Python. 
The expected outcome would be like this:

The answer of martineau works, but it's not exactly what I want. I start with a defaultdict(list)"
