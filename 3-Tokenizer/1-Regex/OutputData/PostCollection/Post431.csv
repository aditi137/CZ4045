The most popular way of indenting Python is with spaces only.
What other underlying reason do you need?
To put it less bluntly: Consider also the scope of the PEP as stated in the very first paragraph:
This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution.
The intention is to make all code that goes in the official python distribution consistently formatted (I hope we can agree that this is universally a Good Thingâ„¢)"

Guido was the one to choose. He didn't even have to give a reason, but he still did by referring to empirical data.
For all other purposes you can either take this PEP as a recommendation, or you can ignore it -- your choice, or your team's, or your team leaders.
