On my system, the ipython locate gave me c:\users\osmith\.ipython, not the _ipython you'll see mentioned in the YouTube videos done with Windows XP,
Look in the directory ipython locate specifies for a profile directory; if you aren't actively doing anything with ipython profiles, it should be .ipython\profile_default, if you are using profiles, then I leave it to you to s/profile_default/${YOUR_PROFILE_NAME}/g
Check the profile_default directory for a ipython_config.py file, if it's not there, tell IPython to initialize itself: ipython profile create
Open the config file in a text editor,
If you are the kind of person who hasn't messed around with their console overly much and installs things in standard places, you can skip straight to this step by typing: ipython profile create followed by start notepad .ipython\profile_default\ipython_config.py.
Search for the string c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor,
The comment above this indicates you can also use the EDITOR environment variable, but hard coding file paths never hurt anyone so lets do eet:
Copy the line and remove the leading hash and spaces from the copy.
