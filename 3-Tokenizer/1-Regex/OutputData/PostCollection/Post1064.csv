It looks like Ipython notebook was using the configuration from C:\pythonPath\winpythonPath\settings\.ipython\profile_default
Even though ipython locate returns C:\users\Username\.ipython
As a result, modifying the ipython_notebook_config.py file did nothing to change my working directory.
Additionally ipython profile_create was not creating the needed python files in C:\pythonPath\winpythonPath\settings\.ipython\profile_default
I'm sure there's a better way, but to resolve this quickly, I copied the edited python files from C:\users\Username\.ipython\profile_default to C:\pythonPath\winpythonPath\settings\.ipython\profile_default
