17,even

19,your

27,On
28,my
29,end
30,I
31,tried
32,opening
33,a

52,So
53,you
54,can
55,do
56,"this: Open your image with mspaint, then go to File > Save As and from the ""Save As Type"" dropdown, choose GIF. Then the code should work. This is what I used:
(btw, if I changed line 7 above to photo = PhotoImage(imgPath)"
57,then
58,like
59,you
60,","
61,no
62,image
