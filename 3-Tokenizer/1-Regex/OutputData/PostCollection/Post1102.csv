nSql result is always same 3 columns.
Below query runs and puts data into the table TBL2. If there is already data in TBL2 for that day, I want the query to replace the data with new data.
If there is not data in TBL2, I want to put data in normal way.
For example, if I run the query in the morning and if I want to run it again in evening, I want new data to replace old data for that day, since data will be inserted into TBL2 everyday. 
It is also precaution that if the data already exists (if run by coworker)"
