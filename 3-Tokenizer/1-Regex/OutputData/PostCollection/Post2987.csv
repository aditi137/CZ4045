the Python Shell by simply typing python or python[version-number]

96,the

100,on
101,my
102,"mac:
As you might can tell from the text above, a newline in the Python Shell is denoted by three caret symbols: >>>. Each newline, a new three carets are printed. When using Python Shell, there are a few differences, then just typing a script up, but the main one is that it execute your code line by line.
In the Python Shell you can only type one line of code at a time. Here is an example to illustrate my point further:
As you can tell from the above program, indention is noted by three dots: ..., and the only time the Python Shell shows more then one line at a time, is when it is 'echoing' back what you typed in.
Why is it called interactive?
One of the main reason its called interactive is that to display variable values or run the module in general, you don't have to explicitly invoke the python interpreter. Take the example below:
As displayed above, I was able to print the value of name and run the function func()"
103,without
104,having
105,to
106,use
107,a
108,print
109,command

111,explicitly
