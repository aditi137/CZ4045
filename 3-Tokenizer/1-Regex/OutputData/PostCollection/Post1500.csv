The program is probably stuck in the while True: cycle infinitely, as you only break out of the cycle when number <= 0. I haven't read your code with too much attention, but do you intend to break out of the while True: loop with the break statements that are inside the while div*div<=number: cycle? That is not possible. You would most probably need to have a variable to detect if you exit your loop prematurely and then break from the outer loop. Otherwise, maybe the else clause of python loops may help somehow (see Control Flow in Python)"
