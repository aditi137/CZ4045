Welcome to yet another set of Python 3.x timings, extrapolated from wr.'s excellent Python 2.x-specific response. Unlike AChampion's equally helpful Python 3.x-specific response, the timings below also time outlier solutions suggested above â€“ including:

Unsurprisingly, manual iteration remains at least twice as fast as the next fastest solution. Although the gap has decreased from the Bad Old Python 2.x days (in which manual iteration was at least four times as fast)"
