6,"Tensorflow: How to get a tensor by name?
I can give names to operations. But actually they named differently.
For example:
tf.get_variable creates variable with exactly the same name as I ask. Operations add prefixes to scope. 
I want to name my operation so that I can get it. In my case I want to get b with tf.get_variable('b')"
