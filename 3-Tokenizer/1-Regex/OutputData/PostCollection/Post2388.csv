There's a bug report here, but long story short is that pyenv uses shims to intercept package imports and route them correctly.
This means that pyenv has to muddle with the path. When I run python directly, the shims are apparent in the python path:
However, in the dynamically imported package, the same code results in an output of:
So, the issue appears to be that pyenv isn't doing its shim magic during dynamic imports.
To solve the problem, I used pip install --user to force pip to install to the place where the dynamic import is looking, rather than where pyenv wants the install to go. (also add a -I if you've previously installed the package to force a reinstall)"
