10,"sklearn: I want to get a list of three models, where all parameters are fixed except for C corresponding to the 1, 10, and 100 in each model. I have the following two functions. 
I then build a model and specify a dictionary of parameters. 
And generate the models using the functions I just defined. 
However, the outcome is the same model (using the last parameter, i.e. 100)"
