0,,,,Why
1,,,,not
2,,,,throw
3,,,,an
4,,,,exception
5,,,,if
6,,,,the
7,,,,operation
8,,,,wasn't
9,,,,successful?
10,,,,"Personally,"
11,,,,I
12,,,,tend
13,,,,to
14,,,,be
15,,,,of
16,,,,the
17,,,,opinion
18,,,,that
19,,,,if
20,,,,you
21,,,,need
22,,,,to
23,,,,return
24,,,,more
25,,,,than
26,,,,one
27,,,,value
28,,,,from
29,,,,a
30,,,,"function,"
31,,,,you
32,,,,should
33,,,,reconsider
34,,,,if
35,,,,you're
36,,,,doing
37,,,,things
38,,,,the
39,,,,right
40,,,,way
41,,,,or
42,,,,use
43,,,,an
44,,,,object.
45,,,,But
46,,,,more
47,,,,directly
48,,,,to
49,,,,the
50,,,,"point,"
51,,,,if
52,,,,you
53,,,,throw
54,,,,an
55,,,,"exception,"
56,,,,you're
57,,,,forcing
58,,,,them
59,,,,to
60,,,,deal
61,,,,with
62,,,,the
63,,,,problem.
64,,,,If
65,,,,you
66,,,,try
67,,,,to
68,,,,return
69,,,,a
70,,,,value
71,,,,that
72,,,,indicates
73,,,,"failure,"
74,,,,it's
75,,,,very
76,,,,well
77,,,,possible
78,,,,somebody
79,,,,could
80,,,,not
81,,,,check
82,,,,the
83,,,,value
84,,,,and
85,,,,end
86,,,,up
87,,,,with
88,,,,some
89,,,,potentially
90,,,,hard
91,,,,to
