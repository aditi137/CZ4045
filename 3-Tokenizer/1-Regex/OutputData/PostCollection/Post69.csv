0,,,,Python's
1,,,,a
2,,,,fairly
3,,,,easy
4,,,,language
5,,,,to
6,,,,thread
7,,,,"in,"
8,,,,but
9,,,,there
10,,,,are
11,,,,caveats.
12,,,,The
13,,,,biggest
14,,,,thing
15,,,,you
16,,,,need
17,,,,to
18,,,,know
19,,,,about
20,,,,is
21,,,,the
22,,,,Global
23,,,,Interpreter
24,,,,Lock.
25,,,,This
26,,,,allows
27,,,,only
28,,,,one
29,,,,thread
30,,,,to
31,,,,access
32,,,,the
33,,,,interpreter.
34,,,,This
35,,,,means
36,,,,two
37,,,,things:
38,,,,1)
39,,,,you
40,,,,rarely
41,,,,ever
42,,,,find
43,,,,yourself
44,,,,using
45,,,,a
46,,,,lock
47,,,,statement
48,,,,in
49,,,,python
50,,,,and
51,,,,2)
52,,,,if
53,,,,you
54,,,,want
55,,,,to
56,,,,take
57,,,,advantage
58,,,,of
59,,,,multi-processor
60,,,,"systems,"
61,,,,you
62,,,,have
63,,,,to
64,,,,use
65,,,,separate
66,,,,processes.
67,,,,EDIT:
68,,,,I
69,,,,should
70,,,,also
71,,,,point
72,,,,out
73,,,,that
74,,,,you
75,,,,can
76,,,,put
77,,,,some
78,,,,of
79,,,,the
80,,,,code
81,,,,in
82,,,,C/C++
83,,,,if
84,,,,you
85,,,,want
86,,,,to
87,,,,get
88,,,,around
89,,,,the
90,,,,GIL
91,,,,as
92,,,,well.
93,,,,"Thus,"
94,,,,you
95,,,,need
96,,,,to
97,,,,re-consider
98,,,,why
99,,,,you
100,,,,want
101,,,,to
102,,,,use
103,,,,threads.
104,,,,If
105,,,,you
106,,,,want
107,,,,to
108,,,,parallelize
109,,,,your
110,,,,app
111,,,,to
112,,,,take
113,,,,advantage
114,,,,of
115,,,,dual-core
116,,,,"architecture,"
117,,,,you
118,,,,need
119,,,,to
120,,,,consider
121,,,,breaking
122,,,,your
123,,,,app
124,,,,up
125,,,,into
126,,,,multiple
127,,,,processes.
128,,,,If
129,,,,you
130,,,,want
131,,,,to
132,,,,improve
133,,,,"responsiveness,"
134,,,,you
135,,,,should
136,,,,CONSIDER
137,,,,using
138,,,,threads.
139,,,,There
140,,,,are
141,,,,other
142,,,,alternatives
143,,,,"though,"
144,,,,namely
145,,,,microthreading.
146,,,,There
147,,,,are
148,,,,also
149,,,,some
150,,,,frameworks
151,,,,that
152,,,,you
153,,,,should
154,,,,look
155,,,,into:
156,,,,stackless
157,,,,python
158,,,,greenlets
159,,,,gevent
160,,,,monocle
