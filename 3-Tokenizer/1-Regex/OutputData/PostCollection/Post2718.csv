This solution won't work with some software like IDLE, Sublime Text, Eclipse... The problem with running it within this type of software is that clear/cls uses ANSI escape sequences to clear the screen. These commands write a string such as ""\033[[80;j"" to the output buffer. The native command prompt is able to interpret this as a command to clear the screen but these pseudo-terminals don't know how to interpret it, so they just end up printing small square as if printing an unknown character.
If you're using this type of software, one hack around could be doing print('\n' * 100)"
