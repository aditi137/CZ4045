Can you translate my LINQ to Ruby? Python? Any other functional programming language?
Note: Please try not to use too many loops and conditionals - otherwise the solution is trivial. Also, I'd rather see a solution where you don't have to generate an array much bigger than N so you can then just remove the duplicates and trim it down to N.
I know I'm being picky, but I'd really like to see some elegant solutions to this problem.
Thanks!

I've been told this post came across as rather snobbish. I wasn't trying to imply that LINQ is better than Ruby/Python; or that my solution is much better than everyone else's. My intent is just to learn how to do this (with certain constraints)"
