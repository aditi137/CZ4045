24,the

26,"here: http://thumbnail.sorl.net/template.html#thumbnail
and have tried various ways of implimenting to no avail. I get errors similar to:
'thumbnail' tag received a bad argument: 'format'
My code works fine without the "" format=""png"" "" part, it just makes a jpg thumbnail. However, I want a png thumbnail.
{% thumbnail product.main_image.picture 84x84 format=""png"" as image %}
Also, adding THUMBNAIL_FORMAT = ""PNG""
to my settings.py did nothing
Thanks,
