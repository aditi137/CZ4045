18,a
19,particular
20,task

22,Windows
23,needs
24,to
25,know
26,at
27,the
28,start
29,of
30,the
31,program

57,There
58,are
59,two
60,ways
61,to
62,do
63,"this:
Write a manifest file that tells Windows the application might require some privileges
Run the application with elevated privileges from inside another program
This two articles explain in much more detail how this works.
What I'd do, if you don't want to write a nasty ctypes wrapper for the CreateElevatedProcess API, is use the ShellExecuteEx trick explained in the Code Project article (Pywin32 comes with a wrapper for ShellExecute)"

67,Something

118,I
