area ID
area name
URL of a KML file with the area boundaries: http://link.to/area_ID.kml
How can I load in the KML to a column in the CSV in order to upload it to Fusion Tables?
I'm working in Python. The KML is also available as JSON if that helps. 
I know that I need to add it as a geometry column in the Fusion Table: I just literally don't understand how to get it into the CSV file so that I can then upload it to Fusion Tables. 
Thanks for your help. 
UPDATE: I've tried to write the KML as a string to the column in the CSV (<Polygon>....</Polygon>)"
