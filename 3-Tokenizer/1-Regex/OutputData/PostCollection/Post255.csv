And people don't learn Python because
  it will get them a job; they learn it
  because they genuinely like to program
  and aren't satisfied with the
  languages they already know.
Which makes them exactly the kind of
  programmers companies should want to
  hire. Hence what, for lack of a better
  name, I'll call the Python paradox: if
  a company chooses to write its
  software in a comparatively esoteric
  language, they'll be able to hire
  better programmers, because they'll
  attract only those who cared enough to
  learn it. And for programmers the
  paradox is even more pronounced: the
  language to learn, if you want to get
  a good job, is a language that people
  don't learn merely to get a job.
If an employer was willing to pay for the cost of learning a new language, chances are the people who volunteered to learn (assuming it wasn't a mandatory class)"
