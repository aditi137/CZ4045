Which works fine. But while decrypting, it doesn't seem to work. I'm still getting characters that are outside of the ASCII character set. E.g:
Here is the code I've written:
If the subtracted offset results in a number less than 32, we're supposed to add 94 to the result. I thought that is exactly what I've done here, but I must be going wrong somewhere. 
It's also not decrypting strings properly. I can encrypt strings, but when I try to decrypt the string I just encrypted, it returns the wrong result.
Any help would be greatly appreciated :)"
