I would like to create a 3D binary image, b,  with 101 pixels in each of the x,y,z dimensions, of coordinates ranging between 0.00 and 1.00. 
Pixels at locations defined by a should take on a value of 1, all other pixels should have a value of 0.
I can create an array of zeros of the right shape with b = np.zeros((101,101,101)"
