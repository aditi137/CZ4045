    auth-9|duration:154.92
and 133.92 is bigger than 132.72, but less than 144.59 or 154.92
I'm sorry if Its unclear explained, but I tried my best.
EDIT:
I'm trying it again:
I need a function which returns the ""predicted/rank"" for a custom duration from the sorted list/sorted by ""duration/DESC"".
So a duration of 160 would return the last place, which is 4. (index+1)"
