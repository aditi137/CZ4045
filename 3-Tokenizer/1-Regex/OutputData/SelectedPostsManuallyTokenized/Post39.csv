Following
are
the
most
commonly
used
calls
for
downloading
files
in
python
:
"urllib.urlretrieve('url_to_file',file_name)"
urllib2.urlopen('url_to_file')
requests.get(url)
"wget.download('url',file_name)"
Note
:
urlopen
and
urlretrieve
are
found
to
perform
relatively
bad
with
downloading
large
files
(
size
>
500
MB
)
.
requests.get
stores
the
file
in-memory
until
download
is
complete
.
