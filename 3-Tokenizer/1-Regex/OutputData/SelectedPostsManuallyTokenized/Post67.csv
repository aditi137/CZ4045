PyPy
translator
is
in
general
","
not
intended
for
more
public
use
.
We
use
it
for
translating
our
own
python
interpreter
(
including
JIT
and
GCs
","
both
written
in
RPython
","
this
restricted
subset
of
Python
)
.
The
idea
is
that
with
good
JIT
and
GC
","
you'll
be
able
to
speedups
even
without
knowing
or
using
PyPy's
translation
toolchain
(
and
more
importantly
","
without
restricting
yourself
to
RPython
)
.
Cheers
