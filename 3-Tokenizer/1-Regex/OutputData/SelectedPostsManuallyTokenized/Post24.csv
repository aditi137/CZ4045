From
Wikipedia
on
UTF-8
:
UTF-8
(
8-bit
UCS
/
Unicode
Transformation
Format
)
is
a
variable-length
character
encoding
for
Unicode
.
It
is
able
to
represent
any
character
in
the
Unicode
standard
","
yet
the
initial
encoding
of
byte
codes
and
character
assignments
for
UTF-8
is
backwards
compatible
with
ASCII
.
For
these
reasons
","
it
is
steadily
becoming
the
preferred
encoding
for
e-mail
","
web
pages
[1]
","
and
other
places
where
characters
are
stored
or
streamed
.
So
","
it's
anywhere
between
one
and
four
bytes
depending
on
which
character
you
wish
to
represent
within
the
realm
of
Unicode
.
From
Wikipedia
on
Unicode
:
In
computing
","
Unicode
is
an
industry
standard
allowing
computers
to
consistently
represent
and
manipulate
text
expressed
in
most
of
the
world's
writing
systems
.
So
it's
able
to
represent
most
(
but
not
all
)
of
the
world's
writing
systems
.
I
hope
this
helps
:)
