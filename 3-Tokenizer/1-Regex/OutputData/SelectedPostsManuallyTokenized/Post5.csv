Reference
counting
is
particularly
difficult
to
do
efficiently
in
a
multi-threaded
environment
.
I
don't
know
how
you'd
even
start
to
do
it
without
getting
into
hardware
assisted
transactions
or
similar
(
currently
)
unusual
atomic
instructions
.
Reference
counting
is
easy
to
implement
.
JVMs
have
had
a
lot
of
money
sunk
into
competing
implementations
","
so
it
shouldn't
be
surprising
that
they
implement
very
good
solutions
to
very
difficult
problems
.
However
","
it's
becoming
increasingly
easy
to
target
your
favourite
language
at
the
JVM
.
