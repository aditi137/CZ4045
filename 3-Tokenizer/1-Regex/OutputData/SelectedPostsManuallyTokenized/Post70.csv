It
looks
like
something
absolutely
revolutionary
from
simply
reading
the
description
","
As
far
as
I
know
","
PyPy
is
novel
in
the
sense
that
it
is
the
first
system
expressly
designed
for
implementing
languages
.
Other
tools
exist
to
help
with
much
of
the
very
front
end
","
such
as
parser
generators
","
or
for
the
very
back
end
","
such
as
code
generation
","
but
not
much
existed
for
connecting
the
two
.
