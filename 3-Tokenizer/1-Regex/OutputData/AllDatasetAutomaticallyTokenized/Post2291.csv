In
Python
3
","
input
returns
a
string
(
this
is
different
in
Python
2.x
","
which
may
be
part
of
the
confusion
)
.
That
means
that
length
=
len
+
len
is
actually
performing
string
concatenation
","
ie
.
'
2
'
+
'
2
'
=
'
22
'
.
Using
either
"int(input(""..."")"
)
or
"float(input(""..."")"
)
will
turn
them
into
numbers
.
(
note
that
both
functions
will
create
errors
if
the
user
puts
in
strings
that
can't
be
converted
to
numbers
.
