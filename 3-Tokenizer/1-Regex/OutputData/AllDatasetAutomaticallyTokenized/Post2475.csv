I
want
to
force
a
line
break
after
every
10
numbers
or
9
nine
splits
on
a
txt
file
in
python
?
How
would
I
go
about
this
?
So
say
i
have
int
a
txt.file
and
output
should
be
so
essentially
break
after
every
10
numbers
","
or
9
line
splits
I
have
tried
:
But
this
doesn't
quite
solve
it
.
Also
note
that
the
line
lengths
can
vary
.
So
the
first
line
could
have
5
numbers
and
the
second
line
have
9
and
the
third
10
and
the
fourth
10
