Pickle
recreates
objects
by
looking
up
callables
(
commonly
classes
","
but
really
any
callable
)
and
calling
them
with
fixed
arguments
.
This
means
that
unpickling
may
run
any
callable
anywhere
","
with
any
arguments
.
Even
if
the
relevant
module
hasn't
been
imported
yet
","
pickle
will
gladly
import it
.
It
takes
only
a
couple
dozen
characters
to
execute
os.system
","
for
example
.
So
you're
screwed
before
you
even
get
an
object
back
.
