There
are
python-specific
gui-api
such
as
kivy
(
successor
or
pymt
)
","
pygui
(
based
on
pyrex
)
","
pyui
and
nufox
","
which
do
not
compare
with
the
more
robust
toolkits
like
wxpython
","
pyqt
","
pygtk
and
tkinter
.
They
are
just
extra
optional
tools
.
The
only
thing
unique
about
them
is
these
are
python-specific
api
","
just
like
there
are
prima
(
perl-specific
api
)
and
shoes
(
ruby-specific
api
)
.
It
helps
us
to
understand
that
when
tk
is
tcl-based
port
of
api
(
and
others
are
c
and
c
+
+
based
)
","
then
these
api
are
specifically
done
for
the
respective
three
scripting
languages
.
Out
of
these
","
kivy
is
the
most
robust
","
whereas
pygui's
coding
is
mentioned
to
be
very
python-like
","
pyui
is
least
robust
but
worth
trying
and
all
of
these
should
be
portable
wherever
python
or
python-based
application
goes
.
Then
there
is
jpype
which
is
a
toolkit
usable
with
jython
and
pydev
","
and
which
is
actually
java's
japi
customized
under
python
/
jython-interface
.
