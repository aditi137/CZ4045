I
am
trying
to
make
a
visualization
of
a
graph
using
Sage
.
I
need
to
make
the
visualization
exactly
as
I
am
writing
the
Python
code
.
I
have
downloaded
and
installed
the
Sage
for
Ubuntu
and
Sage
Notebook
is
working
perfectly
.
But
I
want
to
take
user
input
from
Tkinter
and
then
show
those
input
on
the
Graph
(
generated
by
Sage
)
.
However
","
I
am
unable
to
import sage
in
the
Python
Shell
.
How
can
I
do
so
?
