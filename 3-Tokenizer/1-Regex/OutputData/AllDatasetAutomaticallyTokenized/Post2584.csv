I'm
trying
to
run
a
Flask
app
with
Gunicorn
.
When
I
run
gunicorn
app:index
","
I
get
the
error
TypeError
:
index()
takes
0
positional
arguments
but
2
were
given
.
None
of
the
examples
I've
seen
show
index
needing
two
parameters
.
What
does
this
error
mean
?
How
do
I
run
Flask
with
Gunicorn
?
I
changed
index
to
take
two
arguments
","
but
got
a
different
error
.
