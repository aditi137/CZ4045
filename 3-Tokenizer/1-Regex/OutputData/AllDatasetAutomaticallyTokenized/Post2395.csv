What
is
the
most
efficient
way
to
find
the
intersection
of
2
lists
when
both
lists
contain
non-hashables
?
Basically
","
let's
say
I
have
the
following
lists
(
which
I
completely
made
up
)
:
We
can
see
that
the
first
element
of
A
is
the
same
as
the
first
element
of
B
.
I
can
do
the
simple
thing
by
creating
a
for
loop
:
but
I'm
just
wondering
if
there
is
a
more
efficient
","
cooler
","
or
simpler
way
.
For
example
","
there
is
:
...
but
obviously
I
can't
use
set
or
frozenset
for
non-hashables
because
I
get
Is
there
anything
like
this
for
non-hashables
?
