I
want
to
build
an
executable
to
distribute
to
people
without
python
installed
on
their
machines
.
Is
there
an
add-on
to
Eclipse
that
allows
this
?
I
couldn't
find
one
.
If
not
","
do
you
have
a
builder
that
you
recommend
that
would
make
it
easy
to
go
to
my
python
project
directory
created
in
Eclipse
","
and
bundle
it
all
up
?
Thanks
","
Mark
