I
have
labeled
an
binary
image
However
when
I
check
the
number
of
labels
","
I
get
535
elements
.
As
a
solution
for
this
I
thought
about
using
measure.regionprops
in
order
to
remove
the
labels
with
a
small
pixel
area
.
How
would
you
guys
approach
this
?
I
have
tried
the
following
","
but
for
one
reason
or
another
the
new
array
is
no
longer
seen
as
a
correct
label
element
.
