along
with
the
score
for
each
student
in
JSON
format
.
I
already
ran
a
query
on
the
datastore
and
was
able
to
retrieve
information
regarding
each
student
using
But
have
no
clue
how
to
get
ALL
of
the
students.I
have
read
examples
given
by
Google

but
am
still
lost.I
know

time
around
i'll
need
a

about
all

can
come
up
with.Any
