i
'
ve
been
struggling
for
days
on
this
thing....but
to
no
avail
.
I'm
not
very
good
at
difficult
math
let
alone
this
kind
of
level
of
difficulty
.
I
was
trying
to
implement
the
maximum
entropy
application
for
the
lottery
in
python
for
my
graduation
assignment
","
altough
the
focus
of
the
project
was
to
implement
a
number
of
data
mining
techinques
(
Decision
trees
","
Apriori
","
kmeans
)
something
alreadey
finished
","
i
just
could
not
pass
the
opportunity
to
do
something
more
advanced....but
i
guess
this
is
too
advanced
for
me
.
So
","
my
question
is
how
can
i
solve
the
non
linear
equation
(
8
)
from
the
following
paper
reference1
:
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/901/01/paper05.pdf
the
method
is
based
in
the
following
paper
reference2
:
http://www.stanford.edu/~cover/papers/paper91.pdf
any
help
(
theoritical
or
othwerwise
)
will
be
deeply
appreciated
.
thanks
