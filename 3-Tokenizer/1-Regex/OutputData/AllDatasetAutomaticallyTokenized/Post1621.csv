Recently
","
I'm
working
on
a
gevent
demo
and
I
try
to
compare
the
efficiency
between
gevent
and
thread
.
Generally
speakingï¼Œthe
gevent
code
should
be
more
efficient
than
the
thread
code
.
But
when
I
use
time
command
to
profile
the
program
","
I
get
the
unusual
"result(my command is time python FILENAME.py 50 1000,the last two parameters means pool number or thread number,so I change the two number in the table below)"
.
The
result
shows
that
the
thread
is
more
efficient
than
the
gevent
code
","
so
I
want
to
know
why
this
happen
and
what's
wrong
with
my
program
?
Thanks
.
gevent
VS
thread
My
code
is
below(The main idea is use thread or gevent to send multi HTTP request)
:
*
*
*
*
*
*
This
is
the
thread
version
code
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
This
is
the
gevent
verison
code
