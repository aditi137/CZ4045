I
have
been
using
the
logging
module
in
Python
for
a
while
.
My
doubt
is
not
so
much
a
technical
one
","
but
that
I
am
not
sure
of
the
best
practices
with
the
messages
.
The
issue
is
that
sometimes
an
event
happens
and
I
want
to
dump
information
about
it
in
the
log
","
but
a
lot
of
information
.
I
can
build
a
single
long
string
","
and
use
it
in
an
log.info()
command
.
That
is
alright
","
except
for
the
fact
that
the
result
is
hardly
human-readable
.
Introducing
the
character
'
\
n
'
in
the
string
indeed
breaks
the
message
into
separate
lines
in
the
log
file
","
but
left-justified
","
it
looks
ugly
because
in
the
beginning
of
the
logging
formatter
I
am
writing
the
date
/
time
","
user
","
etc.
On
the
other
hand
I
can
split
the
message
into
different
calls
to
log.info()
","
but
that
makes
it
look
as
if
they
were
different
events
.
EDIT
:
Additional
information
.
If
I
do
different
log
calls
","
it
looks
like
What
is
the
usual
/
best
practice
here
?
I
think
I
would
like
something
like
