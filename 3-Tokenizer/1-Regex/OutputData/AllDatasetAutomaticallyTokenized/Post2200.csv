Have
you
consider
using
Unix
Epoch
Time
instead
of
a
date
formatted
in
a
lesser
manner
?
There
is
a
well
documented
answer
for
converting
to
Unix
Time
","
and
dealing
with
the
sort
of
offset
in
the
question
seems
like
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
as
sliding
ranges
are
simpler
to
implement
with
a
more
or
less
continuous
sequence
of
real
numeric
values
.
