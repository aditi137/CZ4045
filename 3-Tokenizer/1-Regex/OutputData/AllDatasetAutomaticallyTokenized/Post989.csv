You
will
need
to
parse
the
settings
from
the
INI
file
yourself
.
Pylons
used
to
do
this
automatically
for
you
by
just
hard-coding
a
load
for
""""
test.ini
""""
.
The
two
options
you
have
are
1
)
just
load
the
INI
settings
via
settings
=
paste.deploy.appconfig('test.ini')
or
2
)
loading
the
actual
WSGI
app
yourself
","
like
if
you
wanted
to
use
it
via
WebTest
app
=
pyramid.paster.get_app('test.ini')
which
would
parse
the
INI
file
and
return
an
actual
WSGI
app
.
Unfortunately
that
route
doesn't
give
you
access
to
the
INI
file
directly
","
it
automatically
just
passes
the
settings
to
your
app's
startup
function
"main(global_conf, **settings)"
.
You
may
also
find
the
Pyramid
docs
on
functional
tests
useful
.
