You
can
achieve
same
result
in
Tensorflow
using
not_equal
and
where
methods
.
where
is
a
tensor
of
the
same
shape
as
A
holding
True
or
False
","
in
the
following
case
This
would
be
sufficient
to
select
zero
or
non-zero
elements
from
A
.
If
you
want
to
obtain
indices
you
can
use
wheremethod
as
follows
:
where
tensor
has
two
True
values
so
indices
tensor
will
have
two
entries
.
where
tensor
has
rank
of
two
","
so
entries
will
have
two
indices
:
