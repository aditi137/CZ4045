Is
there
a
way
I
can
filter
a
directory
by
using
the
absolute
path
to
it
?
This
doesn't
seem
to
work
when
trying
to
filter
the
""""
Common
""""
Directory
located
under
""""
aDir
""""
.
If
I
do
this
:
It
works
","
but
every
directory
called
Common
will
be
filtered
in
that
""""
tree
""""
","
which
is
not
what
I
want
.
Any
suggestions
?
Thanks
.
