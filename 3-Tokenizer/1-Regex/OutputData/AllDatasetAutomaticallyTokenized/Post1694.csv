I
am
using
Pandas
to
work
with
large
number
of
Data
.
I
want
to
find
the
fastest
way
to
get
the
first
row
in
DataFrame
with
id
I
need
to
loop
through
all
rows
in
school_detail
to
set
type
for
each
row
.
I
have
use
%
prun
to
check
time
for
function
get
school
by
id
.
It
is
about
0.03
sec
When
I
run
with
10000
rows
of
school_detail
.
It
takes
43
sec
.
If
I
run
with
20
mil
rows
.
It
may
take
several
hours
.
My
questions
:
I
want
to
find
the
better
way
to
get
school
by
id
to
make
it
run
faster
.
The
id
column
is
unique
.
Do
pandas
use
binary
search
in
this
column
?
