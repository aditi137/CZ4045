do
I
need
to
gut
what
I
have
to
start
passing
signals
?
yes
you
do
.
You
can
always
have
your
""""
other
thread
""""
be
QObject
based
and
have
a
QObject
from
QApplication's
children
based
object
as
parent
","
and
call
the
moveToThread()
method
but
it's
better
to
have
the
main
thread
handle
GUI
","
and
other
threads
send
signals
to
the
main
thread
to
have
it
updated
.
Take
the
opportunity
of
moving
from
GTK
to
QT
","
to
actually
redesign
correctly
your
application
","
with
real
decoupling
between
the
main
components
of
your
software
.
