I'm
trying
to
use
the
GIMP
python
plugin
Density
Brush
Fill
.
In
one
place
","
it
assumes
that
it's
being
used
on
a
color
image
and
crashes
when
used
with
a
greyscale
one
:
The
fix
would
be
quite
easy
however
I
haven't
found
any
API
documentation
for
image
.
How
to
get
the
type
(
color
or
greyscale
)
of
the
image
?
