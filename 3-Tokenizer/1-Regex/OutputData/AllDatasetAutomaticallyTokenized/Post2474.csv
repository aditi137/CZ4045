My
question
is
related
to
this
Tensorflow
:
How
to
get
a
tensor
by
name
?
I
can
give
names
to
operations
.
But
actually
they
named
differently
.
For
example
:
tf.get_variable
creates
variable
with
exactly
the
same
name
as
I
ask
.
Operations
add
prefixes
to
scope
.
I
want
to
name
my
operation
so
that
I
can
get
it
.
In
my
case
I
want
to
get
b
with
tf.get_variable('b')
in
my
scope
.
How
can
I
do
it
?
I
can't
do
it
with
tf.Variable
because
of
this
issue
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1325
May
be
I
need
to
set
addition
parameters
to
variable
scope
","
or
to
operation
","
or
somehow
use
tf.get_variable
?
