Seems
has
been
updated
your
default
anaconda
and
python
folder
to
python
3
.
Easy
way
is
to
remove
anaconda
folder
listed
and
download
python
2.7.11
from
anaconda
and
reinstall
.
In
case
you
have
anaconda
and
anaconda3
in
your
system
than
you
can
update
the
path
according
with
your
needs
:
export
PATH=$HOME
/
anaconda
/
bin:$PATH
or
export
PATH=$HOME
/
anaconda3
/
bin:$PATH
.
Hope
it
helps
.
