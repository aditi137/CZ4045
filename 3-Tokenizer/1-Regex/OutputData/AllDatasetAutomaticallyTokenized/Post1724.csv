You'd
use
a
conditional
expression
instead
:
This
is
part
of
the
left-hand
element-producing
expression
","
not
the
list
comprehension
syntax
itself
","
where
if
statements
act
as
a
filter
.
The
conditional
expression
uses
the
form
true_expression
if
test_expression
else
false_expression
;
it
always
produces
a
value
.
I
simplified
the
expression
a
little
;
if
you
are
replacing
""""
-
-
""""
with
""""
hello
""""
you
may
as
well
just
return
""""
hello
""""
.
