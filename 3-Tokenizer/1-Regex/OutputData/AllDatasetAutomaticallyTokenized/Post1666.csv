I'm
writing
a
Django
view
that
gets
the
latest
blog
posts
of
a
wordpress
system
.
I
tried
in
a
terminal
to
use
ETags
:
I'd
like
to
avoid
requesting
the
feed
for
every
user
of
the
web
app
.
maybe
etag
aren't
the
best
option
?
Once
the
first
user
sees
this
view
","
can
I
store
the
etag
and
use
it
for
all
the
other
users
?
is
there
a
thread
for
every
user
and
therefore
I
can't
share
the
value
of
a
variable
this
way
?
