I've
modified
a
.
py
file
on
a
production
server
and
the
changes
are
not
being
applied
.
At
first
I
thought
this
was
because
the
associated
.
pyc
file
was
not
being
updated
.
So
I
deleted
the
.
pyc
file
and
tested
hoping
the
.
py
file
would
compile
into
a
new
.
pyc
file
.
The
applications
behavior
did
not
update
and
a
new
.
pyc
file
was
not
created
.
This
was
done
based
off
a
previous
question
.
How
is
it
that
the
script
is
executing
without
generating
a
new
.
pyc
file
?
Here
are
the
two
files
in
question
:
admin_email.pyc
has
been
deleted
.
Only
admin_email.py
remains
on
there
server
.
Here
is
the
code
that
is
executing
the
script
that
has
been
changed
:
The
application
is
being
served
with
gunicorn
+
nginx
.
Any
ideas
on
what
the
issue
is
?
Why
is
a
new
.
pyc
file
being
created
?
More
importantly
why
is
the
applications
behavior
not
being
updated
?
