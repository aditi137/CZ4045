I
have
often
found
that
learning
another
language
","
especially
a
dynamically
typed
language
","
can
teach
you
things
about
other
languages
and
make
you
an
overall
better
programmer
.
Learning
ruby
","
for
example
","
will
teach
you
Object
Oriented
programming
in
ways
Java
wont
","
and
vice
versa
.
All
in
all
","
I
believe
that
it
is
better
to
be
a
well
rounded
programmer
than
stuck
in
a
single
language
.
It
makes
you
more
valuable
to
the
companies
/
clients
you
work
for
.
