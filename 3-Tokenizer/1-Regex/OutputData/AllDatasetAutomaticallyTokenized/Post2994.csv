I
have
a
pure
Python
module
and
I
want
to
rewrite
some
of
submodules
using
Cython
.
Then
I
would
like
to
add
the
new
Cython
submodules
to
the
original
Python
module
and
make
them
available
only
as
an
option
","
meaning
that
cythoning
the
module
is
not
compulsory
(
in
which
case
the
'
old
'
pure
Python
module
should
be
used
)
.
Here
is
an
example
:
where
a.py
contains
import b
.
I
want
to
write
b.py
in
Cython
.
The
idea
would
be
to
add
a
folder
containing
the
.
pyx
file
","
for
example
:
setup.py
would
contain
the
direction
to
compile
b.pyx
and
to
install
the
module
.
However
","
I
would
like
that
if
someone
runs
python
setup.py
install
then
the
pure
Python
code
is
installed
","
whereas
if
an
option
is
added
then
the
Cython
code
is
compiled
and
installed
.
Any
idea
how
to
do
that
?
Also
","
how
should
the
file
a.py
be
modified
in
order
to
import the
correct
module
?
