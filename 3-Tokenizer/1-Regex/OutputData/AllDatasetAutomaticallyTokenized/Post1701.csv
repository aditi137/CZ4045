If
one
axis
is
the
cluster
id
I
don't
get
how
you
fit
both
the
x
and
y
coordinates
onto
the
other
axis
.
So
I
plotted
the
x
","
y
on
the
x
and
y
axis
and
used
the
cluster
id
as
a
label
;
you
can
swap
which
value
goes
into
which
axis
","
I
guess
:
N.b
.
:
if
you
have
a
lot
of
data
","
don't
call
scatter
for
each
point
separately
;
append
x
","
y
","
cluster
to
three
separate
lists
and
scatter
the
lists
.
