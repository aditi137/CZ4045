I
am
trying
to
solve
one
problem
according
to
above
input
","
output
.
So
far
I
can
read
only
first
block
Text
.
I
want
to
more
generic
function
so
possibly
I
will
only
initialise
the
variable
that
need
to
read
within
the
block
","
not
hard
coding
(
e.g
.
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
A
Result
:
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
)
and
furthermore
pass
the
block
info
to
another
function
that
will
sum
up
the
value
.
Any
suggestion
will
be
greatly
appreciate
.
Thanks
