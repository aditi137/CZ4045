Using
multiple
server
instances
on
local
ports
is
a
good
idea
","
but
you
don't
need
a
full
featured
web
server
to
redirect
HTTP
requests
.
I
would
use
pound
as
a
reverse
proxy
to
do
the
job
.
It
is
small
","
fast
","
simple
and
does
exactly
what
we
need
here
.
WHAT
POUND
IS
:
a
reverse-proxy
:
it
passes
requests
from
client
browsers
to
one
or
more
back-end
servers
.
a
load
balancer
:
it
will
distribute
the
requests
from
the
client
browsers
among
several
back-end
servers
","
while
keeping
session
information
.
an
SSL
wrapper
:
Pound
will
decrypt
HTTPS
requests
from
client
browsers
and
pass
them
as
plain
HTTP
to
the
back-end
servers
.
an
HTTP
/
HTTPS
sanitizer
:
Pound
will
verify
requests
for
correctness
and
accept
only
well-formed
ones
.
a
fail
over-server
:
should
a
back-end
server
fail
","
Pound
will
take
note
of
the
fact
and
stop
passing
requests
to
it
until
it
recovers
.
a
request
redirector
:
requests
may
be
distributed
among
servers
according
to
the
requested
URL
.
