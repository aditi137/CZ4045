If
you
'
don't
declare
fields
","
they
won't
be
accessible
in
the
bundle
.
However
","
they'll
always
be
accessible
in
the
request
.
You'll
need
to
have
at
least
one
predefined
field
","
to
be
used
as
a
primary
key
.
While
you
don't
explicitly
need
to
create
it
","
you
should
have
a
way
of
knowing
what
object
to
return
if
the
user
issues
a
GET
request
for
some
object
.
