This
is
an
idea
of
what
I
mentioned
in
the
comment
You
can
also
go
as
far
as
to
do
something
like
html.find(ID)
>
-
1
:
do
something
else
the
ID
wasn't
present
on
the
page
so
quit
or
reload
.
Also
more
then
anything
else
it's
probably
better
to
move
inside
the
while
loop
because
so
that
the
object
is
the
correct
object
through
everyloop
.
What
could
be
happening
is
that
you're
using
elements
that
belonged
to
a
different
dom
.
