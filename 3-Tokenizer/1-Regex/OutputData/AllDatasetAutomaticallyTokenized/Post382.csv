I
need
to
read
selected
files
","
matching
on
the
file
name
","
from
a
remote
zip
archive
using
Python
.
I
don't
want
to
save
the
full
zip
to
a
temporary
file
(
it's
not
that
large
","
so
I
can
handle
everything
in
memory
)
.
I've
already
written
the
code
and
it
works
","
and
I'm
answering
this
myself
so
I
can
search
for
it
later
.
But
since
evidence
suggests
that
I'm
one
of
the
dumber
participants
on
Stackoverflow
","
I'm
sure
there's
room
for
improvement
.
