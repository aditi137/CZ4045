I
have
just
had
this
issue
.
It
arises
when
you
run
pytest
from
the
wrong
directory
","
e.g
.
wherever
you
happen
to
be
after
you
installed
it
.
To
solve
","
create
a
new
directory
and
cd
into
that
directory
create
the
file
test_sample.py
in
your
directory
with
content
as
per
the
pytest
tutorial
now
run
the
command
pytest
and
you
will
see
the
result
that
is
shown
in
the
tutorial
.
I'm
new
to
this
myself
but
I
believe
pytest
searches
the
directory
structure
from
where
it
is
run
looking
for
tests
.
Run
it
from
the
wrong
place
and
you'll
get
some
strange
results
if
it
sees
something
that
it
thinks
might
be
a
test
.
