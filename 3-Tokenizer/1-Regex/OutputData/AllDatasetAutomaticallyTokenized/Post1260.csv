Unpickling
a
pickle
amounts
to
executing
arbitrary
code
.
An
attacker
can
create
a
pickle
which
will
execute
system
commands
during
unpickling
.
Here's
an
example
from
a
good
blog
post
on
the
topic
:
This
clearly
states
that
pickle
is
insecure
.
Many
think
this
is
because
it
can
load
classes
other
than
what
you
expect
and
may
trick
you
to
run
their
functions
.
But
the
actual
security
risk
is
far
more
dangerous
.
Unpickling
can
be
exploited
to
execute
arbitrary
commands
on
your
machine
!
