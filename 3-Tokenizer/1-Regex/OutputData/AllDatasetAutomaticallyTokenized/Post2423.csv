The
error
you
are
getting
is
because
you
are
trying
to
index
a
list
using
a
tensor
.
One
way
to
solve
this
will
be
to
turn
the
list
into
a
tensor
.
Alternatively
you
can
use
pmc.switch()
to
choose
between
priors
and
pseudopriors
","
something
like
:
I
did
not
check
your
code
thoroughly

but

you

Instead
","
you
should
write

I

port
a
pseudoprior
example
.
I
will
do
it
ASAP

EDITED
Here
if
the
full
model
Notice
that
your
code
had
several
issues
","
like
missing
parenthesis
in
the
definition
of
the
variable
b
and
the
order
of
the
prior
and
pseudopriors
was
inverted
.
Additionally
I
change
the
code
in
ordet
to
let
aBeta
","
bBeta
and
thetahave
shape=nCond
","
and
then
in
the
likellihood
define
p
as
p=theta
[cond_idx]
.
I
did
not
check
the
results
against
Kruschke's
book
","
but
the
trace
look
reasonable
.
