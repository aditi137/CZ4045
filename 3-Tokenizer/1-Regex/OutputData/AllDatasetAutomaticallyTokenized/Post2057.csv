I'm
writing
a
small
python
program
locally
as
i
don't
have
root
access
on
the
server
.
It
basically
does
a
lot
of
mysql
queries
using
python
MySQLdb
module
.
The
thing
is
I
cant
use
MySQLdb
with
the
server
","
as
the
mysql
server
is
hosted
locally
and
I
need
to
ssh
into
the
server
and
then
use
mysql
from
there
.
Is
there
any
module
available
where
I
can
connect
to
a
mysql
database
via
SSH
.
At
the
moment
I
can
connect
to
the
mysql
instance
using
SSH
credentials
(
IP
","
User
","
Pass
)
I
also
have
the
user
/
pass
for
the
mysql
instance
and
I'm
pretty
sure
it
runs
on
127.0.0.1
/
localhost
.
