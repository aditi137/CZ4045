The
treeview
widget
has
a
method
named
column
which
lets
you
specify
options
for
a
given
column
.
One
of
the
options
is
stretch
","
which
lets
you
determine
whether
the
column
should
stretch
and
shrink
when
the
widget
is
resized
.
You
can
also
use
the
width
attribute
to
specify
the
starting
size
.
These
two
combined
should
cause
your
treeview
to
appear
with
all
of
the
columns
fitting
on
the
screen
.
