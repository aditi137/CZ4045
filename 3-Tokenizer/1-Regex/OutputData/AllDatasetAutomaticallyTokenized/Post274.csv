As
you
switch
between
these
languages
that
each
of
them
has
their
own
constructs
and
philosophies
behind
the
problems
that
they
try
to
solve
.
This
will
help
you
when
finding
the
right
tool
for
the
job

the
domain
of
a

The
role
of
the
compiler
(
or
interpreter
for
some
languages
)
becomes
more
prominent
.
Why
is
Ruby's
type
system
differ
from
the

Net
/
C
#
system
?
What
problems
do
each
of
these
solve
?
You'll
find
yourself
understanding
at
a
lower
level
the
constructs
of
the
compiler
and
its
influence
on
the
language

Switching
between
Ruby
and
C
#
really
helped
me
to
understand
Design
Patterns
better
.
I
really
suggest
implementing
common
design
patterns
in
a
language
like
C
#
and
then
in
a
language
like
Ruby
.
It
often
helped
me
see
through
some
of
the
compiler
ceremony
to
the
philosophy
of
a
particular
pattern
.

A

C

Java

Ruby

Python

all
have
different
communities

can
help
engage

It

a

way
to
take
your
