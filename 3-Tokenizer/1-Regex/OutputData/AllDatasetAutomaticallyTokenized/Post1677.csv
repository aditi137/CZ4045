Is
there
a
way
to
generate
sitemaps
on
the
fly
and
regularly
submit
them
to
Google
using
Pyramid
?
I've
seen
2
code
snippets
(
here
and
here
)
for
doing
this
in
Flask
","
but
they
don't
seem
applicable
to
Pyramid
.
Specifically
","
when
I
include
"config.add_route('sitemap', '/sitemap.xml')"
in
__init__.py
and
then
the
following
view
:
I
get
an
error
:
Changing
the
view
to
:
Gets
past
the
KeyError
from
before
","
but
gives
me
a
404
when
I
try
navigating
to
mysite.com
/
static
/
sitemap.xml
.
What's
going
on
?
EDIT
:
This
is
my
sitemap.jinja2
file
.
