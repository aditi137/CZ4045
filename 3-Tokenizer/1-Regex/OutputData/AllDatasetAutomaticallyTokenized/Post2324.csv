you
can
use
the
context
manager
.
This
will
ensure
that
the
FileDialog
will
be
destroyed
without
you
having
to
worry
about
","
by
checking
the
return
code
""""
wx.ID_OK
""""
and
by
using
the
style
""""
wx.FD_FILE_MUST_EXIST
""""
you
know
that
a
file
was
selected
.
If
you
need
a
special
handling
of
the
cancel
dialog
you
can
do
that
with
an
'
elif
'
.
