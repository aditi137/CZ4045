Consider
the
sliders_app.py
example
in
Bokeh
.
I
would
like
to
have
the
ability
to
update
the
plot
at
regular
time
intervals
.
For
example
","
say
we
want
to
time-shift
the
plot
every
10
seconds
.
How
can
I
do
this
in
the
context
of
an
app
?
To
illustrate
the
goal
","
I
would
like
to
add
the
following
extremely
simple
logic
to
the
app
that
simply
shifts
X
and
Y
cyclically
.
Note
that
there
is
no
easy
way
to
insert
this
loop
into
the
original
sliders_app.py
(
where
would
it
go
?
)
.
Is
there
any
way
to
do
this
in
Bokeh
?
Does
Bokeh
perhaps
have
any
timer
widgets
to
which
one
could
hook
up
a
timer
callback
to
update
data
sources
?
If
not
","
is
there
a
plan
to
incorporate
this
functionality
some
time
down
the
road
?
Update
It
looks
like
spectrogram.py
uses
threading
to
handle
this
type
of
updates
.
For
anyone
interested
","
this
may
be
the
way
to
pull
it
off
.
