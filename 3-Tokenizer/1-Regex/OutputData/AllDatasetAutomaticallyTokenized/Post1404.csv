Suppose
","
I
need
to
count
collisions
for
various
schemes
of
hashes
.
Number
of
elements
in
input
sequence
is
1e10^8
and
more
.
Don't
know
how
to
count
this
analytically
","
so
using
brute-force
.
It's
obvious
not
to
keep
this
list
of
hashes
in
RAM
.
That
is
the
best
way
to
write
a
code
for
my
needs
?
Should
i
dump
it
in
database
or
something
?
What
libraries
are
preferred
to
use
?
Thank
you
!
