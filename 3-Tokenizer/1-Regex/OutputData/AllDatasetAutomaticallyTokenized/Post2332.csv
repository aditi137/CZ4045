I
of
course
don't
know
what
you're
doing
exactly
","
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
trying
to
do
too
much
inside
of
one
function
.
Your
problem
might
be
better
solved
by
simply
splitting
up
the
contents
of
external_func
.
The
goals
here
","
as
I
understand
them
","
are
you
don't
know
ahead
of
time
what
the
object
/
method
pair
will
be
","
and
want
to
reduce
code
repetition
.
Perhaps
something
like
this
would
be
better
:
I
understand
this
is
more
code
","
but
I
think
in
the
end
it's
a
lot
clearer
what
is
happening
","
and
also
might
force
you
to
think
through
your
problem
a
bit
more
(
and
potentially
come
up
with
an
even
better
solution
)
.
