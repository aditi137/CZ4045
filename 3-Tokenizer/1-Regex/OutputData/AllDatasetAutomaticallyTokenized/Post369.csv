I
am
attempting
to
use
the
'
tempfile
'
module
for
manipulating
and
creating
text
files
.
Once
the
file
is
ready
I
want
to
save
it
to
disk
.
I
thought
it
would
be
as
simple
as
using
'
shutil.copy
'
.
However
","
I
get
a
'
permission
denied
'
IOError
:
Is
this
not
intended
when
using
the
'
tempfile
'
library
?
Is
there
a
better
way
to
do
this
?
(
Maybe
I
am
overlooking
something
very
trivial
)
