reduce
reduces
an
iterable
down
to
a
single
object
","
so
after
this
line
args
is
not
an
iterable
.
This
reduces
args
down
to
a
single
Q
object
that
ORs
all
of
the
items
in
query_word_list
together
.
If
you
want
to
pass
it
using
the
*
syntax
","
you'll
need
to
wrap
it
in
an
iterable
","
i.e.
args
=
(
args
","
)
.
