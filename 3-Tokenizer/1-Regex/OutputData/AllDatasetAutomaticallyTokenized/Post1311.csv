You
have
datetime.timedelta()
objects
.
These
have
.
microseconds
","
.
seconds
and
.
days
attributes
","
all
3
integers
.
The
str()
string
representation
represents
those
as
[
D
day
[s]
","
]
[H]
H:MM:SS
[
.
UUUUUU
]
as
needed
to
fit
all
values
present
.
You
can
use
simple
arithmetic
on
these
objects
.
Summing
and
division
work
as
expected
","
for
example
:
Unfortunately
","
you
cannot
multiply
two
timedeltas
and
calculating
a
standard
deviation
thus
becomes
tricky
(
no
squaring
of
offsets
)
.
Instead
","
I'd
use
the
.
total_seconds()
method
","
to
give
you
a
floating
point
value
that
is
calculated
from
the
days
","
seconds
and
microseconds
values
","
then
use
those
values
to
calculate
a
standard
deviation
.
