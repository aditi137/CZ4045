Names
for
slots
only
take
memory
per
class
","
not
per
instance
.
Slots
use
descriptors
that
map
directly
into
the
memory
reserved
for
an
instance
","
and
the
attribute
names
are
mapped
to
these
descriptors
on
the
class
.
Thus
","
the
length
of
the
names
has
no
influence
on
how
much
memory
each
instance
uses
for
the
slots
;
the
names
only
take
space
in
the
__dict__
attribute
on
the
class
(
mapping
name
to
descriptor
)
","
and
in
the
descriptor
object
itself
(
to
provide
a
string
representation
of
the
object
)
;
the
string
is
interned
even
.
You
can
check
how
the
custom
descriptors
are
given
their
state
in
the
C
source
code
for
type.__new__()
:
where
mp->offset
is
the
index
into
the
memory
for
the
instance
.
The
descriptor
used
is
a
PyMemberDescr_Type
object
","
whose
member_get
function
uses
the
(
very
generic
)
PyMember_GetOne()
function
;
with
the
offset
the
pointer
is
retrieved
from
the
instance
:
addr
is
the
memory
address
of
the
instance
.
The
rest
of
the
function
deals
with
various
types
of
members
;
the
slot
member
is
always
set
to
type
T_OBJECT
:
which
the
function
then
returns
.
