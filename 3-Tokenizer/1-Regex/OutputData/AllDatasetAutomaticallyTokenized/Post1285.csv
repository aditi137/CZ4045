My
function
is
made
to
get
the
area
of
any
arbitrary
triangle
.
Here
is
the
way
that
I
know
works
However
","
I
think
this
is
crap
so
here's
what
I
had
as
a
sketched
out
thought
","
However
","
this
apparently
doesn't
play
too
nice
with
lists
.
I
thought
this
would
work
in
the
way
that
once
can
get
keys
and
values
from
dictionaries...but
lists
don't
have
the
iteritems()
method
.
Then
I
thought
about
converting
the
lists
into
dictionaries
","
but
the
keys
are
unique
in
dicts
and
hence
they
only
pop
up
once....which
would
make
my
function
not
work
properly
.
