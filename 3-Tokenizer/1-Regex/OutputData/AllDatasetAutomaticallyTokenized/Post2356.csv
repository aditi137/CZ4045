I
am
a
newbie
to
Python
and
I
have
a
dataframe
which
I
have
created
from
a
query
against
Postgresql
database
via
the
read_sql
function
in
Pandas
like
this
:
The
data
that
comes
back
has
three
columns
and
they
are
daily
data
like
this
:
Now
","
I
am
trying
to
resample
this
data
so
that
only
the
business
monthend
values
come
back
","
and
if
I
do
this
:
the
ID(non-numeric)
column
drops
off
automatically
","
and
if
I
restack
the
id
column
back
as
some
other
questions
posted
suggest
","
it
gives
me
an
error
.
I
have
been
trying
different
combinations
as
suggested
by
various
posts
and
still
no
luck
.
I
will
appreciate
it
if
someone
can
shed
some
light
on
this
.
Thanks
so
much
.
