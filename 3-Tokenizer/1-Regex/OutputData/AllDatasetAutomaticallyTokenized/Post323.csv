I
am
relatively
new
to
Python
","
and
I
have
always
used
the
standard
cpython
(
v2.5
)
implementation
.
I've
been
wondering
about
the
other
implementations
though
","
particularly
Jython
and
IronPython
.
What
makes
them
better
?
What
makes
them
worse
?
What
other
implementations
are
there
?
I
guess
what
I'm
looking
for
is
a
summary
and
list
of
pros
and
cons
for
each
implementation
.
