You
have
a
situation
that
looks
like
this
:
i.e.
three
references
to
the
same
underlying
object
.
All
that
del
h
does
is
remove
the
name
h
","
like
this
:
The
underlying
object
doesn't
change
","
and
the
two
other
names
still
provide
a
reference
to
it
","
all
you've
done
is
remove
one
reference
to
the
Foo
instance
.
h
is
now
a
NameError
","
but
g
and
f.attr
will
work
just
fine
.
I
don't
know
why
you
would
conclude
that
-
if
you
did
succeed
in
breaking
the
reference
from
f.attr
to
the
Foo
instance
","
you
would
get
an
AttributeError
","
not
None
.
