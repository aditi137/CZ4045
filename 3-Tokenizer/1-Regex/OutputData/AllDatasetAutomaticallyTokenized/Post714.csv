By
default
collection.find
or
collection.findone()
functions
results
in
a
dictionary
types
and
if
you
pass
paramater
as_class=SomeUserClass
than
it
will
try
to
parse
the
result
into
this
class
format
.
but
it
seems
this
class
should
also
be
derived
class
of
dictionary
(
as
it
required
__setitem__
function
to
be
defined
and
i
can
add
keys
in
the
class
)
.
Here
i
want
to
set
the
properties
of
the
class
.
how
can
i
do
achieve
this
?
Also
","
my
collection
class
contains
some
child
classes
as
properties
.
So
how
can
i
set
the
properties
of
child
classes
also
.
