I
switched
from
Perl
to
Python
about
a
year
ago
and
haven't
looked
back
.
There
is
only
one
idiom
that
I've
ever
found
I
can
do
more
easily
in
Perl
than
in
Python
:
The
corresponding
Python
code
is
not
so
elegant
since
the
if
statements
keep
getting
nested
:
Does
anyone
have
an
elegant
way
to
reproduce
this
pattern
in
Python
?
I've
seen
anonymous
function
dispatch
tables
used
","
but
those
seem
kind
of
unwieldy
to
me
for
a
small
number
of
regular
expressions
...
