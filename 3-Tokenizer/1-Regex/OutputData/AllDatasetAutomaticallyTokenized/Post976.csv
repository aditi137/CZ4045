Your
original
idea
will
work
if
you
instead
call
these
functions
and
then
add
their
return
values
","
rather
than
trying
to
add
them
themselves
;
This
is
because
f
and
g
are
actually
LambdaTypes
","
and
the
(
)
operator
calls
them
","
allowing
the
+
operator
to
add
their
return
values
.
When
you
use
the
+
operator
on
them
directly
","
the
+
operator
doesn't
know
how
to
add
two
LambdaTypes
.
EDIT
To
add
a
little
more
;
the
reason
doesn't
work
is
because
you
are
","
again
","
trying
to
add
together
two
function
objects
.
However
","
your
example
of
WILL
work
","
because
this
will
simply
return
another
function
object
","
which
is
then
called
with
an
argument
of
value
10
in
your
statement
