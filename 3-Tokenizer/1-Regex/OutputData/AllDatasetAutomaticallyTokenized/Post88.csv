Is
your
problem
convex
?
Linear
?
Non-linear
?
I
agree
that
SciPy.optimize
will
probably
do
the
job
","
but
fmincon
is
a
sort
of
bazooka
for
solving
optimization
problems
","
and
you'll
be
better
off
if
you
can
confine
it
to
one
of
the
categories
below
(
in
increasing
level
of
difficulty
to
solve
efficiently
)
Linear
Program
(
LP
)
Quadratic
Program
(
QP
)
Convex
Quadratically-Constrained
Quadratic
Program
(
QCQP
)
Second
Order
Cone
Program
(
SOCP
)
Semidefinite
Program
(
SDP
)
Non-Linear
Convex
Problem
Non-Convex
Problem
There
are
also
combinatoric
problems
such
as
Mixed-Integer
Linear
Programs
(
MILP
)
","
but
you
didn't
mention
any
sort
of
integrality
constraints
","
suffice
to
say
that
they
fall
into
a
different
class
of
problems
.
The
CVXOpt
package
will
be
of
great
use
to
you
if
your
problem
is
convex
.
If
your
problem
is
not
convex
","
you
need
to
choose
between
finding
a
local
solution
or
the
global
solution
.
Many
convex
solvers
'
sort
of
'
work
in
a
non-convex
domain
.
Finding
a
good
approximation
to
the
global
solution
would
require
some
form
Simulated
Annealing
or
Genetic
Algorithm
.
Finding
the
global
solution
will
require
an
enumeration
of
all
local
solutions
or
a
combinatorial
strategy
such
as
Branch
and
Bound
.
