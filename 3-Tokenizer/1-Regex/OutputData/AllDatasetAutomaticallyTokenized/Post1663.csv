I
have
a
series
of
strings
which
are
identifiable
by
finding
a
substring
""""
p
""""
tag
followed
by
at
least
two
CAPITAL
letters
.
Input
:
I
want
to
change
the
""""
p
""""
tag
to
an
""""
i
""""
tag
if
it's
followed
by
those
two
capital
letters
(
so
not
the
last
one
","
'
Eric
'
)
.
Desired
output
:
I've
tried
this
using
regular
expressions
in
Python
:
But
the
output
uses
""""
i
""""
tag
+
JI
in
every
instance
","
rather
than
interating
through
to
use
SA
and
then
RO
in
entries
2
and
3
.
I
believe
the
problem
is
that
I
don't
understand
the
.
group()
method
properly
.
Can
anyone
advise
what
I've
done
wrong
?
Thank
you
.
