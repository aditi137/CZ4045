This
question
maybe
trivial
.
How
do
I
add
a
year
starting
with
1903
ending
with
2009
to
106
items
on
a
list
without
creating
a
long
HUGE
list
of
years
But
bypass
ones
with
a
year
?
For
Example
:
To
this
:
While
I
know
you
can
add
a
number
count
to
each
item
on
list
I
tried
:
I
get
TypeError
:
'
function
'
object
is
not
iterable
But
this
is
new
to
me
.
I
would
normally
have
more
to
show
but
I
really
don't
have
any
Idea
how
to
code
this
at
all
.
