"copy2(src,dst)"
is
often
more
useful
than
"copyfile(src,dst)"
because
:
it
allows
dst
to
be
a
directory
(
instead
of
the
complete
target
filename
)
","
in
which
case
the
basename
of
src
is
used
for
creating
the
new
file
;
it
preserves
the
original
modification
and
access
info
(
mtime
and
atime
)
in
the
file
metadata
(
however
","
this
comes
with
a
slight
overhead
)
.
Here
is
a
short
example
:
