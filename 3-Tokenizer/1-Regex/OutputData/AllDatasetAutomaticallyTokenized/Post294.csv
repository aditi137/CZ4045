The
short
answer
is
:
most
of
the
time
time.clock()
will
be
better
.
However
","
if
you're
timing
some
hardware
(
for
example
some
algorithm
you
put
in
the
GPU
)
","
then
time.clock()
will
get
rid
of
this
time
and
time.time()
is
the
only
solution
left
.
Note
:
whatever
the
method
used
","
the
timing
will
depend
on
factors
you
cannot
control
(
when
will
the
process
switch
","
how
often
","
...
)
","
this
is
worse
with
time.time()
but
exists
also
with
time.clock()
","
so
you
should
never
run
one
timing
test
only
","
but
always
run
a
series
of
test
and
look
at
mean
/
variance
of
the
times
.
