I
would
like
to
run
a
project
(
project.py
)
that
has
two
scheduling
elements
like
this
answer
I
found
on
stack
overflow
:
Periodically
execute
function
in
thread
in
real
time
","
every
N
seconds
One
function
is
to
run
every
x
seconds
the
other
every
y
seconds
where
0.03
<
x
<
0.1
and
2
<
y
<
10
.
function_x(t)
calls
an
outside
program
(
sync.py
)
that
pauses
(
SIGSTOP
)
project.py
Question
0
:
After
calling
do_every
","
the
program
continues
it's
execution
.
Is
this
a
correct
assumption
?
Question
1
:
If
sync.py
takes
2
seconds
to
execute
before
calling
SIGCONT
on
project.py
","
will
function_x's
Timer
be
'
messed
up
'
?
Question
3
:
If
function_y
is
sending
data
over
a
socket
","
will
function_x
calling
SIGSTOP
mess
up
this
execution
?
Will
the
timing
be
paused
?
How
does
the
timer
count
time
?
