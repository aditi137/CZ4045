Ok
so
it
is
like
this
.
I'd
rather
not
give
away
my
code
but
if
you
really
need
it
I
will
.
I
have
two
modules
that
need
a
bit
from
each
other
.
the
modules
are
called
webhandler
and
datahandler
.
In
webhandler
I
have
a
line
:
and
in
datahandler
I
have
another
line
:
Now
I
know
this
is
terrible
code
and
a
circular
import like
this
causes
the
code
to
run
twice
(
which
is
what
im
trying
to
avoid
)
.
However
the
datahandler
module
needs
to
access
several
functions
from
the
webhandler
module
","
and
the
webhandler
module
needs
access
to
several
variables
that
are
generated
in
the
datahandler
module
.
I
dont
see
any
workaround
other
than
moving
functions
to
different
modules
but
that
would
ruin
the
organisation
of
my
program
and
make
no
logical
sense
with
the
module
naming
.
Any
help
?
