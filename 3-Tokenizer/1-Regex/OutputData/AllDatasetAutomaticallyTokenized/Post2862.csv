I
have
a
numpy
bytes
array
containing
characters
","
followed
by
b
'
'
","
followed
by
others
characters
(
including
weird
characters
which
raise
Unicode
errors
when
decoding
)
:
I
want
to
get
everything
before
the
first
b
'
'
.
Currently
my
code
is
:
I
suppose
there
is
a
more
efficient
and
Pythonic
way
to
do
that
.
Any
idea
?
