So
i
am
trying
to
call
the
mysql
function
TIMEDATEDIFF
with
the
SECOND
constant
as
the
first
parameter
like
so
I
have
tried
it
as
a
string
and
I
get
a
mysql
/
mariadb
error
:
Gives
me
this
I
am
sure
it
is
something
simple
","
some
sort
of
escape
sequence
or
import that
I
am
missing
.
I
have
looked
through
the
sqlalchemy
documentation
to
no
avail
.
