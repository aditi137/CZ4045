I'm
using
Windows
7
and
8
(
and
10TP
)
and
Python
3.4.2
.
I
started
with
ipython
locate
to
tell
me
where
ipython
thought
config
files
suggested
elsewhere
should
be
.
When
I
saw
it
was
different
I
read
around
and
came
up
with
the
following
:
On
my
system
","
the
ipython
locate
gave
me
c:\users\osmith\.ipython
","
not
the
_ipython
you'll
see
mentioned
in
the
YouTube
videos
done
with
Windows
XP
","
Look
in
the
directory
ipython
locate
specifies
for
a
profile
directory
;
if
you
aren't
actively
doing
anything
with
ipython
profiles
","
it
should
be
.
ipython\profile_default
","
if
you
are
using
profiles
","
then
I
leave
it
to
you
to
s
/
profile_default
/
${YOUR_PROFILE_NAME
}
/
g
Check
the
profile_default
directory
for
a
ipython_config.py
file
","
if
it's
not
there
","
tell
IPython
to
initialize
itself
:
ipython
profile
create
Open
the
config
file
in
a
text
editor
","
If
you
are
the
kind
of
person
who
hasn't
messed
around
with
their
console
overly
much
and
installs
things
in
standard
places
","
you
can
skip
straight
to
this
step
by
typing
:
ipython
profile
create
followed
by
start
notepad
.
ipython\profile_default\ipython_config.py
.
Search
for
the
string
c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor
","
The
comment
above
this
indicates
you
can
also
use
the
EDITOR
environment
variable
","
but
hard
coding
file
paths
never
hurt
anyone
so
lets
do
eet
:
Copy
the
line
and
remove
the
leading
hash
and
spaces
from
the
copy
.
Replace
the
text
between
the
apostrophes
(
'
notepad
'
)
with
the
path
of
our
desired
editor
","
e.g
.
c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor
=
'
c
:
/
program
files
(
x86
)
/
noddyeditor
/
noddy.exe
'
There
is
a
catch
here
","
though
;
some
modern
editors
get
a
bit
fancy
and
automatically
and
","
when
invoked
like
this
","
detach
from
the
console
.
Notepad
+
+
and
Sublime
Text
","
for
example
.
Sublime
accepts
a
""""
-
-
wait
""""
option
","
which
works
some
of
the
time
;
this
tells
the
command
invocation
to
hang
around
until
you
close
the
file
","
for
some
definition
of
until
and
some
other
definition
of
close
.
However
","
the
following
setting
will
work
most
of
the
time
for
sublime
text
:
(
assuming
c:\program
files
\
is
where
your
sublime
text
3
directory
is
)
