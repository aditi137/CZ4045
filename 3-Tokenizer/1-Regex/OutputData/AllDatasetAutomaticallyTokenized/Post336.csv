Half
a
year
ago
I
took
over
a
large
web
application
(
fortunately
already
in
Python
)
which
had
some
major
architectural
deficiencies
(
templates
and
code
mixed
","
code
duplication
","
you
name
it
...
)
.
My
plan
is
to
eventually
have
the
system
respond
to
WSGI
","
but
I
am
not
there
yet
.
I
found
the
best
way
to
do
it
","
is
in
small
steps
.
Over
the
last
6
month
","
code
reuse
has
gone
up
and
progress
has
accelerated
.
General
principles
which
have
worked
for
me
:
Throw
away
code
which
is
not
used
or
commented
out
Throw
away
all
comments
which
are
not
useful
Define
a
layer
hierarchy
(
models
","
business
logic
","
view
/
controller
logic
","
display
logic
","
etc.
)
of
your
application
.
This
has
not
to
be
very
clear
cut
architecture
but
rather
should
help
you
think
about
the
various
parts
of
your
application
and
help
you
better
categorize
your
code
.
If
something
grossly
violates
this
hierarchy
","
change
the
offending
code
.
Move
the
code
around
","
recode
it
at
another
place
","
etc.
At
the
same
time
adjust
the
rest
of
your
application
to
use
this
code
instead
of
the
old
one
.
Throw
the
old
one
away
if
not
used
anymore
.
Keep
you
APIs
simple
!
Progress
can
be
painstakingly
slow
","
but
should
be
worth
it
.
