I
am
recently
into
session
and
cookies
.
I
comprehend
session
and
cookies
well
in
theory
but
i
have
one
issue
in
understanding
the
code
of
session
.
It
is
about
getting
the
last_visit
by
the
user
.
The
code
is
from
the
tangowithdjango.com
When
i
tried
to
understand
what
request.session.get('last_visit')
does
","
i
get
None
all
the
time
.
What
i
don't
understand
is
the
key
'
last_visit
'
.
Is
it
default
object
inside
session
?
If
it
is
default
in
the
session
object
then
why
it
shows
None
every
time
in
my
terminal
.
Please
someone
make
me
understand
the
object
passed
inside
get()
.
