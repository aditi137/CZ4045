I
know
this
is
a
bit
of
a
zombie
question
","
but
I
couldnt
find
a
relevant
newer
one
.
So
I'll
post
this
in
case
it
helps
someone
.
here's
an
algorithm
I've
used
.
It
relies
on
the
following
assumptions
:
its
a
square
/
rectangle
:
4
vertices
","
edges
at
90
degrees
to
each
other
vertices
are
already
in
sequence
(
either
clockwise
or
anti-clockwise
)
its
rotated
by
R
such
that
-
45
<
R
<
+
45
degrees
Note
:
it
uses
numpy
and
the
scikit-image
coordinate
convention
:
(
Y
","
X
)
with
(
0
","
0
)
in
the
top
left
corner
