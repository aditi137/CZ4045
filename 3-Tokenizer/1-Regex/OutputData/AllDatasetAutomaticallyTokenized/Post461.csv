I
know
this
is
an
old
question
","
but
these
days
I
would
recommend
using
a
service
such
as
Sentry
to
capture
your
errors
.
On
Django
","
the
steps
to
set
this
up
are
incredibly
simple
.
From
the
docs
:
Install
Raven
using
pip
install
raven
Add
'
raven.contrib.django.raven_compat
'
to
your
settings.INSTALLED_APPS
.
Add
RAVEN_CONFIG
=
{
""""
dsn
""""
:
YOUR_SENTRY_DSN
}
to
your
settings
.
Then
","
on
your
500
page
(
defined
in
handler500
)
","
pass
the
request.sentry.id
to
the
template
and
your
users
can
reference
the
specific
error
without
any
of
your
internals
being
exposed
.
