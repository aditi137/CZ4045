I
have
a
defaultdict(list)
and
I
used
simplejson.dums(my_defaultdict)
in
order
to
output
the
defaultdict
into
a
JSON
format
.
I
am
using
the
HTML
code
for
dendogram
from
http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063570
but
I
am
trying
to
make
my
defaultdict
information
into
the
format
of
the
JSON
file
the
author
is
using
.
This
JSON
file
is
named
:
/
mbostock
/
raw
/
4063550
/
flare.JSON
and
it's
found
in
this
link
:
http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/raw/4063550/flare.json.
So
here
is
my
defaultdict
data
:
so
my
current
json_data
looks
like
this
:
So
in
my
understanding
the
numbers
would
be
the
corresponding
""""
"name"":""5"
""""
and
then
my
JSON
format
file
would
also
have
the
children
as
""""
children
""""
.
As
what
it
is
right
now
","
my
JSON
format
output
doesn't
run
in
the
HTML
code
of
the
dendogram
.
Any
help
on
how
to
output
my
defaultdict
into
the
appropriate
JSON
format
that
would
work
with
the
HTML
code
for
producing
that
dendogram
would
be
great
.
The
code
has
to
be
Python
.
The
expected
outcome
would
be
like
this
:
Edited
:
The
answer
of
martineau
works
","
but
it's
not
exactly
what
I
want
.
I
start
with
a
defaultdict(list)
and
the
desired
output
","
as
above
should
have
the
""""
children
""""
as
a
list
of
dicts
whereas
with
martineau
kind
answer
","
the
""""
children
""""
it's
just
a
list
.
If
anybody
can
add
something
to
that
to
make
it
work
it
would
be
great
.
Don't
worry
about
the
""""
size
""""
variable
","
this
can
be
ignored
for
now
.
Thank
you
.
