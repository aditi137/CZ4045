I
just
got
through
the
Flask
mega-tutorial's
section
on
implementing
full
text
search
with
Flask-WhooshAlchemy
(
http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-x-full-text-search
)
and
I
have
the
posts
below
:
I
tried
using
Post.query.whoosh_search('fourth AND not')
.
all()
expecting
to
get
back
[
Post
u'not
my
fourth
'
]
as
a
result
but
I'm
getting
both
of
the
original
posts
instead
.
How
do
I
get
WhooshAlchemy
to
treat
the
not
as
a
string
rather
than
an
operator
?
