I
have
25
data
frames
which
I
need
to
merge
and
find
recurrently
occurring
rows
from
all
25
data
frames
","
For
example
","
my
data
frame
looks
like
following
","
And
In
the
end
","
I
am
aiming
to
have
an
output
data
frame
like
following
","
I
can
get
there
with
the
following
solution
","
By
dictionary
which
adds
all
these
three
data
frames
into
one
bigger
data
frame
dfs
dfs
=
{
'
df1
'
:
df1
","
'
df2
'
:
df2
}
Then
further
","
This
gives
out
the
resulting
data
frame
with
matching
rows
from
all
three
data
frames
","
but
I
have
25
data
frames
which
I
am
calling
as
list
from
the
directory
as
following
","
And
so
how
can
I
show
the
list
'
results
'
in
the
dictionary
and
proceed
further
to
get
the
desired
output
.
Any
help
or
suggestions
are
greatly
appreciated
.
Thank
you
