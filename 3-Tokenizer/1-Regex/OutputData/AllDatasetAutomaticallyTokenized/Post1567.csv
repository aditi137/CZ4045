I
run
into
this
problem
frequently
in
Python's
ggplot
when
working
with
multiple
stock
prices
and
economic
timeseries
.
The
key
to
remember
with
ggplot
is
that
data
is
best
organized
in
long
format
to
avoid
any
issues
.
I
use
a
quick
two
step
process
as
a
workaround
.
First
let's
grab
some
stock
data
:
First
understand
that
ggplot
needs
the
datetime
index
to
be
a
column
in
the
pandas
dataframe
in
order
to
plot
correctly
when
switching
from
wide
to
long
format
.
I
wrote
a
function
to
address
this
particular
point
.
It
simply
creates
a
'
Date
'
column
of
type=datetime
from
the
pandas
series
index
.
From
there
run
the
function
on
the
df
.
Use
the
result
as
the
object
in
pandas
pd.melt
using
the
'
Date
'
as
the
id_vars
.
The
returned
df
is
now
ready
to
be
plotted
using
the
standard
ggplot()
format
.
From
here
you
can
now
plot
your
data
however
you
want
.
A
common
plot
I
use
is
the
following
:
