Besides
changing
lines
18
and
19
you
need
to
make
sure
that
you
have
the
correct
IP
address
.
You
can
check
that
by
going
to
your
site
here
:
http://your.domain.tld/support/scp/logs.php
Then
look
to
see
if
you
get
the
error
API
Error
(
401
)
.
If
you
do
then
look
at
the
IP
address
and
create
a
new
API
key
for
that
IP
address
.
The
problem
I
was
facing
was
I
typed
in
my
IPv4
address
","
but
the
server
was
getting
my
IPv6
address
.
