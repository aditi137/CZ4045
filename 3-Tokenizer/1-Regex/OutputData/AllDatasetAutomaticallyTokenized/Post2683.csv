I'm
not
sure
the
best
way
to
explain
it
so
I
created
an
example
picture
and
made
up
some
data
:
I
looked
at
this
post
and
know
I
need
to
use
some
forloop
template
stuff
:
Displaying
a
Table
in
Django
from
Database
The
parts
that
are
throwing
me
off
are
how
to
have
a
table
within
a
table
.
For
example
","
the
doctor
'
Bob
""""
has
3
different
patients
.
Bob
has
one
row
but
Bob's
patient
column
has
3
rows
within
it
.
I'm
having
trouble
finding
an
example
like
this
to
work
off
of
and
am
not
sure
how
to
approach
it
.
I
also
need
those
patients
to
link
to
the
individual
patient
pages
.
So
if
I
click
on
Bob's
patient
'
C755
'
I
will
be
directed
to
that
patient's
page
.
I
was
thinking
something
like
:
Thanks
for
any
help
.
Just
not
sure
the
best
way
to
approach
this
.
