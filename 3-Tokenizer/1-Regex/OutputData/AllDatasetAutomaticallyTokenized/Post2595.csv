To
correct
way
to
get
a
list
of
tuples
using
list
comprehensions
would
be
:
You
can
of
course
replace
to_tuple()
with
a
lambda
function
","
I
just
wanted
to
make
the
example
clear
.
Moreover
","
you
could
use
map()
to
have
a
tuple
with
floats
instead
of
string
:
return
"tuple(map(float,coords_str.split(',')"
)
)
.
