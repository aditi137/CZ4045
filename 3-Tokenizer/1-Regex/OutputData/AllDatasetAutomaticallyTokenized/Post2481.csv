I
want
to
use
the
.
.
include
:
:
function
inline
","
but
I
can
only
get
it
to
actually
include
the
file
I
want
if
I
separate
it
with
two
new
lines
from
the
previous
text
.
Before
anyone
asks
","
the
file
I
want
to
include
is
a
protocol
number
","
so
no
","
it
doesn't
benefit
from
a
new
line
","
at
all
.
I
want
to
be
able
to
change
it
easily
so
I
can
use
it
on
multiple
places
of
my
documentation
.
I
guess
that
an
example
would
be
""""
We
currently
use
the
protocol
(
proto.txt
)
.
""""
I'm
new
to
Sphinx
and
rst
","
so
maybe
there
is
a
very
obvious
solution
I
haven't
found
.
