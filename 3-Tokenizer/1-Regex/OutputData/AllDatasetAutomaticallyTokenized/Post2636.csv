Well
","
here
is
a
way
to
do
it
in
basic
Python
:
Let's
create
data
consisting
of
items
from
each
columns
:
In
[163]
:
data
=
[
*
"zip(col1, col2, col3)"
]
Let's
use
itertools
module
to
group
them
up
:
Now
","
groups
is
a
generator
.
If
we
want
to
see
what
it
looks
like
we
will
need
to
iterate
it
:
and
we
get
:
But
we
exhausted
the
iterator
.
So
let's
create
it
again
","
and
now
that
we
know
what
it
contains
","
we
can
perform
the
desired
sorting
:
OK
","
one
more
thing
","
and
I
do
that
now
in
the
editor
:
And
we
get
:
