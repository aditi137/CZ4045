assertRaises
as
a
context
manager
:
Here
is
an
explanation
of
the
with
statement
.
Here
are
the
docs
.
TL;DR
:
It
allows
the
execution
of
a
code
block
with
a
""""
context
""""
","
i.e.
things
to
be
set
up
and
disposed
before
/
after
the
execution
","
error
handling
etc.
In
the
case
of
assertRaises
","
its
context
manager
simply
checks
whether
an
execption
of
the
required
type
has
been
raised
","
by
checking
the
exc
agrument
passed
to
its
__exit__
method
.
