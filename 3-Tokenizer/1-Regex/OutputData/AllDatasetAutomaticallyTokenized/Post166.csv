I
would
look
in
to
understanding
more
details
about
Python
syntax
.
Often
times
if
a
piece
of
code
looks
odd
","
there
usually
is
a
better
way
to
write
it
.
For
example
","
in
the
above
example
:
While
it
is
a
small
change
","
it
might
help
the
readability
.
Also
","
in
all
honesty
","
I've
never
used
a
while
loop
","
so
there
is
a
good
change
you
would
end
up
with
a
nice
concise
list
comprehension
or
for
loop
instead
.
