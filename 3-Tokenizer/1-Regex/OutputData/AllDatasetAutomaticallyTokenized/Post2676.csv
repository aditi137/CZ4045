In
python
I
have
2
three
dimensional
arrays
:
T
with
size
(
n
","
n
","
n
)
U
with
size
(
k
","
n
","
n
)
T
and
U
can
be
seen
as
many
2-D
arrays
one
next
to
the
other
.
I
need
to
multiply
all
those
matrices
","
ie
I
have
to
perform
the
following
operation
:
As
n
might
be
very
big
I
am
wondering
if
this
operation
could
be
in
some
way
speed
up
with
numpy
.
