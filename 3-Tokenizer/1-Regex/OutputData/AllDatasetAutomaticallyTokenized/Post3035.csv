I
am
working
with
python
selenium
web
driver.I
want
the
loop
through
the
table
for
the
text
inside
the
td
inside
tr
tag
like
thisBut
problem
here
is
the
class
name
is
always
changing
and
xpath
and
css_selector
is
also
changing.example
xpath
will
be
like
this
.
/
/
*
[
@id='P825048fc6b084257a601fde4805c8c33_1_oReportCell
'
]
/
table
/
tbody
/
tr
[2]
/
td
/
table
/
tbody
/
tr
/
td
/
table
/
tbody
/
tr
[3]
/
td
[8]
/
div
But
the
id
is
changing
always.so
couldn't
apply
driver.find_element_by_id()
.
I
think
regular
expressions
or
BeautifulSoup
can
be
used
to
solve
this.I
am
beginner
to
regex.So
is
there
any
way
this
could
be
solved
?
