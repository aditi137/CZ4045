I
am
currently
profiling
some
python
code
like
so
:
The
code
runs
successfuly
","
outputs
no
exception
.
However
my
restats.txt
looks
like
this
:
SomeFunc
(
i
i
gÇZ3a
/
­
?
gÇZ3a
/
­
?
0
(
s
;
C:\SomeFolder\bar.pyiL
t
Basically
it
is
150
lines
of
garbage
characters
with
random
paths
and
function
names
mixed
in
.
What
could
be
the
issue
?
Am
I
using
this
correctly
?
The
python
file
is
being
loaded
in
through
Maya
if
that
makes
a
differance
.
