Say
I
have
the
following
methods
:
In
methodA
I
wish
to
call
methodB
","
passing
on
the
kwargs
.
However
","
it
seems
that
if
I
define
methodA
as
follows
","
the
second
argument
will
be
passed
on
as
positional
rather
than
named
variable
arguments
.
How
do
I
make
sure
that
the
*
*
kwargs
in
methodA
gets
passed
as
*
*
kwargs
to
methodB
?
