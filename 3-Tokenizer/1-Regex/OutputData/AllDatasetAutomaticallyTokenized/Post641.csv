I
am
building
a
web
application
that
allows
a
user
to
upload
an
image
.
When
the
image
is
uploaded
","
it
needs
to
be
resized
to
one
or
more
sizes
","
each
of
which
needs
to
be
sent
to
Amazon
s3
for
storage
.
Metadata
and
urls
for
each
size
of
the
image
are
stored
in
a
single
database
record
on
the
web
server
.
I'm
using
a
message
queue
to
perform
the
resizing
and
uploading
asynchronously
(
as
there
is
potential
for
large
images
and
multiple
resizes
per
request
)
.
When
the
resize
/
upload
task
completes
","
the
database
record
needs
to
be
updated
with
the
url
.
My
problem
is
that
the
worker
executing
the
task
will
not
have
access
to
the
database
.
I
was
thinking
of
firing
off
a
http
callback
from
the
worker
back
to
the
web
application
after
the
task
is
complete
with
the
appropriate
information
for
updating
the
database
record
.
Are
there
any
other
alternatives
or
reasons
I
should
do
this
another
way
?
I'm
using
python
/
pylons
for
the
web
backend
","
mysql
for
the
database
and
celery
/
amqp
for
messaging
.
Thanks
!
