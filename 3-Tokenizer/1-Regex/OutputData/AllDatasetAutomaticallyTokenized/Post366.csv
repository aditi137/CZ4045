I've
been
working
with
wxPython
for
a
few
years
now
and
I
like
it
quite
a
bit
.
The
best
thing
about
wxPython
is
that
the
UI
feels
native
on
the
different
platforms
it
runs
on
(
excellent
on
Windows
and
Linux
though
not
as
good
on
OS
/
X
)
.
The
API
lacks
some
consistency
","
but
you
quickly
get
used
to
it
.
You
can
check
out
Testuff
(
shameless
plug
","
as
it's
my
own
product
)
to
get
a
feeling
of
what
can
be
done
with
wxPython
(
although
I
must
say
","
with
quite
a
bit
of
effort
)
.
