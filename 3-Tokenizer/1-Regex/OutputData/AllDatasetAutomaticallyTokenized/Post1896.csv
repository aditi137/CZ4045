After
calling
do_every
-
it
runs
the
worker_func
once
and
then
continues
.
yes
.
So
your
output
will
be
:
1
)
I
didn't
really
know
if
the
timer
would
be
messed
up
-
so
I
ran
a
test
using
htop
where
I
can
send
SIGCONT
and
SIGSTOP
to
any
process
-
so
","
I
ran
do_every
(
2
","
print_so
","
10
)
;
and
after
5-6
""""
"stackoverflow""s"
I
stopped
it
.
After
a
minute
on
starting
it
-
it
spewed
out
4
more
stackoverflows
.
So
","
no
-
the
timer
is
not
messed
up
.
3
)
It
will
not
be
messed
up
-
what
will
happen
is
that
if
the
socket
has
a
timeout
-
and
you
pause
for
more
than
the
timeout
","
the
other
side
of
the
socket
will
assume
your
code
is
dead
and
will
give
a
timeout
exception
.
But
if
it's
for
less
than
the
timeout
","
the
socket
will
assume
it
was
a
temporary
disconnection
","
and
will
continue
streaming
the
data
after
that
.
