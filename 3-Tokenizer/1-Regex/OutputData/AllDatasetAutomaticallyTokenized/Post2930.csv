Adding
end
=
'
'
to
your
first
print
statement
should
fix
the
problem
.
By
specifying
that
the
end
character
is
an
empty
string
you
will
override
the
default
\
n
character
(
by
default
print
statements
end
with
a
new
line
character
)
.
We
will
only
add
end
=
'
'
to
the
first
print
statement
because
we
want
the
new
line
to
print
after
you
print
out
the
location
.
If
you
want
to
separate
your
prints
with
a
","
of
course
you
would
just
add
+
'
","
'
to
your
first
print
statement
.
This
will
work
right
off
the
bat
if
you're
using
Python
3
.
If
you're
using
Python
2.X
you
will
have
to
add
this
line
to
the
top
of
your
file
:
from
__future__
import print_function
Here's
a
simple
example
of
this
in
action
:
If
we
took
the
same
code
but
altered
it
slightly
and
just
removed
the
end
=
'
'
","
this
is
what
would
happen
:
As
you
can
see
each
line
would
end
with
a
new
line
character
","
this
printing
a
new
line
for
each
statement
.
