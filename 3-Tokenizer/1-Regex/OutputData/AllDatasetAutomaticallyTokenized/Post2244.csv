You
have
to
create
a
thread
in
the
background
.
Different
threads
may
run
at
one
time
.
Dialog
box
stops
current
thread
and
waits
while
user
make
a
choice
.
This
is
normal
behavior
.
Python
has
very
easy
threading
API
.
Thread
is
function
that
is
passed
as
an
argument
to
a
thread
class
constructor
.
Thread
executes
this
function
then
","
and
you
may
start
several
threads
","
they
will
not
lock
the
current
thread
.
Move
your
dialog
or
background
code
to
a
separate
thread
.

a
Python

.
Well
","
there
are
several
techniques

but
they
require
C
