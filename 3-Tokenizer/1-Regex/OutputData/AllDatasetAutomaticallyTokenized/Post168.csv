Rather
than
focusing
on
making
your
existing
structures
more
readable
","
you
should
focus
on
making
more
logical
structures
.
Make
smaller
blocks
","
try
not
to
nest
blocks
excessively
","
make
smaller
functions
","
and
try
to
think
through
your
code
flow
more
.
If
you
come
to
a
point
where
you
can't
quickly
determine
the
structure
of
your
code
","
you
should
probably
consider
refactoring
and
adding
some
comments
.
Code
flow
should
always
be
immediately
apparent
-
-
the
more
you
have
to
think
about
it
","
the
less
maintainable
your
code
becomes
.
