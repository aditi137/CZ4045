I
am
building
a
small
micro-web
application
using
bottle
.
First
step
is
that
the
user
inputs
an
ID
into
a
form
in
order
to
retrieve
a
record
.
Once
the
ID
has
been
verified
as
part
of
the
SQLite
database
further
steps
will
be
taken
","
they
can
modify
records
","
add
data
to
another
.
db
with
the
same
PRIMARY
KEY
and
so
on
and
so
forth
.
My
question
is
","
within
the
session
how
do
I
preserve
the
ID
once
verified
and
pass
it
around
the
various
functions
.
Should
it
be
a
global
created
inside
the
function
that
verifies
the
user
input
?
I
am
wary
of
globals
","
just
because
so
much
junk
is
talked
about
them
.
Also
","
I
am
nervous
that
if
not
very
well
managed
the
user
could
restart
the
session
enter
new
data
but
the
global
ID
variable
might
not
have
been
properly
disposed
of
etc....
What
is
the
correct
way
to
approach
this
?
Im
not
sure
it
helps
","
but
here
is
the
code
I
am
using
so
far
....
