I
am
trying
to
parse
a
large
xml
file
and
print
the
tags
to
an
output
file
.
I
am
using
minidom
","
my
code
is
working
fine
for
30Mb
files
but
for
larger
ones
it
is
getting
memory
error
.
So
I
used
bufferred
reading
the
on
file
but
now
I
am
unable
to
get
the
desired
output
.
XML
File
Desired
Output
Sony
","
Burger
","
Apple
Samsung
","
Pizza
","
HTC
Bravia
","
Pasta
","
BlackBerry
When
reading
with
buffer
its
giving
me
an
output
saying
:
-
Sony
","
Burger
","
Apple
Samsung
","
Piz
Bravia
","
Pasta
","
BlackBerry
I
tried
with
seek()
but
still
I
was
unable
to
get
the
desired
output
.
