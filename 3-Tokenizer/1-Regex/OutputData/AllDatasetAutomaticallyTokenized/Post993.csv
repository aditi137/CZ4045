I'm
considering
several
options
for
the
user
interface
of
an
application
.
I
want
this
application
to
be
multi-platform
(
Windows
","
Linux
","
OSX
)
","
so
one
of
the
options
I
considered
was
to
develop
it
as
a
web
application
","
but
run
it
on
a
local
server
to
still
have
access
to
administrator
privileges
(
which
are
required
)
.
simply
","
a
web
interface
to
my
program
.
I
want
to
develop
in
python
for
convenience
reasons
.
Does
using
Pylons
for
this
job
is
recommended
and
if
so
","
what
is
the
best
way
to
run
it
in
this
setup
?
