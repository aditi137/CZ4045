Assume
that
I
have
the
following
data
How
do
I
find
all
indices
where
","
say
","
date_list
=
=
"datetime.datetime(2015, 3, 31)"
?
This
should
be
an
easy
problem
","
but
I
can't
seem
to
figure
it
out

Thanks

we
take
a
simple
example
and
set
numids
to
1
and
the
date
of
interest
to
be
"datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 1)"
","
I
would
like
to
get
the
index
1

a
list
[
True
","
False
","
False
","
...
","
False
]
.
Edit

Now
","
I
try
to
just
loop
through
the
array
and
calculate
the
difference
in
days
","
such
as
However
","
this
gives
me
an
error
that
I've
never
seen
