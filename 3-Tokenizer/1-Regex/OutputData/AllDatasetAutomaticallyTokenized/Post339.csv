A
good
place
to
begin
if
you're
considering
the
move
to
Python
is
to
rewrite
your
administrator
interface
in
Django
.
This
will
help
you
get
some
of
the
kinks
worked
out
in
terms
of
getting
Python
up
and
running
with
IIS
(
or
to
migrate
it
to
Apache
)
.
Speaking
of
which
","
I
recommend
isapi-wsgi
.
It's
by
far
the
easiest
way
to
get
up
and
running
with
IIS
.
