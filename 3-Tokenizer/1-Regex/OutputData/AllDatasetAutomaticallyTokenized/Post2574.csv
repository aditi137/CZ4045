In
the
mapping
used
by
the
Collatz
conjecture
","
a
positive
value
always
maps
to
another
positive
value
.
So
you
only
need
to
check
for
negative
values
as
part
of
your
initialisation
:
The
loop
while
not
number
!
=
1
:
can
be
deleted
.
It
will
only
run
if
number
is
equal
to
1
(
there
is
a
double
negative
)
.
If
you
enter
1
","
this
loop
will
run
once
","
assign
3*1+1
to
number
","
and
then
the
second
loop
will
start
.
In
other
words
","
this
loop
is
pointless
:
delete
it
.
Note
the
line
number
*
*
2
will
not
change
the
value
of
number
","
since
there
is
no
assignment
.
