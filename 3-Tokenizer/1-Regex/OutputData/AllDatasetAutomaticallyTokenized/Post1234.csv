In
os
there's
a
function
os.path.islink(PATH)
which
checks
if
PATH
is
symlink
.
But
if
fails
when
PATH
is
a
symlink
to
some
directory
.
Instead
-
-
python
thinks
it
is
directory
(
os.path.isdir(PATH)
)
.
So
how
do
I
check
if
a
dir
is
link
?
Edit
:
Here's
what
bash
thinks
:
and
here's
what
python
thinks
:
