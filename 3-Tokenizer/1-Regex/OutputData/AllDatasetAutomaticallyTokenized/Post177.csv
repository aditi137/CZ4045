I
don't
think
that
your
results
are
all
that
surprising
-
-
if
anything
it
is
that
Postgres
is
so
fast
.
Does
the
Postgres
query
run
faster
a
second
time
once
it
has
had
a
chance
to
cache
the
data
?
To
be
a
little
fairer
your
test
for
Java
and
Python
should
cover
the
cost
of
acquiring
the
data
in
the
first
place
(
ideally
loading
it
off
disk
)
.
If
this
performance
level
is
a
problem
for
your
application
in
practice
but
you
need
a
RDBMS
for
other
reasons
then
you
could
look
at
memcached
.
You
would
then
have
faster
cached
access
to
raw
data
and
could
do
the
calculations
in
code
.
