For
a
square
matrix
","
each
cell
is
either
black
(
1
)
or
white
(
0
)
","
trying
to
find
the
max
sub-square
whose
border
is
black
.
Here
is
my
code
with
Python
2.7
","
wondering
if
logically
correct
?
And
any
performance
improvements
?
Thanks
.
My
major
ideas
is
","
keep
track
of
how
many
black
nodes
are
on
top
(
continuously
)
and
on
left
(
continuously
)
","
which
is
left
and
top
matrix
represents
.
Then
","
based
on
the
left
and
top
tracking
","
for
any
node
","
I
will
try
to
find
minimal
value
of
top
and
left
continuous
black
node
","
then
I
will
base
the
minimal
value
to
see
if
a
square
could
be
formed
.
