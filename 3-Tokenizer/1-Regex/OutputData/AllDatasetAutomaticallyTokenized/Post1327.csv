I
have
a
wrapper
to
redirect
outputs
when
I
call
python
python-wrapped
C
+
+
.
The
basic
idea
is
to
use
dup
and
dup2
","
which
are
the
only
ways
I've
been
able
to
catch
the
printf
outputs
from
the
C
+
+
.
The
wrapper
works
fine
with
no
calls
to
flush()
as
long
as
I'm
running
the
job
interactively
","
but
when
I
send
the
job
to
a
TORQUE
batch
I
get
the
unwelcome
outputs
again
.
My
understanding
","
in
part
from
this
question
","
is
that
some
well-placed
flush()
calls
should
fix
this
","
but
where
exactly
do
they
need
to
go
?
Should
I
flush
the
buffer
before
dup'ing
to
the
tempfile
?
Before
dup'ing
back
?
Both
?
The
wrapper
I'm
using
is
as
follows
:
