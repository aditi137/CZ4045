Short
answer
:
use
time.clock()
for
timing
in
Python
.
On
*
nix
systems
","
clock()
returns
the
processor
time
as
a
floating
point
number
","
expressed
in
seconds
.
On
Windows
","
it
returns
the
seconds
elapsed
since
the
first
call
to
this
function
","
as
a
floating
point
number
.
time()
returns
the
the
seconds
since
the
epoch
","
in
UTC
","
as
a
floating
point
number
.
There
is
no
guarantee
that
you
will
get
a
better
precision
that
1
second
(
even
though
time()
returns
a
floating
point
number
)
.
Also
note
that
if
the
system
clock
has
been
set
back
between
two
calls
to
this
function
","
the
second
function
call
will
return
a
lower
value
.
