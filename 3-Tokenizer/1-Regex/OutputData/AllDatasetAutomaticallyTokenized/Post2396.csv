Hashing
is
what
makes
the
set
efficient
.
If
you
can't
hash
","
then
you
can't
take
advantage
of
that
efficiency
-
you
have
to
compare
every
object
with
every
other
object
and
you
get
an
O(nÂ²)
algorithm
instead
of
an
amortized
O(n)
one
.
However
","
if
you
care
only
about
object
identity
and
not
equality
","
then
you
can
make
dicts
mapping
the
object
ids
to
the
objects
","
and
take
the
intersection
of
the
ids
:
If
you
want
a
more
code-efficient
solution
or
you
do
care
about
object
equality
","
then
@Neil's
answer
should
suffice
.
