The
wrapper
library
you
seem
to
be
using
","
suggest
an
alternative
method
to
capture
frames
(
your
GetVideo
only
takes
single
frames
","
it
does
NOT
return
a
time-series
of
images
","
so
it's
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
)
:
Remark
that
it
starts
and
stops
the
acquisition
each
time
.
By
inspecting
the
stop_acquisition
method
","
you
will
notice
that
it
redirects
that
call
to
the
Aravis
library
","
where
most
likely
the
memory
buffers
are
correctly
torn-down
.
In
your
current
implementation
","
you
will
probably
notice
that
each
time
you
call
GetVideo
","
the
memory
increases
by
about
the
same
amount
as
the
size
(
in
MB
)
of
a
single
image
.
It
is
my
guess
that
by
using
some
of
the
more
specific
methods
available
to
cap.cam
(
an
instance
of
the
Aravis.Camera
)
","
you
will
be
able
to
set
up
a
""""
ring
""""
structure
","
which
is
typical
for
streaming
video
.
However
","
if
you
just
want
snapshots
","
then
use
the
code
above
.
