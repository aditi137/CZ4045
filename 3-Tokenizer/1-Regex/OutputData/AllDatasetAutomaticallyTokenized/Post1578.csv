My
guess
is
that
you
get
this
error
message
at
the
if
resp
[0]
=
=
correctResp
:
line
:
Is
that
true
?
If
yes
","
it
is
simply
because
event.getKeys()
returns
an
empty
list
[]
if
no
responses
were
collected
.
And
doing
[]
[0]
will
give
you
the
above
error
because
there's
no
first
element
(
index
zero
)
just
like
"[1,2,3,4]"
[1000]
will
give
you
the
same
error
.
Note
that
even
if
you
press
a
lot
of
keys
and
none
of
them
are
in
the
keyList
","
getKeys
will
return
an
empty
list
because
it
ignores
everything
but
the
contents
of
the
keyList
(
unless
you
set
keyList=None
","
in
which
case
it
accepts
all
keys
)
.
There's
a
few
simple
ways
out
of
this
.
Firstly
","
you
can
simply
check
whether
resp
is
empty
and
give
a
""""
fail
""""
score
if
it
is
and
only
check
for
correctness
if
it
is
not
.
A
more
general
solution
","
which
would
work
with
many
response
keys
and
scoring
criteria
","
is
to
do
if
correctResp
in
resp
and
then
score
as
a
success
if
yes
.
This
comparison
will
work
with
an
empty
list
as
well
","
in
which
case
it
always
returns
False
as
empty
lists
per
definition
can't
contain
anything
.
But
in
your
particular
case
","
you
only
have
one
response
option
so
it
is
even
simpler
!
Since
you've
""""
filtered
""""
responses
sing
the
keyList
","
you
KNOW
that
if
resp
is
[]
","
the
subject
answered
""""
no-go
""""
and
conversely
if
resp
is
not
[]
","
he
/
she
answered
""""
go
""""
.
So
:
Actually
","
I
suspect
that
you
also
want
to
give
feedback
in
trials
without
neutral
images
.
In
that
case
","
define
correct
as
bool(resp)
is
(
im
in
im_n
)
:
