The
reason
you're
getting
infinite
recursion
is
because
you're
telling
Python
to
store
the
result
of
the
recursive
call
rec('a')
in
the
dictionary
.
This
means
it
recurses
unconditionally
","
since
you
always
build
the
dictionary
before
doing
the
lookup
.
One
way
to
solve
this
would
be
to
store
lambda
functions
in
the
dictionary
","
and
then
only
call
the
one
you
get
.
In
this
version
","
the
recursive
call
is
only
made
when
the
appropriate
x
value
is
passed
in
:
Unfortunately
","
that's
a
bit
cumbersome
.
I'm
not
sure
I'd
bother
if
there
were
just
have
three
cases
and
a
default
.
I'd
just
use
a
series
of
if
statements
","
even
though
that
might
not
be
as
efficient
as
a
dictionary
lookup
.
