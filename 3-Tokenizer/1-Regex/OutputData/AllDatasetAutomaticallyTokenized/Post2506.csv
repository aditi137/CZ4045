I
have
been
working
on
a
personal
""""
how-to
""""
guide
","
chronicling
and
keeping
a
journal
of
my
studies
as
I
go
along
.
I
now
have
a
","
almost
too
long
block
of
code
that
","
when
I've
encountered
this
length
of
code
myself
","
its
always
frustrating
trying
to
highlight
JUST
the
block
without
it
highlighting
the
whole
page
","
or
not
enough
.
So
","
my
question
is
","
for
rst
(
reStructuredText
)
.
.
code-block::'s
","
is
there
an
add-on
or
a
way
to
add
in
a
copy
button
","
for
automatic
highlighting
or
automatically
adding
the
text
to
the
users
clipboard
?
Or
would
this
be
a
more
html-literal
type
of
code
I'd
have
to
include
in
the
build
and
reference
it
in
the
code
block
?
If
so
","
what
would
something
like
that
look
like
as
well
?
