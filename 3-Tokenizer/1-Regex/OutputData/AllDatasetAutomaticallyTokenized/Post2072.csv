If
I
have
a
string
like
this
:
how
would
I
take
out
the
""""
12345
""""
and
the
""""
67891
""""
","
etc
(
the
characters
between
the
pipes
)
and
add
them
to
a
list
all
the
way
until
the
question
mark
(
I
am
using
the
question
mark
in
my
code
as
a
terminating
character
)
?
A
similar
question
has
been
asked
here
:
How
do
I
find
the
string
between
two
special
characters
?
but
I
think
mine
is
different
because
I
need
to
do
it
multiple
times
in
the
same
","
one-line
string
.
Here
is
what
I
am
hoping
to
achieve
:
Thanks
in
advance
!
