Im
trying
to
make
a
regular
expression
in
python
that
allows
me
to
find
a
word
within
a
string
""""
n
""""
times
For
example
","
if
i
wanted
to
find
a
expression
that
could
match
if
the
word
""""
cat
""""
is
exactly
two
times
.
How
i
would
do
that
?
It
should
accept
""""
The
blue
cat
talks
to
the
red
cat
in
the
tree
""""
.
Because
it
has
""""
cat
""""
exactly
two
times
.
But
it
should
not
accept
""""
The
cat
is
big
""""
.
Because
it
has
""""
cat
""""
only
once
And
it
should
not
accept
either
""""
the
dog
is
yellow
""""
.
For
similar
reasons
Thanks
a
lot
EDIT
Hey
guys
Sorry
for
complicating
the
problem
too
much
","
but
i
forgot
to
mention
one
thing
.
If
i
wanted
to
find
""""
cat
""""
exactly
two
times
","
""""
The
catcat
runs
""""
would
also
match
