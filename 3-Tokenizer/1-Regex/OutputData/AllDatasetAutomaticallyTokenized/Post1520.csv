I
think
it
has
to
do
with
how
pymunk
tries
to
find
the
path
of
chipmunk.dll
when
frozen
.
Apparently
special
code
is
required
when
it
all
packs
into
one
file
.
Can
you
replace
your
libload.py
file
with
this
one
and
try
again
:

(
At
the
moment
I
cannot
try
this
myself
","
therefor
the
gist
.
If
it
works
Ill
commit
it
to
the
real
pymunk
repo
)
