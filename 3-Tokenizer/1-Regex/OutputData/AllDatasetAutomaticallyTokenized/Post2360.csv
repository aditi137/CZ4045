I
am
trying
to
find
the
averages
of
some
elements
in
a
nested
list
.
I
need
to
calculate
the
average
of
the
numbers
in
each
sub-list
and
order
the
sub-lists
in
descending
order
of
the
calculated
averages
in
Python
3
.
How
do
I
output
the
list
with
the
names
and
their
averages
next
to
them
?
I
have
tried
the
avg
function
but
got
stuck
.
