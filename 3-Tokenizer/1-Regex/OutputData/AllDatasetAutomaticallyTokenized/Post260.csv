Given
the
increasing
focus
to
running
dynamic
languages
(
da-vinci
vm
etc.
)
on
the
JVM
and
the
increasing
number
of
dynamic
languages
that
do
run
on
it
(
JRuby
","
Grrovy
","
Jython
)
I
think
the
usecases
are
just
increasing
.
Some
of
the
scenarios
I
found
really
benifited
are
Prototyping
-
use
RoR
or
Grails
to
build
quick
prototypes
with
advantage
of
being
able
to
runn
it
on
the
standard
app
server
and
(
maybe
)
reuse
existing
services
etc.
Testing
-
right
unit
tests
much
much
faster
in
dynamic
languages
Performance
/
automation
test
scripting
-
some
of
these
tools
are
starting
to
allow
the
use
standard
dynamic
language
of
choice
to
write
the
test
scripts
instead
of
proprietary
script
languages
.
Side
benefit
might
be
to
the
able
to
reuse
some
unit
test
code
you've
already
written
.
