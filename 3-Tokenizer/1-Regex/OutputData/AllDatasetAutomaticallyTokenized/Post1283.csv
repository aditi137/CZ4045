I
am
trying
to
learn
currying
in
Python
for
my
class
and
I
have
to
overload
the
(
)
operator
for
it
.
However
","
I
do
not
understand
how
can
I
can
go
about
overloading
the
(
)
operator
.
Can
you
explain
the
logic
behind
overloading
the
parentheses
?
Should
I
overload
first
(
and
then
)
or
can
I
do
any
of
these
?
Also
","
is
there
special
name
for
parentheses
operator
?
