You
might
have
used
SessionAuthentication
and
session
auth
checks
for
the
csrf_token
always
and
you
can
avoid
the
checks
by
exempting
but
Lets
not
do
that
.
I
think
you
can
keep
both
Authentication
classes
.
or
just
TokenAuthentication
.
ie
","
And
If
you
are
not
going
for
TokenAuth
and
just
the
session
Auth
.
you
can
always
pass
csrf_token
via
X-CSRFToken
header
.
Or
you
just
can
go
for
csrf_except
things
.
which
will
avoid
the
csrf
missing
issues
.
This
should
work
.
