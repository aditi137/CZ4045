I
â€˜ve
written
a
function
to
plot
the
histogram
for
an
1-D
array
theta
.
But
one
thing
I
do
not
like
in
this
function
is
that
the
data
is
in
the
code
.
Could
you
know
how
to
keep
the
data
in
a
file
and
to
make
the
function
read
them
from
the
file
?
Since
the
data
is
usually
much
larger
.
PS
:
The
code
is
