This
seems
like
a
really
simple
question
but
I
can't
find
a
good
answer
anywhere
.
How
might
I
multiply
(
in
place
)

columns

selected
by
a
list
)

a
scalar

numpy
?
E.g

columns
0
and
2
by

this
in
multiple
steps
but
I
feel
like
there
must
be
a
better
way
especially
if
the
list
gets
larger
.
Current
way
