Another
way
to
do
it
is
to
use
urllib2
module
to
parse
some
other
page's
whois
service
(
many
sites
like
that
exist
)
.
But
that
seems
like
even
more
of
a
hack
that
what
you
do
now
","
and
would
give
you
a
dependency
on
whatever
whois
site
you
chose
","
which
is
bad
.
I
hate
to
say
it
","
but
unless
you
want
to
re-implement
whois
in
your
program
(
which
would
be
re-inventing
the
wheel
)
","
running
whois
on
the
OS
and
parsing
the
output
(
ie
what
you
are
doing
now
)
seems
like
the
right
way
to
do
it
.
