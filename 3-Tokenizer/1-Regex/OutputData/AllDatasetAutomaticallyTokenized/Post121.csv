I
have
scripts
calling
other
script
files
but
I
need
to
get
the
filepath
of
the
file
that
is
currently
running
within
the
process
.
For
example
","
let's
say
I
have
three
files
.
Using
execfile
:
script_1.py
calls
script_2.py
.
In
turn
","
script_2.py
calls
script_3.py
.
How
can
I
get
the
file
name
and
path
of
script_3.py
","
from
code
within
script_3.py
","
without
having
to
pass
that
information
as
arguments
from
script_2.py
?
(
Executing
os.getcwd()
returns
the
original
starting
script's
filepath
not
the
current
file's
.
)
