My
setup
looks
like
this
:
A
64-bit
box
running
Windows
7
Professional
is
connected
to
a
Beaglebone
running
Angstrom
Linux
.
I'm
currently
controlling
the
beaglebone
via
a
putty
command
line
on
the
windows
box
.
What
I'd
like
to
do
is
run
an
OpenCV
script
to
pull
some
vision
information
","
process
it
on
the
windows
box
","
and
send
some
lightweight
data
(
e.g
a
True
or
False
","
a
triplet
","
etc.
)
over
the
(
or
another
)
USB
connection
to
the
beaglebone
.
My
OpenCV
program
is
running
using
Python
bindings
","
so
any
piping
I
can
do
with
python
would
be
preferable
.
I've
played
around
with
pyserial
to
receive
data
on
a
windows
box
via
a
COM
port
","
so
it
seems
like
I
could
use
that
on
the
windows
side
...
at
a
total
loss
though
on
the
embedded
linux
front
