My
command
line
script
takes
several
arguments
including
strings
","
ints
","
floats
and
lists
","
and
it
is
becoming
a
bit
tricky
to
do
the
call
with
all
arguments
:
To
avoid
having
to
write
all
arguments
in
the
command
line
I
have
created
a
text
file
with
all
arguments
which
I
simply
read
line
by
line
to
collect
arguments
.
This
is
working
fine
","
but
is
this
the
best
practice
for
doing
this
?
Are
there
a
more
effective
way
?
