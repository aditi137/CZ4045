I
don't
know
if
this
is
better
but
it
is
like
Raymond
Hettinger's
solution
but
the
priority
is
determined
from
the
object
.
Let
this
be
your
object
and
you
want
to
sort
by
the
the
x
attribute
.
Then
have
a
function
which
applies
the
pairing
Then
apply
the
function
to
the
lists
as
input
into
heapq.merge
Which
gave
me
the
following
output
