I
am
new
to
chi
squared
testing
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
'
standard
'
way
of
running
a
chi-squared
test
and
also
getting
a
95
%
confidence
interval
on
the
difference
between
success
rates
in
two
experiments
.
My
data
looks
like
this
:
These
numbers
represent
the
counts
of
what
was
observed
during
an
experiment
.
As
you
can
see
","
the
number
of
samples
for
Condition
A
vs
.
Condition
B
were
not
the
same
.
What
I'd
like
to
get
is
:
A
test
statistic
indicating
whether
Condition
A's
success
rate
of
33
%
is
statistically
different
from
Condition
B's
success
rate
of
50
%
.
I'd
also
like
to
get
a
95
%
confidence
interval
on
the
difference
between
the
two
success
rates
.
It
seems
like
scipy.stats.chisquare
expects
the
user
to
adjust
the
'
expected
'
counts
so
that
they
appear
to
be
taken
out
of
the
same
sample
size
as
the
'
observed
'
counts
.
Is
that
the
only
transformation
I
need
to
do
?
If
not
","
what
else
do
I
need
to
do
?
Finally
","
how
would
I
go
about
calculating
the
95
%
confidence
interval
for
the
difference
in
proportions
?
