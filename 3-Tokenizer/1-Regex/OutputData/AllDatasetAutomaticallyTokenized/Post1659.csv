Hello
all
…
I
am
using
Python
to
try
to
simulate
login
my
work
email
","
web
base
.
Now
a
problem
lies
on
the
first
page
of
login
.
I
observe
the
login
process
through
IE9’s
F12
(
Developer
tool
)
and
found
there
are
in
total
3
cookies
generated
.
However
when
I
use
below
scripts
to
visit
the
first
page
of
login
","
there
are
only
2
cookies
found
.
How
could
this
be
?
How
can
I
have
all
the
cookies
retrieved
?
(
I’ve
cleared
all
the
cache
","
cookie
history
","
and
empty
the
fold
of
Temporary
Internet
Files
before
catching
)
Thanks
.
