Task
I
want
to
install
Scipy
on
64bit
python
.
Already
Done
I
have
tried
following
ways
:
Using
pip
install
numpy
/
scipy
-
-
in
this
case
numpy
installs
well
but
scipy
fails
.
error
:
can't
find
lpack
.
.
Install
Scipy
from
here
-
-
in
this
it
installs
well
but
on
importing
gives
an
error
not
valid
win32
application
.
As
its
32bit
and
python
is
64bit
Use
gohlke
to
install
scipy
.
Installation
goes
well
but
when
importing
any
sub-module
like
import scipy
.
stats
throws
an
error
:
specified
module
can
not
be
found
.
Reason
to
move
on
64bit
Python
I
have
40000
data
points
csv
file
.
On
ruining
linkage
function
python
throws
a
memory
error
.
Some
posts
suggested
to
move
to
64bit
can
solve
the
issue
.
