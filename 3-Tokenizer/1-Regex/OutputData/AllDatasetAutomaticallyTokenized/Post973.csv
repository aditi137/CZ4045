can
someone
please
give
me
an
example
of
how
to
change
the
SORL-thumbnail
format
in
the
django
template
tag
.
I've
read
the
documentation
here
:
http://thumbnail.sorl.net/template.html#thumbnail
and
have
tried
various
ways
of
implimenting
to
no
avail
.
I
get
errors
similar
to
:
'
thumbnail
'
tag
received
a
bad
argument
:
'
format
'
My
code
works
fine
without
the
""""
"format=""png"
""""
""""
part
","
it
just
makes
a
jpg
thumbnail
.
However
","
I
want
a
png
thumbnail
.
{
%
thumbnail
product.main_image.picture
84x84
"format=""png"
""""
as
image
%
}
Also
","
adding
THUMBNAIL_FORMAT
=
""""
PNG
""""
to
my
settings.py
did
nothing
Thanks
","
UPDATE
:
HERE's
HOW
I
FIXED
THE
PROBLEM
:
So
Issac
and
zachwood
were
right
on
.
This
was
a
version
dependent
thing
.
I
resolved
my
problem
this
way
:
1
.
)
upgrade
to
newest
sorl
1.1
)
syncdb
2
.
)
in
settings
","
changed
THUMBNAIL_DEBUG
=
True
3
.
)
added
closing
tag
so
the
templates
looked
like
:
It
worked
