For
linux
and
Window
:
Just
modify
1
line
","
and
you
can
change
it
.
cwp.py
in
C:\Users
\
[
your
computer
name
]
\
Anaconda2
.
os.chdir(documents_folder)
at
the
end
of
the
file
.
Change
it
to
"os.chdir(""your expected working folder"")"
for
example
:
"os.chdir(""D:/Jupyter_folder"")"
It
worked
.
Update
:
When
it
comes
to
MacOS
","
I
couldnt
find
the
cwp.py
.
Here
is
what
I
found
:
Open
terminal
on
your
Macbook
","
run
'
jupyter
notebook
-
-
generate-config
'
.
It
will
create
a
config
file
at
\
Users\catbuilts\.jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config
.
Open
the
config
file
","
then
change
this
line
#
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir
=
'
'
(
search
for
the
word
'
_dir
'
)
to
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir
=
'
your
path
'
and
remember
un-comment
this
line
too
.
For
example
","
mine
is
'
/
Users
/
catbuilts
/
Jupyter_Projects
/
'
