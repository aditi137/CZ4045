models.py
When
I
create
a
Section
in
the
Admin
it
doesn't
appear
to
save
the
document_type_s
.
In
the
django
shell
I
can
see
that
DocumentType
is
saving
properly
:
When
I
check
the
Sections
I
get
:
And
when
I
check
Documents
:
And
if
I
try
to
create
a
new
section
:
Django
appears
to
have
created
the
field
in
the
database
","
looking
at
my
migrations
file
:
I
don't
know
what
is
causing
this
?
