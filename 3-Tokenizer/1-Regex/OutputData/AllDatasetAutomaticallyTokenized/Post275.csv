When
I
first
learned
Python
","
I
worked
for
a
Java
shop
.
Occasionally
I'd
have
to
do
serious
text-processing
tasks
which
were
much
easier
to
do
with
quick
Python
scripts
than
Java
programs
.
For
example
","
if
I
had
to
parse
a
complex
CSV
file
and
figure
out
which
of
its
rows
corresponded
to
rows
in
our
Oracle
database
","
this
was
much
easier
to
do
with
Python
than
Java
.
More
than
that
","
I
found
that
learning
Python
made
me
a
much
better
Java
programmer
;
having
learned
many
of
the
same
concepts
in
another
language
I
feel
that
I
understand
those
concepts
much
better
.
And
as
for
what
makes
Python
easier
than
Java
","
you
might

out
this
question
:
Java
->
Python
?
