Here's
one
unstable
way
to
do
it
:
If
stable
sort
is
required
you
could
leverage
enumerate
:
Above
generates
tuples
where
second
item
is
a
string
from
l2
and
first
item
is
the
count
of
matches
from
l1
:
Then
those
tuples
are
sorted
to
descending
order
:
And
finally
only
the
strings
are
taken
:
In
the
second
version
tuples
have
reverse
index
to
ensure
stability
:
