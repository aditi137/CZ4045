I
made
a
few
changes
to
your
code
.
First
I
used
get()
to
fetch
the
parameters
so
you
don't
need
to
use
the
if
in
request.GET
.
Next
I
made
use
of
chaining
QuerySet
filters
.
Finally
","
I
have
it
returning
both
q1
and
q2
to
the
template
.
It
doesn't
make
sense
to
only
return
a
query
when
you
can
enter
both
.
