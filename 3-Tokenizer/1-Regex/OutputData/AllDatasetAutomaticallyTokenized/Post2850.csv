Currently
","
I
am
trying
to
make
my
own
custom
legend
handler
by
creating
a
proxy
artist
(
?
)
patch
using
PatchCollections
and
then
following
http://matplotlib.org/users/legend_guide.html
to
make
a
custom
handler
.
However
I
am
running
into
a
roadblock
in
trying
to
implement
this
into
the
legend
.
The
arguments
for
legend
takes
in
patches
","
but
not
patchcollections
.
The
above
is
the
code
to
visualise
the
handler
.
Basically
a
rectangle
with
the
upper
triangle
as
dashed
lines
and
the
lower
as
solid
Using
","
Recreates
the
error
.
Is
there
a
workaround
?
