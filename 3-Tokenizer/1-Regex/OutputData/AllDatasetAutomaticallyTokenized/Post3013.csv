This
program
randomly
generates
weights
for
several
artificial
neural
networks
using
a
loop
","
calculates
the
output
of
the
network
and
appends
that
to
the
end
of
each
array
","
then
appends
the
cost
to
the
end
of
each
array
.
When
run
without
sorting
the
arrays
this
program
does
all
calculations
correctly
","
but
when
I
try
to
sort
the
array
by
the
last
item
in
each
array
it
seems
like
it
breaks
the
loop
even
though
the
sort
function
is
called
after
all
the
other
functions
.
