I
am
trying
to
create
a
single
page
with
different
content
from
different
template
in
django
so
i
can
print
it
.
Its
kind
of
summary
of
different
page
base.html
-
mainContent
block
is
rendered
inside
this
template
main.html
-
Need
mainContent
block
from
here
graph.html
-
Need
mainContent
block
from
here
charts.html
-
Need
mainContent
block
from
here
summary.html
-
Need
content
from
main
","
graph
","
charts
all
together
here
(
REQUIRE
)
I
have
a
base
template
which
is
extended
on
every
page
like
this
(
It
has
navbar
","
footer
and
sidebar
)
There
is
a
block
inside
base
template
where
graph
","
main
","
chart
content
is
displayed
.
What
i
am
trying
to
accomplish
is
to
get
the
mainContent
from
those
page
and
add
it
to
new
template
called
summary.html
Since
every
page
is
extending
from
base
i
am
not
sure
how
to
do
that
?
I
tried
using
include
but
it
will
also
include
base
for
every
page
.
EDIT
:
I
know
i
can
separate
the
mainContent
into
its
own
separate
files
but
i
have
lot
of
templates
and
was
looking
for
any
other
solutions
.
