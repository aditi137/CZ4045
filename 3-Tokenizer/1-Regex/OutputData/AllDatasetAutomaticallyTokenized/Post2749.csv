Basically
I'm
trying
to
take
the
print
output
for
my
code
and
make
it
into
a
variable
.
I
tried
to
do
this
by
converting
it
to
a
string
but
it
gave
me
an
error
saying
""""
TypeError
:
str()
takes
at
most
3
arguments
(
6
given
)
""""
my
code
:
Is
there
either
a
way
to
convert
the
output
to
a
string
despite
the
""""
6
argument
""""
thing
or
some
other
""""
str()
""""
-
like
thing
that
would
work
?
