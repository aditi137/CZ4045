So
today
in
science
class
I
thought
of
making
a
python
script
for
basic
perimeter
of
a
quadrilateral
.
Later
in
future
I
want
to
expand
into
circle
and
other
shape
but
I
got
stuck
in
error
.
Please
help
.
My
code
:
https://repl.it/xHG
And
the
output
comes
funky
.
If
l=2
and
b=1
then
output
comes
as
2211
.
Also
","
how
do
you
expand
it
into
different
shapes
?
I
was
thinking
of
using
if
and
else
options
so
if
choice
=
circle
then
execute
circle
code
elif
if
choice
=
triangle
then
execute
triangle
code
.
Does
anyone
have
a
better
idea
?
