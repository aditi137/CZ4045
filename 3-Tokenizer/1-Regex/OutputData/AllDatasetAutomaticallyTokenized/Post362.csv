Instead
of
posting
a
list
of
your
options
I
will
give
my
humble
opinion
:
I
am
in
love
with
wxPython
.
I
have
used
Qt
in
C
+
+
and
Tk
way
back
in
the
Tcl
days
but
what
really
makes
me
like
wxPython
is
the
demo
that
you
get
with
it
.
In
the
demo
you
can
browse
through
all
the
different
widgets
frames
etc
that
are
part
of
the
framework
see
the
source
code
and
actually
see
how
it
looks
while
it
is
running
.
I
had
some
problems
getting
the
Linux
version
build
and
installed
but
now
that
I
have
it
available
I
use
it
all
the
time
.
I
have
used
wxPython
for
small
data
analysis
applications
and
I
have
written
several
internal
tools
related
to
comparing
test
results
","
merging
source
code
etc.
