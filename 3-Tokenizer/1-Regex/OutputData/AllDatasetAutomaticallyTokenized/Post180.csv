I'm
a
MS-SQL
guy
myself
","
and
we'd
use
DBCC
PINTABLE
to
keep
a
table
cached
","
and
SET
STATISTICS
IO
to
see
that
it's
reading
from
cache
","
and
not
disk
.
I
can't
find
anything
on
Postgres
to
mimic
PINTABLE
","
but
pg_buffercache
seems
to
give
details
on
what
is
in
the
cache
-
you
may
want
to
check
that
","
and
see
if
your
table
is
actually
being
cached
.
A
quick
back
of
the
envelope
calculation
makes
me
suspect
that
you're
paging
from
disk
.
Assuming
Postgres
uses
4-byte
integers
","
you
have
(
6
*
4
)
bytes
per
row
","
so
your
table
is
a
minimum
of
(
24
*
350
","
000
)
bytes
~
8.4MB
.
Assuming
40
MB
/
s
sustained
throughput
on
your
HDD
","
you're
looking
at
right
around
200ms
to
read
the
data
(
which
","
as
pointed
out
","
should
be
where
almost
all
of
the
time
is
being
spent
)
.
Unless
I
screwed
up
my
math
somewhere
","
I
don't
see
how
it's
possible
that
you
are
able
to
read
8MB
into
your
Java
app
and
process
it
in
the
times
you're
showing
-
unless
that
file
is
already
cached
by
either
the
drive
or
your
OS
.
