EasyGUI
is
different
from
other
GUIs
in
that
EasyGUI
is
NOT
event-driven
.
It
allows
you
to
program
in
a
traditional
linear
fashion
","
and
to
put
up
dialogs
for
simple
input
and
output
when
you
need
to
.
If
you
have
not
yet
learned
the
event-driven
paradigm
for
GUI
programming
","
EasyGUI
will
allow
you
to
be
productive
with
very
basic
tasks
immediately
.
Later
","
if
you
wish
to
make
the
transition
to
an
event-driven
GUI
paradigm
","
you
can
do
so
with
a
more
powerful
GUI
package
such
as
anygui
","
PythonCard
","
Tkinter
","
wxPython
","
etc.
