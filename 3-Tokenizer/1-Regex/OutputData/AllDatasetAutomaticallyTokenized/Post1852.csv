I'm
using
boto.dynamodb2
","
and
it
seems
I
can
use
Table.query_count()
.
However
it
had
raised
an
exception
when
no
query
filter
is
applied
.
What
can
I
do
to
fix
this
?
BTW
","
where
is
the
document
of
filters
that
boto.dynamodb2.table.Table.Query
can
use
?
I
tried
searching
for
it
but
found
nothing
.
