I
had
a
similar
problem
on
my
raspberry
pi
(
and
on
my
mac
)
.
In
my
experience
the
pyaudio
library
is
a
pain
to
work
with
(
after
2
weeks
of
battling
it
","
I
ended
up
using
pygame
)
.
What
worked
for
me
was
to
check
the
default
sample
rate
of
the
audio
out
and
check
that
its
the
same
and
play
sounds
back
as
numpy
arrays
.
So
on
the
RPi
","
I'd
check
(
extrapolating
from
ubuntu
here
...
)
the
files
Does
direct
playback
of
numpy
arrays
work
?
If
so
you
could
do
it
in
a
roundabout
way
...
Here
is
some
code
to
test
if
you
like
This
worked
on
my
RPi
and
mac
","
but
as
said
before
I
ended
up
using
pygame
because
even
with
on
and
off
ramps
I
couldn't
get
rid
of
crackling
at
the
beginning
and
end
and
sample
rate
wasn't
something
that
could
be
easily
changed
.
I
would
really
recommend
against
pyaudio
","
but
if
you
are
set
on
it
I
wish
you
the
best
of
luck
!
