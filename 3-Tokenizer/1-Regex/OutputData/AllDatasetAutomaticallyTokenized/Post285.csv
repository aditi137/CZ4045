What
are
come
good
(
or
at
least
clever
)
ways
of
running
multiple
sites
from
a
single
","
common
Python
web
framework
(
ie
:
Pylons
","
TurboGears
","
etc
)
?
I
know
you
can
do
redirection
based
on
the
domain
or
path
to
rewrite
the
URI
to
point
at
a
site-specific
location
and
I've
also
seen
some
brutish
""""
if
site
=
=
'
site1
'
/
elseif
/
elseif
/
etc
""""
that
I
would
like
to
avoid
.
