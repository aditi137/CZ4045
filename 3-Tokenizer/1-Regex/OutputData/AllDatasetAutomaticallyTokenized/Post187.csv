One
other
thing
that
an
RDBMS
generally
does
for
you
is
to
provide
concurrency
by
protecting
you
from
simultaneous
access
by
another
process
.
This
is
done
by
placing
locks
","
and
there's
some
overhead
from
that
.
If
you're
dealing
with
entirely
static
data
that
never
changes
","
and
especially
if
you're
in
a
basically
""""
single
user
""""
scenario
","
then
using
a
relational
database
doesn't
necessarily
gain
you
much
benefit
.
