Others
have
already
explained
why
learning
more
languages
makes
you
a
better
programmer
.
As
for
convincing
your
boss
it's
worth
it
","
this
is
probably
just
your
company's
culture
.
Some
places
make
career
and
skill
progress
a
policy
(
move
up
or
out
)
","
some
places
value
it
but
leave
it
up
to
the
employee's
initiative
","
and
some
places
are
very
focused
on
the
bottom
line
.
If
you
have
to
explain
why
learning
a
language
is
a
good
thing
to
your
boss
","
my
advice
would
be
to
stay
at
work
only
as
long
as
necessary
","
then
go
home
and
study
new
things
on
your
own
.
