I
am
trying
to
use
a
Neural
network
for
a
classification
problem
.
I
have
6
possible
classes
and
the
same
input
may
be
in
more
than
one
class
.
The
problem
is
that
when
I
try
to
train
one
NN
for
each
class
","
I
set
output_num_units
=
1
and
on
train
","
I
pass
the
first
column
of
y
","
y
[
:
","
0
]
.
I
get
the
following
output
and
error
:
If
I
try
to
use
output_num_units=num_class
(
6
)
and
the
full
y
(
all
six
fields
)
","
first
I
get
an
error
of
the
KStratifiedFold
","
because
it
seems
that
it
does
not
expect
y
to
have
multiple
rows
.
If
I
set
eval_size=None
","
than
I
get
the
following
error
:
The
only
configuration
that
is
working
is
setting
more
than
one
output
unit
and
passing
only
one
column
to
y
.
Than
it
trains
the
NN
","
but
is
does
not
seem
to
be
right
as
it
is
giving
me
2
output
layers
","
and
I
have
only
one
Y
to
compare
to
.
What
am
I
doing
wrong
?
Why
can't
I
use
only
one
output
?
Should
I
convert
my
y
classes
from
a
vector
of
6
columns
to
a
vector
of
only
one
column
with
a
number
?
I
use
the
following
code
(
extract
)
:
