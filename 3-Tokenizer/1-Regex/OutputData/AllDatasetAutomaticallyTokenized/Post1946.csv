It's
a
good
question
","
with
not
an
easy
to
find
answer
.
The
main
difference
is
that
local-name
(
)
does
not
consider
prefixes
(
namespaces
)
for
tags
.
For
example
","
given
a
node
<
x:html
"xmlns:x=""http"
:
/
/
www.w3.org
/
1999
/
xhtml
""""
/
>
","
the
local-name
will
match
the
html
tag
","
while
/
/
html
will
not
work
","
and
neither
will
/
/
x:html
.
Please
consider
the
following
code
","
if
you
have
any
questions
feel
free
to
ask
.
Show
me
the
code
Setup
:
It
is
now
not
possible
to
use
the
tag
selector
:
But
using
local-name
we
can
still
get
the
element
(
considering
the
namespace
)
Or
strict
namespace
using
name()
:
Performance
I
parsed
this
website
as
a
tree
and
used
the
following
queries
:
Now
onto
actual
namespaces
.
I
parsed
a
block
from
here
.
Conclusion
I
had
to
rewrite
to
conclusion
since
after
using
the
namespace
method
it
became
obvious
that
the
gain
when
using
namespaces
is
also
there
.
Roughly
2
times
faster
when
specifying
the
namespace
(
causing
optimizations
)
","
rather
than
using
local-name
.
