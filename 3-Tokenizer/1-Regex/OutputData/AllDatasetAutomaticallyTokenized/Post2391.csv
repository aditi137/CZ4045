I
have
a
model
:
and
I
have
a
form
:
the
min_value
option
could
not
be
specified
in
the
accounts
class
but
I
didn't
want
to
remove
the
ksize
field
completely
because
...
I
needed
it
.
It
seems
to
be
working
","
I
have
a
default
value
in
the
form
field
when
displayed
as
expected
and
it
has
a
minimum
allowed
value
.
But
I
am
mixing
PositiveIntegerField
and
IntegerField
and
I
haven't
seen
any
documentation
about
using
this
method
either
.
Can
someone
please
tell
me
if
this
is
safe
/
sensible
?
Thanks
.
