You
probably
want
Twisted
.
There
is
a
P2P
framework
for
Twisted
called
""""
Vertex
""""
.
While
not
actively
maintained
","
it
does
allow
you
to
tunnel
through
NATs
and
make
connections
directly
between
users
in
a
very
abstract
way
;
if
there
were
more
interest
in
this
sort
of
thing
I'm
sure
it
would
be
more
actively
maintained
.
