Your
documentation
reference
is
for
Python
3.0.1
.
There
is
no
good
reason
using
Python
3.0
.
You
should
be
using
3.2
or
2.7
.
What
exactly
are
you
using
?
Suggestion
:
(
1
)
change
bytes
to
raw_bytes
to
avoid
confusion
with
the
bytes
built-in
(
2
)
check
for
raw_bytes
=
=
bytes_back
in
your
test
script
(
3
)
while
your
test
should
work
with
quoted-printable
","
it
is
very
inefficient
for
binary
data
;
use
base64
instead
.
Update
:
Base64
encoding
produces
4
output
bytes
for
every
3
input
bytes
.
Your
base64
code
doesn't
work
with
56-byte
chunks
because
56
is
not
an
integral
multiple
of
3
;
each
chunk
is
padded
out
to
a
multiple
of
3
.
Then
you
join
the
chunks
and
attempt
to
decode
","
which
is
guaranteed
not
to
work
.
Your
chunking
loop
would
be
much
better
written
as
:
In
any
case
","
chunking
is
rather
slow
and
pointless
;
just
do
b2a_base64(raw_bytes)
