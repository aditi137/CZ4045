i
found
there
are
several
posts
here
about
unloading
a
dll
using
ctypes
","
and
i
followed
exactly
the
way
said
to
be
working
from
ctypes
import
*
however
","
i
am
on
python
64
bit
and
my
dll
is
also
compiled
for
x64
","
and
i
got
an
error
from
the
last
line
above
saying
:
and
i
checked
the
handle
to
be
a
long
int
(
int64
)
of
'
8791681138688
'
","
so
does
that
mean
windll.kernel32
only
deals
with
int32
handle
?
Google
search
shows
kernal32
is
also
for
64bit
windows
.
how
should
i
deal
with
this
then
?
