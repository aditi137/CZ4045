The
first
request
the
client
will
never
be
able
to
use
any
local
caches
","
so
at
the
first
request
ETag
isn't
necessary
.
Remember
that
ETag
needs
to
be
passed
into
the
conditional
request
headers
(
If-None-Match
","
If-Match
","
etc
)
","
the
semantic
of
non
conditional
requests
are
clear
.
If
your
feed
is
a
public
feed
","
then
an
intermediate
caching
proxy
are
also
allowed
to
return
an
ETagged
result
for
non
conditional
request
","
although
it
will
always
have
to
contact
origin
server
if
the
conditional
header
doesn't
match
.
