Here
is
the
code
and
output
","
I
think
from
the
output
","
it
mean
when
fpr
is
0
","
tpr
is
0
","
this
is
correct
as
the
prediction
results
marks
everything
to
be
0
.
But
the
output
also
said
","
when
fpr
is
1
","
tpr
is
also
1
.
I
think
it
is
not
correct
","
since
the
predictor
never
predict
something
to
be
positive
(
label
to
be
1
)
","
so
how
could
the
fpr
(
=
#
of
correct
prediction
of
1
/
total
#
of
1
)
and
tpr
(
=
#
of
prediction
of
1
/
total
#
of
0
)
both
to
be
1
?
Output
