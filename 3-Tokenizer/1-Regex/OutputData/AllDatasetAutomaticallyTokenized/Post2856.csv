I'm
very
new
to
Python
and
want
to
know
how
to
end
a
program
with
an
if
statement
that
prints
a
message
","
as
this
does
not
appear
to
be
happening
with
my
'
stand
'
variable
when
it
is
under
<
5000
.
The
if
statement
bolded
*
*
*
*
is
the
code
I'm
having
trouble
with
and
it
still
prints
the
message
I
want
","
however
","
the
program
does
not
stop
with
that
message
but
continue
going
to
the
next
code
(
countdown
variable
)
.
Ignore
'
countdown
'
.
Here
is
a
part
of
my
code
.
