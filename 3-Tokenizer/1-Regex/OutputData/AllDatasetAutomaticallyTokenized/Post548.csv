You
have
not
said
why
you
want
to
move
away
from
Perl
*
.
If
my
crystal
ball
is
functioning
today
then
it
is
because
you
do
not
fully
know
the
language
and
so
it
frustrates
you
.
Stick
with
Perl
and
study
the
language
well
.
If
you
do
then
one
day
you
will
be
a
guru
and
know
why
your
question
is
irrelevant
.
Enlightment
comes
to
those
to
seek
it
.
You
called
it
""""
Perl5
""""
but
there
is
no
such
language
.
