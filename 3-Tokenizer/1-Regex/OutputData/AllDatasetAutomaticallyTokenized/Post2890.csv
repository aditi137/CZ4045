I
have
a
raw
list
sorteddict
in
the
form
of
:
and
I
want
to
generate
more
legible
data
by
making
it
a
JSON
object
that
looks
like
:
Unfortunately
so
far
","
I
have
only
found
a
manual
way
to
create
data
as
shown
above
","
and
was
wondering
if
there
was
a
much
more
eloquent
way
of
generating
the
data
rather
than
my
messy
script
.
I
got
to
the
point
where
I
needed
to
retrieve
the
last
item
in
the
list
and
ensure
that
there
was
no
comma
on
the
last
line
before
I
thought
I
should
seek
some
advice
.
Here's
what
I
had
:
I
have
used
json.JSONEncode.encode()
which
I
thought
that
was
what
I
was
looking
for
","
but
what
ended
up
happening
is
""""
Frequencies
""""
would
be
prepended
to
each
s
[0]
item
.
Any
ideas
to
clean
the
code
?
