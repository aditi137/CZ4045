It
is
not
possible
to
set
the
attitude
directly
because
the
command
is
not
supported
by
Copter
in
either
guided
mode
or
AUTO
mode
/
missions
)
.
The
list
of
supported
commands
in
guided
mode
is
here
and
AUTO
commands
here
.
What
you
can
do
is
set
the
yaw
.
Another
(
hacky
)
approach
that
may
work
is
setting
the
ROI
as
this
will
point
the
camera
(
and
often
the
whole
vehicle
)
at
a
target
.
This
sounds
like
a
reasonable
requirement
-
perhaps
create
a
request
with
explanation
of
why
this
is
useful
for
you
?
