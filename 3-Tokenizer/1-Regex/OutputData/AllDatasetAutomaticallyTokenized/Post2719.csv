EDIT
:
Code
is
revised
to
show
my
attempt
at

I
need
to
execute
some
predefined
searches
and
crawl
the
results
1
level
deep
","
then
parse
those
pages
.
This
has
to
be
done
sequentially
because
the
site
will
not
allow
results
to
be
crawled
unless
those
results
were
just
retrieved
pursuant
to
a
search
.
My
predefined
searches
are
in
a
list
and
I'm
trying
to
loop
through
that
list
","
but
I
cannot
get
it
to
work
.
Scrapy
either
jumps
all
around
or
loops
through
all
the
start_requests
without
parsing
each
as
it
goes
.
Can
anyone
show
me
a
way
to
do
this
?
Thanks
!
The
search
terms
are
simply
pairs
of
date
ranges
which
I've
stored
in
a
list
at
the
beginning
.
Here's
my
[
NEWLY
EDITED
]
code
with
my
non-working
loop
commented
out
:
When
this
runs
","
it
loops
through
the
loop
making
each
request
","
but
it
fails
to
call
self.parse
on
each
loop
(
along
with
all
the
callables
that
run
in
turn
","
after
self.parse
)
.
After
the
loop
","
it
parses
a
single
set
of
search
results
","
then
acts
like
it's
finished
.
Here's
the
pastebin
log
of
it
running
from
PyCharm
.
Any
ideas
?
