I
am
using
a
wxGenericDirCtrl
","
and
I
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
a
way
to
hide
directories
","
I'd
especially
like
to
hide
siblings
of
parent
nodes
.
For
example
if
my
directory
structure
looks
like
this
:
If
my
currently
selected
directory
is
/
a
/
c
/
d
is
there
any
way
to
hide
b
and
g
","
so
that
the
tree
looks
like
this
in
my
ctrl
:
I'm
currently
working
with
a
directory
structure
that
has
lots
and
lots
directories
that
are
irrelevant
to
most
users
","
so
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
clean
it
up
.
Edit
:
If
it
makes
a
difference
","
I
am
using
wxPython
","
and
so
far
","
I
have
only
tested
my
code
on
linux
using
the
GTK
backend
","
but
I
do
plan
to
make
it
multi-platform
and
using
it
on
Windows
and
Mac
using
the
native
backends
.
