I
am
new
to
python
and
django
and
was
wondering
how
I
would
go
about
making
a
dict
of
lists
.
My
4
lists
are

How
would
I
make
that
into
a
dictionary
I
could
then
loop
over
in
a
django
template
such
as
;
Thanks
in
advance
!
Update
:
hmm
I
not
sure
I
posted
my
question
properly
.
In
php
","
I
can
do
the
following
on
an
array
of
fields
:
All
the
form
fields
are
input
text
fields
.
.
How
would
I
do
this
in
Django
?
