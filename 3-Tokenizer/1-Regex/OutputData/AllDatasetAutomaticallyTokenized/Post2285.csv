Consider
this
:
Same
thing
with
slicing
done
before
Now
why
is
the
second
method
faster
than
first
method
?
What
exactly
is
taking
place
here
which
is
causing
the
second
method
to
be
more
efficient
than
first
?
EDIT
:
This
is
a
part
of
a
big
program
which
I
was
attempting
at
one
of
the
sites
.
I
was
getting
timeout
error
with
method
1
with
large
inputs
.
Whereas
the
second
method
did
it
.
It
was
at
least
2
secs
faster.The
string
length
was
10000
for
this
scenario.Here
are
the
two
submissions
