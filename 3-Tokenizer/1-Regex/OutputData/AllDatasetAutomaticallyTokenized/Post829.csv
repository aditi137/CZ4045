My
main
goal
is
to
check
an
FTP
server
at
anytime
for
a
new
file
hits
and
then
generate
a
.
txt
file
with
only
the
new
files
copied
there
.
If
there
are
no
new
files
then
it
returns
nothing
.
Here
is
what
I
have
so
far
.
I
have
started
by
copying
the
files
from
the
server
into
oldlist.txt
","
then
connecting
to
the
FTP
site
and
comparing
data
from
newlist.txt
and
oldlist.txt
and
the
differences
I
want
in
Temporary
FTP
file
changes.txt
.
Each
time
I
connect
I
will
change
newlist.txt
and
make
it
the
oldlist.txt
so
that
I
can
compare
the
next
time
I
connect
.
Is
there
a
better
way
to
do
this
?
My
lists
seem
to
never
change
data
each
time
.
Sorry
if
this
is
confusing
thanks
.
