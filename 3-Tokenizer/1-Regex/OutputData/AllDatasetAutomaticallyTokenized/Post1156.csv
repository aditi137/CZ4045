I
have
a
question
.
I
am
currently
moving
over
from
matlab
to
python
and
whilst
I
found
it
easy
to
adapt
to
numpy
and
scipy
some
parts
are
still
a
bit
enigmatic
;
)
What
I
want
to
do
is
calculate
data
in
two
nested
loops
and
put
(
reshape
)
it
into
an
(
m
","
n
)
array
to
make
a
contour
plot
.
So
I
thought
about
the
following
:
but
now
I
am
not
entirely
sure
how
I
should
put
this
into
the
right
shape
(
in
Matlab
I
would
just
index
the
loops
with
i=1:1:10
and
so
on
and
pull
the
actual
value
of
i
out
of
a
vector
...
)
.
I
could
append
the
results
res.append(res)
and
reshape
it
with
"res.reshape((m,n)"
)
.
But
there
might
be
a
more
elegant
way
of
doing
so
?
Every
help
is
very
welcome
!
best
wishes
","
Chris
