I'm
on
a
Mac
","
and
I
installed
numpy
and
sklearn
in
that
order
.
Now
","
I'm
faced
with
these
errors
that
have
already
been
mentioned
on
SO
several
times
:
sklearn
""""
numpy.dtype
has
the
wrong
size
","
try
recompiling
""""
in
both
pycharm
and
terminal
ValueError
:
numpy.dtype
has
the
wrong
size
","
try
recompiling
ImportError
in
importing
from
sklearn
:
cannot
import name
check_build
So
","
I
try
to
remediate
this
error
by
uninstalling
numpy
","
and
reinstalling
a
previous
version
.
