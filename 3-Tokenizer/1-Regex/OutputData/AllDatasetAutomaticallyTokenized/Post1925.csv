You
managed
to
enter
something
like
an
U+2013
EN
DASH
or
an
U+2014
EM
DASH
","
which
both
look
a
lot
like
the
ASCII
character
U+002D
HYPHEN
MINUS
.
Because
either
of
these
characters
are
outside
of
the
basic
Latin-1
alphabet
","
encoding
either
one
of
these
to
UTF-8
results
in
a
3-byte
sequence
:
Those
two
are
not
the
only
confusable
characters
;
a
few
more
:
U+2010
