I
am
using
ConfigParser
to
get
a
large
number
of
variables
that
are
set
in
a
configuration
file
","
CONFIG.txt
.
I
actually
create
several
dictionaries
from
the
different
config
file
sections
and
have
stored
them
in
a
nested
format
.
I
want
to
keep
the
variables
stored
in
dictionary
format
as
it
makes
it
easy
to
pass
around
many
at
a
time
to
various
functions
.
ConfigParser
stores
all
the
text
from
the
file
as
strings
.
Is
there
a
quick
way
to
typecast
the
variables
properly
.
Some
of
the
variables
are
lists
of
strings
","
some
strings
","
some
integers
and
some
floats
.
I
can
format
the
config
file
how
I
like
and
don't
even
really
need
to
use
ConfigParser
if
someone
can
suggest
a
more
suitable
alternative
.
Thanks
.
