Depending
on
what
you're
doing
.
Because
functions
are
also
objects
in
Python
it
is
possible
to
do
so
.
But
is
it
a
good
solution
?
It
seems
though
that
you're
trying
to
handle
a
problem
which
maybe
could
be
better
solved
with
more
of
an
object
oriented
approach
:
Output
:
In
my
view
this
would
be
a
better
approach
(
if
this
is
possible
/
reasonable
in
your
case
)
:
You
just
call
some_method()
on
your
class
","
maybe
without
even
knowing
what
exact
type
of
object
you're
dealing
with
(
regarding
inheritance
)
.
The
class
itself
knows
what
to
do
and
reacts
accordingly
when
its
method
has
been
called
.
This
of
course
doesn't
work
when
you
work
with
external
libraries
which
you
have
no
influence
on
.
