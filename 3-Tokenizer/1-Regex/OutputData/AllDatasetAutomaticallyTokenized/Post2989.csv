I
am
new
to
Django
and
I
am
currently
having
problems
in
showing
uploaded
images
in
Django
Admin
.
I
have
followed
many
posted
Q
and
A
here
in
stackoverflow
but
of
those
worked
in
my
problem
.
I
hope
any
active
of
the
coding
ninja
here
could
help
me
with
this
problem
.
Here
is
the
detailed
view
of
the
problem
:
I
have
defined
the
MEDIA_ROOT
and
MEDIA_URL
in
settings.py
This
is
my
upload
model
in
models.py
:
In
my
Application
urls.py
:
In
my
admin.py
:
The
image
was
successfully
stored
at
ProjectDIR
/
media
.
The
HTML
returns
the
url
:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/imagename.jpg
at
img
tag
.
But
the
page
fails
to
load
the
image
(
I
will
be
redirected
to
index
page
whenever
when
using
the
url
http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/imagename.jpg
)
.
I
am
using
Django
version
1.10
