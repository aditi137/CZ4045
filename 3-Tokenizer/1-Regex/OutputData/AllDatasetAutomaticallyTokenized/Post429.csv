I
see
on
Stack
Overflow
and
PEP
8
that
the
recommendation
is
to
use
spaces
only
for
indentation
in
Python
programs
.
I
can
understand
the
need
for
consistent
indentation
and
I
have
felt
that
pain
.
Is
there
an
underlying
reason
for
spaces
to
be
preferred
?
I
would
have
thought
that
tabs
were
far
easier
to
work
with
.
