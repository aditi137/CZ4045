The
docs
talk
about
the
complexity
of
combining
advanced
and
basic
indexing
.
The
indexing
coords
comes
first
","
with
the
[
0
","
:
]
after
","
producing
the
the
(
3
","
5
)
.
The
easiest
way
to
understand
the
situation
may
be
to
think
in
terms
of
the
result
shape
.
There
are
two
parts
to
the
indexing
operation
","
the
subspace
defined
by
the
basic
indexing
(
excluding
integers
)
and
the
subspace
from
the
advanced
indexing
part
.
[
in
the
case
where
]
The
advanced
indexes
are
separated
by
a
slice
","
ellipsis
or
newaxis
.
For
example
x
[
arr1
","
:
","
arr2
]
.
....
the
dimensions
resulting
from
the
advanced
indexing
operation
come
first
in
the
result
array
","
and
the
subspace
dimensions
after
that
.
I
recall
discussing
this
kind
of
indexing
in
a
previous
SO
question
","
but
it
would
take
some
digging
to
find
it
.

Why
does
the
order
of
dimensions
change
with
boolean
indexing
?
How
does
numpy
order
array
slice
indices
?
The
[
:
]
in
test
[0]
[
:
]
[coords]
does
nothing
.
test
[0]
[
:
","
coords
]
produces
the
desired
(
5
","
3
)
result
.
