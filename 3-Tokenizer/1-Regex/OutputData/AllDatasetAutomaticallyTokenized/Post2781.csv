If
you
define
__all__
","
then
only
the
attributes
mentioned
there
will
be
imported
via
*
","
while
the
excluded
ones
have
to
be
imported
explicitly
.
So
either
use
or
if
you
really
want
to
use
the
(
discouraged
!
)
from
package
import
*
","
declare
in
package
.
Note
how
tedious
it
will
become
to
keep
this
up-to-date
...
