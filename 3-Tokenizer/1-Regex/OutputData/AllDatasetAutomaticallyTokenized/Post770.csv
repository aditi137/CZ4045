Look
at
two
ways
of
structuring
my
functions
:
Will
the
second
option
be
slower
?
I
only
need
to
call
myFunc
from
myFunc2
","
so
'
d
like
to
hide
it
from
my
module
documentation
","
I
could
use
an
underscore
for
that
","
but
I
thought
it
would
be
cleaner
to
have
it
inside
the
function
.
On
the
other
hand
I
might
need
to
call
myFunc2
few
hundred
times
per
second
","
so
""""
redefining
""""
myFunc
when
calling
myFunc2
each
time
might
be
slow
...
is
that
a
good
guess
?
