I'm
using
using
django
rest
framework
browsable
api
with
ModelViewSet
to
do
CRUD
actions
and
want
to
use
permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly
","
but
when
I'm
logged
and
try
to
DELETE
or
PUT
I
get
""""
detail
""""
:
""""
CSRF
Failed
:
CSRF
token
missing
or
incorrect
.
""""
My
view
looks
like
this
Settings.py
Serializer
is
just
Although
when
I
delete
permission_classes
(
so
the
default
allowAny
triggers
)
I
can
it
works
just
fine
.
What
I
want
To
be
able
to
PUT
/
DELETE
only
when
I'm
authenticated
.
I
don't
know
how
to
send
CSRF
token
","
when
all
happens
automatically
(
modalviewset
does
the
whole
work
)
