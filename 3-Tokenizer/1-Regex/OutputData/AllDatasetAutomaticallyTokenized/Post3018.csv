I
am
looking
for
guidance
in
how
to
achieve
start
/
stop
functionality
of
a
function
","
which
makes
a
restAPI
to
retrieve
data
in
JSON
format
continuously
","
by
clicking
a
button
on
a
rendered
html
page
through
webapp2
and
hosted
on
GAE
?
The
current
behaviour
is
once
the
http
request
is
completed
the
function
that
was
called
of
course
stops
(
while
self._running
=
=
True)(normal
behaviour
according
to
the
GAE
documentation
)
.
