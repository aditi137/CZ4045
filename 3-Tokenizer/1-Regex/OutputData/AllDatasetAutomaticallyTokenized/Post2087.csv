In
:
is
the
standard
ipython
prompt
.
It
is
ipython's
way
of
telling
you
that
it
is
waiting
for
input
(
just
like
>
>
>
in
the
standard
python
interpreter
)
.
Note
that
output_notebook
will
only
function
in
the
browser
(
i.e.
","
in
the
notebook
)
.
If
you
want
to
run
code
in
a
command
line
ipython
shell
(
I
am
assuming
that
is
what
you
mean
by
""""
in
regular
iPython
""""
)
then
you
will
have
to
use
output_file
or
one
of
the
functions
in
bokeh.embed
.
