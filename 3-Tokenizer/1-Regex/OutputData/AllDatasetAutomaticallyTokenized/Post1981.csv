although
the
docs
has
apt-get
...
pip
is
the
better
way
to
install
scrapy
(
Never
failed
for
me
)
sudo
pip
install
scrapyd
works
for
me
and
then
scrapyd
doesn't
give
any
errors
.
When
you
install
with
apt-get
-
twisted
may
not
be
getting
installed
","
but
pip
takes
care
of
that
.
Try
uninstalling
your
apt-get
scrapyd
first
","
and
then
use
pip
to
install
it

Answering
your
next
question
in
the
comment
...
If
you
want
to
run
scrapyd-deploy
you
need
to
also
install
the
package
scrapy-client
which
is
not
installed
along
with
scrapy
.
This
is
mentioned
in
the
docs
-
http://scrapyd.readthedocs.org/en/latest/deploy.html
You
can
install
it
using
sudo
pip
install
scrapyd-client
