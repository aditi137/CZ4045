When
the
character
sequence
\
t
is
found
in
a
string
","
it
will
be
replaced
by
a
TAB
character
.
You
can
actually
see
this
in
the
error
message
.
I'd
recommend
always
using
the
forward
slash
/
as
the
directory
separator
","
even
on
Windows
.
Alternatively
prefix
the
string
with
an
r
like
this
:
"r""does"
not
replace
\
t
with
<
tab
>
.
""""
.
You
might
want
to

string
literals
