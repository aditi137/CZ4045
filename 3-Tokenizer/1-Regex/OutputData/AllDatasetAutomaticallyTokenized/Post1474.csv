I
have
a
list
of
vertices
and
the
length
between
them
.
I
want
to
create
a
function
which
finds
the
distance
between
2
vertices
in
the
list
by
searching
through
the
list
.
the
list
will
look
something
like
:
Say
the
vertices
are
X
and
Y
could
I
index
the
list
using
X
","
Y
to
find
the
length
between
X
and
Y
?
Currently
I
am
doing
it
like
this
:
But
as
the
list
of
lengths
grows
this
could
take
time
.
Thanks
