Suppose
I
have
a
list
of
suits
of
cards
as
follows
:
suits
=
[
""""
h
""""
","
""""
c
""""
","
""""
d
""""
","
""""
s
""""
]
and
I
want
to
add
a
type
of
card
to
each
suit
","
so
that
my
result
is
something
like
aces
=
[
""""
ah
""""
","
""""
ac
""""
","
""""
ad
""""
","
""""
as
""""
]
is
there
an
easy
way
to
do
this
without
recreating
an
entirely
new
list
and
using
a
for
loop
?
