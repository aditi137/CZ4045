Use
a
generic
type
to
indicate
that
you'll
be
returning
an
instance
of
cls
:
Any
subclass
overriding
the
class
method
but
then
returning
an
instance
of
a
parent
class
(
TrivialClass
or
a
subclass
that
is
still
an
ancestor
)
would
be
detected
as
an
error
","
because
the
factory
method
is
defined
as
returning
an
instance
of
the
type
of
cls
.
The
bound
argument
specifies
that
T
has
to
be
a
(
subclass
of
)
TrivialClass
;
because
the
class
doesn't
yet
exist
when
you
define
the
generic
","
you
need
to
use
a
forward
reference
(
a
string
with
the
name
)
.
See
the
Annotating
instance
and
class
methods
section
of
PEP
484
.
Note
:
The
first
revision
of
this
answer
advocated
using
a
forward
reference
naming
the
class
itself
as
the
return
value
","
but
issue
1212
made
it
possible
to
use
generics
instead
","
a
better
solution
.
