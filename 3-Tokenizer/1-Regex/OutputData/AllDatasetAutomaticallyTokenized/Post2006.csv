The
issue
you're
having
is
that
your
code
expects
the
""""
-
mc
""""
suffix
to
appear
in
lowercase
","
but
you're
calling
the
upper()
method
on
the
input
string
","
resulting
in
text
that
is
all
upper
case
.
You
need
to
change
one
of
those
so
that
they
match
(
it
doesn't
really
matter
which
one
)
.
Either
replace
the
upper()
call
with
lower()
","
or
replace
the
string
""""
-
mc
""""
with
""""
-
MC
""""
","
and
your
code
should
work
better
(
I'm
not
certain
I
understand
all
of
it
","
so
there
may
be
other
issues
)
.
