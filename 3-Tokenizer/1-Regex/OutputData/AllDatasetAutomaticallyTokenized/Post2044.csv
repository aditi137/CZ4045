I
need
to
be
able
to
determine
(
or
predict
)
when
a
unicode
character
won't
be
printable
.
For
instance
","
if
I
print
this
unicode
character
under
default
settings
","
it
prints
fine
:
But
if
I
print
another
unicode
character
","
it
prints
as
a
stupid
","
weird
square
:
I
really
need
to
be
able
to
determine
before
a
character
is
printed
if
it
will
display
like
this
as
an
ugly
square
(
or
sometimes
as
an
anonymous
blank
)
.
What
causes
this
","
and
how
can
I
predict
it
?
