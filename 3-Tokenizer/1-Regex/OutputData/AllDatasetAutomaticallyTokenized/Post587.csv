I
want
my
Python
script
to
copy
files
on
Vista
.
When
I
run
it
from
a
normal
cmd.exe
window
","
no
errors
are
generated
","
yet
the
files
are
NOT
copied
.
If
I
run
cmd.exe
""""
as
administator
""""
and
then
run
my
script
","
it
works
fine
.
This
makes
sense
since
User
Account
Control
(
UAC
)
normally
prevents
many
file
system
actions
.
Is
there
a
way
I
can
","
from
within
a
Python
script
","
invoke
a
UAC
elevation
request
(
those
dialogs
that
say
something
like
""""
such
and
such
app
needs
admin
access
","
is
this
OK
?
""""
)
If
that's
not
possible
","
is
there
a
way
my
script
can
at
least
detect
that
it
is
not
elevated
so
it
can
fail
gracefully
?
