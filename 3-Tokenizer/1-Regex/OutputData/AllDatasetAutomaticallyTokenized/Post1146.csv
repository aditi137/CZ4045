I
am
writing
a
Python
script
that
will
take
an
IP
address
in
CIDR
format
(
ie
.
1.1.1.0
/
32
or
10.0.0.1
/
24
)
and
split
the
IP
into
three
parts
:
the
first
three
octets
(
1.1.1
)
","
the
last
octet
(
0
)
and
the
Subnet
mask
(
32
)
.
The
IP
will
be
of
variable
length
so
I
don't
know
if
I
can
use
some
sort
of
string
character
counter
.
Any
ideas
?
Thanks
