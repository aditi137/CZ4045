I
am
looking
for
a
way
to
get
stuff
from
a
callback
into
a
generator
","
or
the
generator
to
inherit
the
callback
.
When
the
callback
is
called
","
the
generator
should
run
","
yielding
the
data
.
While
I
normally
would
use
a
queue
and
a
thread
to
run
and
get
that
callback
","
in
this
case
I
am
running
inside
a
python
extension
of
an
cli
which
calls
my_callback(data)
.
As
a
result
","
I
can't
use
threading
","
as
python
will
only
execute
that
callback
.
Afterwards
the
C
part
of
the
cli
will
do
stuff
again
","
and
python
is
not
executed
.
Edit
:
I
could
register
a
'
poll
'
function
","
which
will
get
called
periodically
.
Putting
a
wait
in
there
give
at
least
the
thread-queue
construction
some
time
to
execute
.
But
that
feels
to
dirty
for
actual
code
.
