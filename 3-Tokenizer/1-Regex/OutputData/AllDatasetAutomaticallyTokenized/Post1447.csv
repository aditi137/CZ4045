I'm
not
sure
if
these
tips
are
directly
applicable
to
the
PO
","
but
they
landed
me
here
","
so
maybe
it
will
be
helpful
.
Be
sure
to
check
the
README
file
within
the
flaskr
directory
which
specifies
running
flask
-
-
app=flaskr
initdb
from
the
command
line
.
If
this
returns
AttributeError
:
'
Flask
'
object
has
no
attribute
'
cli
'
","
it
may
be
due
to
click
not
being
installed
.
If
the
command
returns
flask
:
command
not
found
","
it
may
be
due
to
having
an
older
version
of
Flash
installed
","
which
is
what
pip
install
flask
does
.
As
of
today
this
command
pip
install
"https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/tarball/master,"
will
install
the
most
recent
version
.
