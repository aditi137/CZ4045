If
you
want
to
run
a
Python
code
in
a
separate
process
","
you
could
use
multiprocessing
module
:
I
wondered
whether
using
a
subprocess
module
and
multiprocess
module
in
the
same
function
is
prohibited
?
No
.
You
can
use
both
subprocess
and
multiprocessing
in
the
same
function
(
moreover
","
multiprocessing
may
use
subprocess
to
start
its
worker
processes
internally
)
.
Reason
I
want
this
is
that
I
have
two
things
to
run
:
first
an
exe
file
","
and
second
a
function
","
each
needs
it
own
process
.
You
don't
need
multprocessing
to
run
an
external
command
without
blocking
(
obviously
","
in
its
own
process
)
;
subprocess.Popen()
is
enough
:
