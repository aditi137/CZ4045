As
the
other
answers
already
pointed
out
","
tornado
works
asynchronously
.
You
have
to
run
the
requests
in
an
IOLoop
.
Please
note
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
multithreading
.
The
requests
are
executed
in
parallel
","
but
within
a
single
thread
(
the
core
feature
of
async
IO
)
.
This
is
how
it
could
be
done
:
Your
code
only
creates
1000
request
objects
(
Future
objects
to
be
precise
)
","
that
are
actually
never
send
to
the
server
.
