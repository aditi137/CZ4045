Hi
im
sure
there
is
a
much
more
efficient
way
of
coding
this
","
im
primarily
a
java
programmer
but
trying
to
help
some
one
out
with
some
basic
python
.
I
need
to
have
a
2D
array
which
contains
a
set
of
random
co-ordinates
eg
(
2
","
10
)
.
My
initial
thought
was
to
create
the
array
then
fill
it
will
smaller
arrays
containing
the
two
co-ordinates
.
This
produces
the
error
ValueError
:
setting
an
array
element
with
a
sequence
.
So
whats
the
best
way
to
go
about
solving
this
problem
?
Sorry
for
this
hacked
together
code
i've
never
really
had
to
use
python
before
!
