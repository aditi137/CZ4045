Short
Answer
:
Yes
","
of
course
.
All
you
need
is
to
wrap
the
C
+
+
code
with
a
Python
wrapper
.
Elaborated
:
Suppose
your
C
+
+
code
is
inside
class_file.h
.
In
the
same
directory
","
create
a
.
pxd
file
with
any
name
of
your
choice
with
the
following
content
This
is
the
wrapper
of
the
C
+
+
file
.
That's
all
you
have
to
do
using
Cython
.
Further
you
need
to
write
a
.
pyx
file
and
cimport
your
pxd
file
like
a
simple
module
.
You
also
need
to
have
a
setup.py
which
will
create
a
.
so
file
which
can
be
imported
by
Python
as
easily
as
any
other
python
module
.

visit

for
any
more
help
.
I
hope
you
find
Cython
very
easy
and
very
light-based
.
