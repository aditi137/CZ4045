I'm
not
able
understand
what
to
do
here
.
Can
someone
help
.
I've
a
few
lists
:
slice
is
a
list
of
indices
I
need
to
get
from
slicing
array
.
interval
is
a
list
of
indices
used
to
stop
the
slicing
when
slice
[i]
is
interval
[j]
where
i
and
j
are
looping
variables
.
I
need
to
form
a
list
of
lists
from
array
based
on
slice
and
intervals
based
on
the
condition
that
when
slice
[i]
is
not
interval
[j]
here
in
my
case
:
when
slice
[i]
and
interval
[j]
are
equal
for
value
12
.
So
I
need
to
form
a
list
of
lists
from
array
which
is
and
when
slice
[i]
is
interval
[j]
output
=
output
+
intermediate
and
the
slicing
is
continued
.
which
is
now
the
next
value
in
interval
is
17
so
till
we
have
17
in
slice
we
form
another
list
from
array
[
slice
[6]
:
slice
[
6+1
]
+
1
]
and
add
this
to
the
output
.
This
continues
.
The
final
output
should
be
:
which
is
