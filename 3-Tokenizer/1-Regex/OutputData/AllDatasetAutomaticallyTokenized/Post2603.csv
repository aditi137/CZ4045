I
am
creating
a
histogram
in
Seaborn
of
my
data
in
a
pretty
standard
way
","
ie
:
This
produces
the
following
output
:
I
also
want
to
visualize
the
mean
+
standard
deviation
of
this
dataset
on
the
same
plot
","
ideally
by
having
a
point
for
the
mean
on
the
x-axis
(
or
right
above
the
x-axis
)
and
notched
error
bars
showing
the
standard
deviation
.
Another
option
is
a
boxplot
hugging
the
x-axis
.
I
tried
just
adding
the
line
which
is
commented
out
(
sns.boxplot()
)
","
but
it
looks
super
ugly
and
not
at
all
what
I'm
looking
for
.
Any
suggestions
?
