I've
tried
several
different
things
and
crawled
around
on
lots
of
forums
looking
for
an
answer
to
this
question
.
My
goal
is
to
simply
parse
through
a
wireshark
.
pcap-ng
trace
file
using
Python
.
From
what
I
can
gather
","
it
seems
like
I
need
a
libpcap
wrapper
for
Python
or
perhaps
WinCap
(
PyCapy
?
)
I'm
relatively
new
to
Python
","
so
if
you
all
have
any
pointers
on
how
to
install
this
module
please
let
me
know
.
Earlier
I
had
a
32bit
version
of
Python
installed
and
found
a
win32
installer
and
was
able
to
parse
through
.
pcap
files
but
I
really
want
to
be
able
to
parse
through
the
.
pcapng
files
.
Thanks
guys
