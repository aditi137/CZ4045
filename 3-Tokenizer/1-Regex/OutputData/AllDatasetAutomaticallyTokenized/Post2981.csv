A
cheap
trick
to
accomplish
this
would
be
to
filter
by
disjoint
testing
using
a
dynamically
updated
set
of
exclusion
values
","
but
it
wouldn't
actually
avoid
generating
the
combinations
you
wish
to
exclude
","
so
it's
not
a
major
performance
benefit
(
though
filtering
using
a
C
built-in
function
like
isdisjoint
will
be
faster
than
Python
level
if
checks
with
continue
statements
typically
","
by
pushing
the
filter
work
to
the
C
layer
)
