You
need
to
maintain
a
reference
to
your
PhotoImage
object
.
Unfortunately
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
tkinter
in
that
attaching
a
Button
to
a
parent
widget
increments
the
reference
count
","
but
adding
an
image
to
a
widget
does
not
increment
the
reference
count
.
As
a
consequence
at
the
moment
the
CharPhoto
variable
goes
out
of
scope
at
the
end
of
the
function
CharClick
","
the
number
of
reference
to
the
PhotoImage
falls
to
zero
and
the
object
is
made
available
for
garbage
collection
.
If
you
keep
a
reference
to
the
image
somewhere
","
it
will
appear
.
When
you
kept
it
globally
it
remained
in
scope
for
the
entire
script
and
hence
appeared
.
You
can
keep
a
reference
to
it
in
the
PokemonClass
object
or
in
the
Label
widget
.
Below
is
the
later
of
those
options
