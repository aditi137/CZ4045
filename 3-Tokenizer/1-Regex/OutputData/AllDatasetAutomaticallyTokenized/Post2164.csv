does
something
like
this
pseudo
code
:
The
module
inputs
is
cached
in
sys.modules
.
If
you
do
a
reload(inputs)
","
the
cached
module
is
reloaded
","
but
the
assignment
process
which
loads
the
data
from
the
imported
module
to
the
local
name
space
is
not
repeated
.
You
have
to
do
so
by
hand
","
as
the
other
answer
already
states
.
