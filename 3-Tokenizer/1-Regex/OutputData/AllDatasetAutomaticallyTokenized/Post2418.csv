I
have
the
following
form
which
is
working
perfectly
:
However
","
as
you
can
see
the
campaignno
is
hard
written
into
the
query
.
Ideally
I
would
like
to
select
the
maximum
campaignno
from
a
mysql
table
and
use
that
as
the
campaigno
instead
of
the
102501349
as
above
.
The
mysql
table
and
model
is
as
follows
:
mySQL
table
:
Django
Model
:
I
hope
this
makes
sense
but
if
you
require
any
more
information
then
just
ask
:
)
I
appreciate
any
assistance
in
advance
","
many
thanks
","
