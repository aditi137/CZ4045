I
found
a
way
makeing
it
easy
to
automatically
generate
multiple
Tabs
with
the
ttk
notebook
.
As
a
""""
solution
""""
to
:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39175898/automatic-multiple-tab-generation-with-tkinter-notebook?noredirect=1#comment65695477_39175898
But
now
I
have
a
problem
to
fill
the
Tabs
with
individual
content
namely
widgets
.
What
do
I
need
for
""""
?
?
?
""""
in
the
commented
out
part
?
I
would
appreciate
it
very
much
if
you
show
me
how
to
solve
this
.
