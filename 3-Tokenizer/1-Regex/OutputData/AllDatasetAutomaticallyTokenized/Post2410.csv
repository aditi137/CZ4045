I'm
having
trouble
styling
my
django
form
with
a
ModelMultipleChoiceField
.
Heres
my
form
:
And
I
used
this
for
html
:
This
requires
me
to
put
my
HTML
in
my
forms
file
","
which
is
not
a
very
mvc
way
.
Also
it
restricts
me
heavily
in
how
i
can
style
the
list
(
i.e
making
table
of
the
model
instance
fields
)
Is
there
anyway
to
make
this
smarter
?
I'd
like
to
access
{
{
skript.name
}
}
","
{
{
skript.checkbox
}
}
or
something
in
my
{
%
for
skript
in
result_form.skripten
%
}
loop
","
but
thats
sadly
not
possible
...
