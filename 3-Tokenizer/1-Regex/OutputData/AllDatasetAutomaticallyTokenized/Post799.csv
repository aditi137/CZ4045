You're
doing
some
very
odd
things
here
.
Let's
go
through
a
few
of
them
.
1
-
name
=
jobs
[j]
[
'
Job_Name
'
]
[0]
It
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
jobs
is
a
container
of
dictionaries
","
which
have
a
key
'
Job_Name
'
","
and
that
key's
value
is
a
list
or
tuple
.
I
think
what
you
might
mean
is
:
name
=
j
[
'
Job_name
'
]
[0]
If
jobs
is
just
a
list
of
strings
","
being
job
names
","
all
you
need
is
this
:
name
=
j
","
which
you
can
just
skip
-
and
just
use
j
when
you
want
to
refer
to
it
.
2
-
"p=re.compile(""(\\w*):?\\w*-?\\d"
*
""""
)
You're
compiling
your
regex
every
time
you
go
through
the
loop
","
where
it
is
exactly
the
same
each
time
","
and
you
use
it
exactly
once
.
Do
this
compilation
before
the
loop
begins
.
3
-
You
don't
need
your
else
clause
at
all
.
And
if
you
want
""""
else
if
""""
in
Python
","
you
use
""""
elif
""""
.
4
-
Your
regex
could
be
simplified
by
using
a
raw
string
to
eliminate
all
the
double
escapes
:
"p=re.compile(r""(\w*):?\w*-?\d"
*
""""
)
5
-
Your
whole
regex
may
be
unnecessary
.
If
you're
doing
what
I
think
you're
doing
","
you
just
want
what
appears
before
the
first
colon
","
if
there
is
one
.
(
Unless
you
really
mean
group(1)
","
which
I
think
you
don't
.
)
Which
means
you
could
skip
the
regex
(
since
you're
matching
with
in
anyhow
)
","
and
just
use
something
like
name
=
name.split(':')
[0]
