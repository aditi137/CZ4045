I
have
a
class
inheriting
from
collections.OrderedDict
with
an
initializer
that
takes
a
positional
argument
without
default
.
My
goal
is
to
create
a
shallow
copy
of
the
instance
.
However
","
my
initial
naive
approach
below
does
not
work
and
raises
a
type
error
as
the
positional
argument
must
be
supplied
when
building
the
new
instance
.
A
solution
could
be
to
add
:
But
this
becomes
unwieldy
when
the
number
of
attribute
grows
.
Is
there
a
better
","
more
direct
solution
to
this
problem
?
EDIT
:
I
am
using
Python
3.5
