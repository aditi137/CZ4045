This
is
what
capturing
groups
are
designed
to
do
.
The
?
:
inside
the
old
groups
(
the
parentheses
)
means
that
the
group
is
now
a
non-capturing
group
;
that
is
","
it
won't
be
accessible
as
a
group
in
the
result
.
I
converted
them
to
keep
the
output
simpler
","
but
you
can
leave
them
as
capturing
groups
if
you
prefer
(
but
then
you
have
to
use
matches.group(2)
instead
","
since
the
first
quote
would
be
the
first
captured
group
)
.
