Running
%
edit
?
will
give
you
the
help
for
the
%
edit
magic
function
.
You
need
to
set
c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor
","
which
is
in
your
ipython_config.py
.
I'm
not
quite
sure
where
this
is
located
in
Windows
;
on
OS
X
and
Linux
","
it
is
in
~
/
.
ipython
.
You'll
want
to
set
the
variable
to
be
the
full
path
of
the
editor
you
want
.
Alternatively
","
you
can
create
an
environment
variable
EDITOR
in
Windows
itself
","
and
set
that
equal
to
the
full
path
of
the
editor
you
want
.
iPython
should
use
that
.
