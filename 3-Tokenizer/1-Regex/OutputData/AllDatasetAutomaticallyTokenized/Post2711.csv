As
@MartijnPieters
mentioned
","
dictionaries
lack
indices
","
but
they
do
have
keys
.
The
following
function
pred()
(
short
for
""""
predecessor
""""
)
returns
the
key
of
the
item
whose
duration
is
the
largest
duration
<
=
the
passed
duration
.
It
returns
None
(
which
can
be
tested
for
)
if
the
passed
duration
is
smaller
than
all
of
the
durations
in
the
dictionary
:
For
example
","
if
(
by
the
way
-
-
don't
use
dict
as
an
identifier
since
it
has
a
predefined
meaning
in
Python
)
then
:
Note
that
On
Edit
:
Here
is
another
variation
on
the
same
idea
","
one
that
returns
an
integer
rank
:
Then
:
Final
Edit
:
At
the
cost
of
some
readability
","
here
is
a
1-liner
:
