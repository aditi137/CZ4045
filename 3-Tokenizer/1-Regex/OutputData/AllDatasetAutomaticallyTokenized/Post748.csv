I'm
looking
for
a
python
library
/
module
that
will
allow
me
to
create
eye
catching
charts
.
The
module
must
have
/
support
the
following
Windows
Support
As
I
work
mainly
in
windows(using Eclipse in Windows)
","
this
is
crucial
","
a
simple
install
.
exe
file
(
or
adequate
install
instructions
a
must
)
Work
on
Python
2.7
I've
got
Python
2.7.2
installed
don't
really
want
to
go
get
some
other
thing
.
Not
require
being
on
the
web
I've
looked
at
googlepychart
","
and
it
looks
like
you
need
to
be
on
the
web
to
make
it
work
","
I'm
not
on
the
world
wide
web
","
actually
behind
a
VERY
restrictive
firewall
.
Output
should
be
viewable
from
HTML
browser
While
I
cannot
get
onto
the
WorldWideWeb
","
I
can
see
localhost
","
it
would
be
great
if
the
chart
result
be
viewable
in
a
browser
.
Good
documentation
","
at
the
very
least
some
samples
on
how
I
can
use
the
library
.
If
there
are
any
suggestions
on
how
I
can
create
a
web
app
using
python
that
simply
display
/
charts
the
data
i
pass
in
","
such
advice
would
be
much
