Ok
so
","
I'm
16
and
am
new
to
Python
.
I
need
projects
to
do
to
help
me
learn
","
so
I
came
up
with
a
PlayStation
Plus
code
generator
as
a
project
and
so
far
it
does
:
-
Generates
a
code
-
Logs
in
to
Account
Management
at
Sony's
site
-
Enters
code
at
redeem
section
-
Checks
if
error
occurred
It
works
completely
fine
if
only
done
ONCE
but
if
for
example
","
I
set
amount
to
2
","
I
get
my
error
message
""""
Error
found
""""
and
then
it
crashes
and
gives
me
this
:
Any
help
or
advice
would
be
appreciated
","
I
apologize
before
hand
if
this
is
not
detailed
enough
.
