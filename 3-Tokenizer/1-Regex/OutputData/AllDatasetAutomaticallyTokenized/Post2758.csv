In
Python
2
","
it's
O(n)
","
and
it
builds
a
new
list
.
In
Python
3
","
it's
O(1)
","
but
it
doesn't
return
a
list
.
To
draw
a
random
element
from
a
dict's
keys
","
you'd
need
to
convert
it
to
a
list
.
It
sounds
like
you
were
probably
using
random.choice(d.keys()
)
for
part
3
of
that
problem
.
If
so
","
that
was
O(n)
","
and
you
got
it
wrong
.
You
need
to
either
implement
your
own
hash
table
or
maintain
a
separate
list
of
elements
","
without
sacrificing
average-case
O(1)
insertions
and
deletions
.
