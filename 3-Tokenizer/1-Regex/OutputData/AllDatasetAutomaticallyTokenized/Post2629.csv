This
can
be
treated
as
a
binary
text
classification
problem
.
You
should
collect
documents
that
contain
'
adult-content
'
as
well
as
documents
that
do
not
contain
adult
content
(
'
universal
'
)
.
It
may
so
happen
that
a
word
/
phrase
that
you
have
included
in
the
list
arrBad
may
be
present
in
the
'
universal
'
document
","
for
example
","
'
girl
on
top
'
in
the
sentence
'
She
wanted
to
be
the
first
girl
on
top
of
Mt
.
Everest
.
'
You
need
to
get
a
count
vector
of
the
number
of
times
each
word
/
phrase
occurs
in
a
'
adult-content
'
document
and
a
'
universal
'
document
.
I'd
suggest
you
consider
using
algorithms
like
Naive
Bayes
(
which
should
work
fairly
well
in
your
case
)
.
However
","
if
you
want
to
capture
the
context
in
which
each
phrase
is
used
","
you
could
consider
the
Support
Vector
Machines
algorithm
as
well
(
but
that
would
involve
tweaking
a
lot
of
complex
parameters
)
.
