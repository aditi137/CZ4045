I
am
writing
a
program
to
simulate
the
actual
polling
data
companies
like
Gallup
or
Rasmussen
publish
daily
:
www.gallup.com
and
www.rassmussenreports.com
I'm
using
a
brute
force
method
","
where
the
computer
generates
some
random
daily
polling
data
and
then
calculates
three
day
averages
to
see
if
the
average
of
the
random
data
matches
pollsters
numbers
.
(
Most
companies
poll
numbers
are
three
day
averages
)
Currently
","
it
works
well
for
one
iteration
","
but
my
goal
is
to
have
it
produce
the
most
common
simulation
that
matches
the
average
polling
data
.
I
could
then
change
the
code
of
anywhere
from
1
to
1000
iterations
.
And
this
is
my
problem
.
At
the
end
of
the
test
I
have
an
array
in
a
single
variable
that
looks
something
like
this
:
The
program
currently
produces
one
array
for
each
correct
simulation
.
I
can
store
each
array
in
a
single
variable
","
but
I
then
have
to
have
a
program
that
could
generate
1
to
1000
variables
depending
on
how
many
iterations
I
requested
!
?
How
do
I
avoid
this
?
I
know
there
is
an
intelligent
way
of
doing
this
that
doesn't
require
the
program
to
generate
variables
to
store
arrays
depending
on
how
many
simulations
I
want
.
Code
testing
for
McCain
:
How
do
I
repeat
without
creating
multiple
mcwork
vars
?
