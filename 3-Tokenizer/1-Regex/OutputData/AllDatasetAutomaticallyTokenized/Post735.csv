(
I'm
aware
this
isn't
exactly
what
you're
asking
for
","
but
)
If
you're
happy
with
the
auto-completion
/
suggestions
appearing
on
TAB
(
as
used
in
many
shells
)
","
then
you
can
quickly
get
up
and
running
using
the
readline
module
.
Here's
a
quick
example
based
on
Doug
Hellmann's
PyMOTW
writeup
on
readline
.
This
results
in
the
following
behaviour
(
<
TAB
>
representing
a
the
tab
key
being
pressed
)
:
In
the
last
line
(
HOTAB
entered
)
","
there
is
only
one
possible
match
and
the
whole
sentence
""""
how
are
you
""""
is
auto
completed
.
Check
out
the
linked
articles
for
more
information
on
readline
.
""""
And
better
yet
would
be
if
it
would
complete
words
not
only
from
the
beginning
...
completion
from
arbitrary
part
of
the
string
.
""""
This
can
be
achieved
by
simply
modifying
the
match
criteria
in
the
completer
function
","
ie
.
from
:
to
something
like
:
This
will
give
you
the
following
behaviour
:
Updates
:
using
the
history
buffer
(
as
mentioned
in
comments
)
A
simple
way
to
create
a
pseudo-menu
for
scrolling
/
searching
is
to
load
the
keywords
into
the
history
buffer
.
You
will
then
be
able
to
scroll
through
the
entries
using
the
up
/
down
arrow
keys
as
well
as
use
Ctrl+R
to
perform
a
reverse-search
.
To
try
this
out
","
make
the
following
changes
:
When
you
run
the
script
","
try
typing
Ctrl+r
followed
by
a
.
That
will
return
the
first
match
that
contains
""""
a
""""
.
Enter
Ctrl+r
again
for
the
next
match
.
To
select
an
entry
","
press
ENTER
.
Also
try
using
the
UP
/
DOWN
keys
to
scroll
through
the
keywords
.
