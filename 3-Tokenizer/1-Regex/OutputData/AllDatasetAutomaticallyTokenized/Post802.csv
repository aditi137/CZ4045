Is
there
any
way
that
regular
expression
match
inside
a
if
block
would
interfere
with
the
code
inside
an
else
block
?
In
the
following
code
","
I
have
100
test
strings
that
are
being
inputed
as
job_name
that
should
be
appended
to
my
del_job_ids
array
.
Only
99
of
them
are
being
appended
.
If
I
comment
out
the
line
name=p.match(name).group(1
)
","
the
one
case
that
doesn't
get
appended
before
now
get
appended
.
I
can
also
append
that
job
by
uncommmenting
the
code
in
the
else
block
(
the
string
passes
the
conditon
for
getting
appended
)
.
The
difference
between
the
strings
is
that
99
of
them
have
colon
","
dashes
","
or
both
and
the
one
other
string
has
neither
.
I
tested
the
regex
multiple
times
.
The
string
without
dashes
or
colons
should
go
the
else
clause
and
use
the
'
default
'
name
defined
at
the
top
of
the
for
loop
.
