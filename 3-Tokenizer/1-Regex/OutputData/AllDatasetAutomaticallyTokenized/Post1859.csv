Assume
that
I
have
the
following
data
set
Now
","
I'd
like
to
find
the
last
value
of
each
month
","
move
it
monthwise
to
the
values
of
the
next
month
","
and
finally
take
the
cumulative
product
of
these
values
.
Doing
this
procedure
for
the
above
data
should
result
in
(
performing
each
step
)
:
Finding
the
last
entry
of
each
month
and
moving
them
monthwise
would
result
in
Filling
the
NaN's
with
1
","
taking
the
cumulative
product
","
and
dropping
temp
would
result
in
I
hope
that
this
is
clear
enough
.
And
if
anyone
wonders
why
on
earth
I'd
like
to
do
this
is
because
I've
got
MTD-data
","
and
it
needs
to
be
resampled
.
Thanks

The
number
of
entries
per
month
are
""""
random
""""
","
as
in
they
can
either
be
as
long
as
the
month
or
shorter
(
business
data
