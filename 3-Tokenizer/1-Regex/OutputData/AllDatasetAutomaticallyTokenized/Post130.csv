As
of
Django
1.1
you
can
use
the
cached_db
session
back
end
.
This
stores
the
session
in
the
cache
(
only
use
with
memcached
)
","
and
writes
it
back
to
the
DB
.
If
it
has
fallen
out
of
the
cache
","
it
will
be
read
from
the
DB
.
Although
this
is
slower
than
just
using
memcached
for
storing
the
session
","
it
adds
persistence
to
the
session
.
