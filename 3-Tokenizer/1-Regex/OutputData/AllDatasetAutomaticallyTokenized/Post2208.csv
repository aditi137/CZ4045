Say
you
need
to
solve
and
you
know
t1
.
Then
you
need
to
solve
so
that
basically
you
:
remove
the
4th
column
from
the
matrix
subtract
the
right-hand-side
by
this
4th
column
multipled
by
t1
remove
t1
as
a
variable
Once
you
have
the
appropriate
matrices
","
just
call
numpy.linalg.solve
(
or
something
similar
)
.
I
suggest
that
you
don't
concern
yourself
with
whether
you're
""""
doing
least
squares
""""
","
or
whether
it's
unique
or
not
.
Let
linalg.solve
find
the
optimal
solution
(
in
the
L2
sense
)
;
if
the
solution
is
unique
","
then
it
is
unique
in
the
L2
sense
as
well
.
