It's
fairly
easy
to
create
a
series
of
buttons
and
bind
them
to
the
same
handler
.
I
wrote
on
this
topic
a
few
years
ago
here
.
Using
that
example
","
I
created
something
simple
using
your
example
:
You
will
probably
want
to
change
it
up
slightly
so
that
the
value
of
the
quote
dictionary
is
another
data
structure
that
contains
the
label
of
the
button
and
the
quote
instead
of
using
the
same
string
for
the
button's
label
and
its
name
.
