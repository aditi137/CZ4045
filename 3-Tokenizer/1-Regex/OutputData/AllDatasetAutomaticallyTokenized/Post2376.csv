Here
is
what
ended
up
being
the
true
cause
.
I
had
environment
variables
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
and
django_settings_module
-
same
name
","
different
case
.
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE
was
set
appropriately
to
config.settings.local
","
while
django_settings_module
was
set
to
asd
.
I
had
no
idea
that
1
)
both
of
these
were
defined
and
2
)
the
shell
(
Cygwin
shell
","
anyways
)
randomly
returns
a
value
despite
case
differences
.
