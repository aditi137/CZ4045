So
this
is
a
class
to
store
your
sprite
in
.
I
don't
believe
you
need
2
","
because
you
can
have
a
list
of
all
of
your
instances
of
space
for
example
in
main
","
instead
of
having
...
I
would
recommend
doing
something
like
.
and
then
change
to
then
instead
of
do
finally
instead
of
do
I
hope
that
this
works
for
you
","
as
I
see
this
as
a
reasonable
way
to
store
your
instances
of
space
and
allows
you
to
more
easily
have
the
code
with
less
code
.
If
you
have
any
problems
implementing
this
","
please
just
leave
a
comment
and
I
will
help
you
fix
it
.
Cheers
!
