I
am
trying
to
write
a
small
python
script
to
rename
a
bunch
of
filenames
by
searching
and
replacing
.
For
example
:
Original
filename
:
MyMusic.Songname.Artist-mp3.iTunes.mp3
Intendet
Result
:
Songname.Artist.mp3
what
i've
got
so
far
is
:
(
got
it
from
this
site
as
far
as
i
can
remember
)
Anyway
","
this
will
only
get
rid
of
the
String
at
the
beginning
","
but
not
of
those
in
the
filename
.
Also
I
would
like
to
maybe
use
a
seperate
file
(
eg
badwords.txt
)
containing
all
the
strings
that
should
be
searched
for
and
replaced
","
so
that
i
can
update
them
without
having
to
edit
the
whole
code
.
I
have
been
searching
for
quite
some
time
now
but
havent
found
anything
.
Would
appreciate
any
help
!
Thank
you
!
