You
should
also
consider
learning
a

It
has
many
of
the
advantages
of
Ruby
","
including
a
concise
syntax
","
and
powerful
features
like
closures
.
But
it
compiles
to
Java
class
files
and
and
integrate
seamlessly
into
a
Java
stack
","
which
may
make
it
much
easier
for
your
employer
to
swallow
.
Scala
isn't
dynamically
typed
","
but
its
""""
implicit
conversion
""""
feature
gives
many
","
perhaps
even
all
of
the
benefits
of
dynamic
typing
","
while
retaining
