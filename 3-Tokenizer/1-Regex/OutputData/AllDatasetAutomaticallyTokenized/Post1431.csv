The
issue
with
me
was
that
I
installed
python
","
cx_oracle
as
root
but
Oracle
client
installation
was
done
by
""""
oracle
""""
user
.
I
got
my
own
oracle
installation
and
that
fixed
the
issue
.
Later
I
ran
into
PyUnicodeUCS4_DecodeUTF16
issues
with
Python
and
for
that
I
had
to
install
python
with
â€”enable-unicode=ucs4
option
