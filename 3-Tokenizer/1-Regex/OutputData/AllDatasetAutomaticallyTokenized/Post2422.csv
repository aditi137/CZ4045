I
would
like
some
information
about
how
the
code
gets
executed
when
a
Flask
application
is
deployed
(
say
","
with
gunicorn
)
.
For
example
","
suppose
I
have
the
following
in
views.py
:
When
does
foo
get
sorted
?
Only
once
when
the
server
starts
?
Every
time
there's
a
request
?
Something
else
?
The
presence
of
before_first_request
and
before_request
in
the
documentation
seem
to
offer
clues
","
but
I
can't
understand
the
problems
they're
meant
to
solve
until
I
understand
how
exactly
the
code
is
run
on
a
server
.
Can
you
explain
step-by-step
(
e.g
.
First
A
happens
","
and
then
B
","
then
C
)
or
point
to
an
on-line
resource
","
please
?
