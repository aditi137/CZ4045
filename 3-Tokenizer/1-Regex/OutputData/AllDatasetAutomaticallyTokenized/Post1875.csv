I'm
looking
for
a
solution
with
this
small
selenium
script
.
The
problem
happens
when
on
the
list
there
are
more
than
1
occurence
of
the
text
.
i'm
looking
for
in
with
xpath
command
[
contains()
.
Then
script
stops
.
As
you
see
on
my
script
tried
to
use
css
selector
(
un-commented
)
but
it
not
valid
.
I
have
seen
some
solution
with
regular
expression
with
css
selector
with
^
and
$
but
i
don't
how
it
works
.
EDIT
:
I'm
looking
to
select
only
the
third
element
""""
LIT
""""
as
you
see
there
are
thee
times
LIT
inside
de
list
which
block
the
script
.
Here
is
the
snippet
html
and
here
my
code
