I
fuzzy
matched
a
list
of
movie
titles
and
compiled
them
into
another
list
of
each
comparison
along
with
the
match
values
:
I
want
to
add
up
the
match
values
for
each
title
so
that
I
get
output
like
this
:
I
have
tried
several
implementations
utilizing
slices
but
it's
ugly
.
(
Not
my
exact
code
but
this
is
the
ugliness
)
:
what
is
a
more
efficient
way
to
accomplish
this
?
