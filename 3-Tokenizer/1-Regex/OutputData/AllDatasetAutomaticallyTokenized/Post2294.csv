I'm
using
a
platform
that
","
when
you
upload
pdf's
to
it
","
converts
the
pdf
with
the
base64
encode
in
Python
.
Then
it
stores
the
binary
string
in
the
database
.
Now
I
want
to
decode
the
strings
and
write
them
to
a
local
folder
","
so
I
thought
to
use
the
'
with
open
'
structure
and
pass
it
the
b
parameter
for
binary
and
then
it
should
create
test.pdf
based
of
my
decoded
string
and
write
it
to
my
desktop
?
Yet
this
yields
no
results
","
what
am
I
doing
wrong
here
?
EDIT
:
Example
binary
string
in
database
:
""""
65
/
658e9014babd33786821f3130c5f3a1cc1322ddf
""""
So
I'm
assuming
it
starts
after
the
'
/
'
mark
?
