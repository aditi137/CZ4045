I'm
trying
to
build
a
Service
class
that
holds
the
Registry
instances
.
The
Registry
and
Service
classes
are
the
following
;
What
I
currently
want
is
after
the
boot
function
is
called
","
The
registry
functions
should
be
accessible
from
Service
class
statically
without
defining
functions
in
Service
class
.
So
","
after
booting
with
the
following
code
","
I
want
to
use
get
function
.
NOTE
:
Config
object
is
an
extension
of
Registry
I've
tried
__getattr__
magic
method
but
it
doesn't
work
on
static
.
I've
tried
__call__
but
after
that
I
need
to
call
Service()
.
get()
which
is
not
that
I
want
.
So
","
is
it
possible
to
make
this
happen
in
python
?
I
don't
want
to
redefine
class
methods
in
Service
layer
.
NOTE
:
In
PHP
","
there
exists
__callStatic()
function
that
does
exactly
that
I
want
.
However
","
I
can't
find
an
implementation
on
python
.
