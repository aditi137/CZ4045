In
python
","
returning
multiple
variables
corresponds
to
returning
any
iterable
","
so
there's
no
practical
difference
between
returning
a
list
or
""""
multiple
variables
""""
:
The
only
difference
between
these
two
functions
is
that
f
returns
a
tuple
","
and
g
returns
a
list
-
which
is
indifferent
","
if
you
use
multiple
assignment
on
the
return
value
.
