I'd
like
to
get
the
hostname
in
Google
App
Engine
when
running
dev_appserver.py
","
because
GAE
is
making
a
request
of
an
external
server
and
that
server
needs
to
know
where
to
send
its
response
.
Unfortunately
","
the
canonical
Python
way
doesn't
seem
to
work
","
being
:
The
socket
library
doesn't
work
in
GAE
.
Also
","
Are
both
localhost
.
How
could
one
get
the
IP
that
an
external
server
would
connect
to
GAE
?
Thanks
for
reading
