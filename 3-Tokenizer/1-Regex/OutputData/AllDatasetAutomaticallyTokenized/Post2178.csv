I
read
that
unit-test
is
a
brilliant
feature
to
write
better
code
and
assert
that
the
features
of
some
target
code
stay
the
same
.
So
I
wanted
to
use
it
...
I
am
using
Anaconda
on
my
Linux
machine
.
I
started
using
pytest
by
working
through
the
manual's
starter
guide
on
their
homepage
.
After
a
successful
installation
there
appears
a
first
(
unintended
)
error
:
I
would
like
to
understand
where
this
stupid
error
comes
from
and
how
I
can
resolve
it
.
Is
the
problem
that
I
execute
the
program
py.test
without
any
filename
and
that
there
is
no
file
called
__init.py__
?
OK
I
am
feeling
really
stupid
by
asking
this
question
but
please
take
the
question
serious
since
I
found
no
hint
in
the
world
wide
web
.
