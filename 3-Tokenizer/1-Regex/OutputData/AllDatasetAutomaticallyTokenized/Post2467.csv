I
have
a
class
called
Job
which
has
a
logger
and
jobs
go
off
do
something
and
logs
via
job.logger.info()
but
when
i
have
multiple
jobs
i.e.
thousands
","
it's
throwing
error
I
thought
every
time
I
logged
something
","
it
would
open
then
close
the
file
as
I
have
overwritten
emit()
Is
there
a
pattern
/
ways
to
have
thousands
of
loggers
?
