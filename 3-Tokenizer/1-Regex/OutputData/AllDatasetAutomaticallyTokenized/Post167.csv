Part
of
learning
a
new
programming
language
is
learning
to
read
code
in
that
language
.
A
crutch
like
this
may
make
it
easier
to
read
your
own
code
","
but
it's
going
to
impede
the
process
of
learning
how
to
read
anyone
else's
Python
code
.
I
really
think
you'd
be
better
off
getting
rid
of
the
end
of
block
comments
and
getting
used
to
normal
Python
.
