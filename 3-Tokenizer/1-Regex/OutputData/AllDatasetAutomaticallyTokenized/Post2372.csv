It's
not
working
because
you
are
only
extracting
one
word
after
you
split
:
due
to
[3]
.
Try
[
3
:
]
instead
.
Ah
","
but
that
still
won't
be
enough
","
because
you'll
get
a
list
of
lists
","
when
you
want
a
list
of
strings
.
So
you
also
need
to
use
join
.
Now
your
only
difficulty
is
dealing
with
irregular
street
addresses
","
e.g
.
people
who
don't
have
a
house
number
","
or
several
words
in
the
street
name
.
I
have
no
solution
for
that
!
