SQL
tables
represent
unordered
sets
.
So

there
is
no
correspondence
between
two
tables
based
on
position
.
Instead
","
let
me
assume
that
each
has
a
name
column

SQL
doesn't
really
do
optimization

so
you
need
to
do
this
in
a
brute

way
.
That
is

generate
all
the
combinations
and
then
choose
the
minimum
value
.
That

essentially
a
cross

you
want
the
