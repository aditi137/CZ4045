First
of
all
the
\
u2122
is
only
the
ASCII-friendly
representation
of
the
â„¢
unicode
character
.
If
you
print()
the
string
","
you'll
see
that
character
instead
of
that
.
So
no
worries
!
then
","
your
code
does
not
work
for
me
:
is
returning
a
list
","
which
makes
it
impossible
to
do
:
so
I
don't
get
how
you're
getting
a
result
.
And
even
if
it
was
working
","
there's
something
you
don't
get
with
XPath
","
it's
that
/
/
makes
the
search
start
at
the
root
of
the
document
","
which
why
you're
getting
every
content
of
a
a
tag
within
a
td
tag
","
not
the
one
inside
the
tr
you're
in
.
On
the
contrary
","
if
you
use
a
relative
xpath
","
the
following
would
work
:
But
thing
is
that
doing
so
is
too
generic
and
you
won't
be
able
to
keep
element
in
the
order
of
interest
.
And
sadly
","
there's
no
automatic
way
to
get
that
interesting
stuff
out
of
it
.
Then
You
need
to
take
the
HTML
","
and
see
that
you
want
the
alt
of
the
image
in
that
td
","
that
you
want
to
take
the
content
of
the
span
in
that
other
one
:
The
following
is
getting
the
values
of
interest
from
the
document
you
linked
:
which
gets
all
the
fields
.
In
the
end
","
to
make
it
easily
reuseable
","
here's
what
I'd
do
:
and
for
the
first
enzime
","
here's
the
result
:
HTH
