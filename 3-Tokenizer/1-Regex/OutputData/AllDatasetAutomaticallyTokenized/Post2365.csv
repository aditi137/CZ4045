I
am
using
a
3rd
party
python
library
that
creates
.
svg's
(
specifically
for
evolutionary
trees
)
which
has
a
render
function
for
tree
objects
.
What
I
want
is
the
svg
in
string
form
that
I
can
edit
.
Currently
I
save
the
svg
and
read
the
file
as
follows
:
This
works
","
but
is
it
possible
to
use
a
tempfile
instead
?
So
far
I
have
:
Can
anyone
explain
why
this
doesn't
work
and
/
or
how
I
could
do
this
without
creating
a
file
(
which
I
just
have
to
delete
later
)
.
The
svg_string
I
go
on
to
edit
for
use
in
a
django
application
.
EDIT
:
Importantly
","
the
render
function
can
also
be
used
to
create
other
filetypes
e.g
.
.
png
-
so
the
.
svg
extension
needs
to
be
specified
.
