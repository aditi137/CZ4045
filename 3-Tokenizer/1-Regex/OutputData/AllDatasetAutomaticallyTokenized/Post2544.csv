I
have
a
function
which
takes
a
count
and
a
string
as
input
.
It
should
return
a
list
of
all
words
in
that
string
of
length
count
","
and
greater
.
Python
however
doesn't
recognise
my
variable
and
returns
an
empty
list
.
How
do
I
pass
in
the
variable
'
count
'
so
that
the
function
returns
words
of
count
and
longer
?
