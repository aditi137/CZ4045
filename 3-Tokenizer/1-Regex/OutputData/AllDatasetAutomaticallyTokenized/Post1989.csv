I
am
trying
to
make
a
very
simple
application
that
allows
for
people
to
define
their
own
little
python
scripts
within
the
application
.
I
want
to
execute
the
code
in
a
new
process
to
make
it
easy
to
kill
later
.
Unfortunately
","
Python
keeps
giving
me
the
following
error
:
My
code
is
posted
below
What
am
I
missing
?
Is
there
something
wrong
with
my
user_input_string
?
With
my
compile
options
?
Any
help
would
be
appreciated
.
