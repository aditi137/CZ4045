I'm
only
a
newbie
to
Python
","
but
here's
my
approach
.
There
","
my
proposed
name
for
the
function
too
.
:
-
)
It's
important
to
recalculate
disp
every
time
","
in
case
the
daylight-savings
value
changes
or
the
like
.
(
The
conversion
back
to
tuple
is
required
for
Jython
.
CPython
doesn't
seem
to
require
it
.
)
This
is
super
ick
","
because
time.gmtime
sets
the
DST
flag
to
false
","
always
.
I
hate
the
code
","
though
.
There's
got
to
be
a
better
way
to
do
it
.
And
there
are
probably
some
corner
cases
that
I
haven't
got
","
yet
.
