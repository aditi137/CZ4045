I
have
some
data
that
can
be
parsed
using
the
OneorMore
function
from
pyparsing
.
Something
like
","
where
bar
and
foo
are
2
parsers
.
The
problem
with
this
function
is
that
everytime
that
OneorMore
match
foo
and
bar
parsers
in
the
data
stream
","
the
corresponding
values
associated
with
the
keys
""""
foo
""""
and
""""
bar
""""
are
updated.But
","
how
can
I
accumulate
all
the
matched
values
of
foo
and
bar
?
I'm
trying
to
implement
something
like
the
many1
monadic
parser
in
Haskell
","
saving
the
result
of
parsing
foo
and
bar
in
an
Algebraic
Data
type
","
like
How
can
I
do
this
in
python
?
