print
needs
to
encode
the
string
before
sending
to
stdout
but
when
the
process
is
in
a
pipe
","
the
value
of
sys.stdout.encoding
is
None
","
so
print
receives
an
unicode
object
and
then
it
tries
to
encode
this
object
using
the
ascii
codec
-
-
if
you
have
non-ASCII
characters
in
this
unicode
object
","
an
exception
will
be
raised
.
You
can
solve
this
problem
encoding
all
unicode
objects
before
sending
it
to
the
standard
output
(
but
you'll
need
to
guess
which
codec
to
use
)
.
