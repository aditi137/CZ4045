I
have
a
legacy
code
segment
that
always
encode('utf-8')
for
me
when
I
pass
in
an
unicode
string
(
directly
from
database
)
","
is
there
a
way
to
change
unicode
string
to
other
format
to
allow
it
to
be
encoded
to
'
utf-8
'
again
without
getting
an
error
","
since
I
am
not
allowed
to
change
the
legacy
code
segment
.
I've
tried
decoding
it
first
but
it
returns
this
error
If
I
leave
the
unicode
string
as
is
it
returns
If
I
change
the
legacy
code
to
not
encode('utf-8')
it
works
","
but
this
is
not
a
viable
option
Edit
:
Here
is
the
code
snippet
For
some
reason
if
I
skip
#
2
I
don't
get
the
error
that
I
mentioned
above
","
I
double
check
the
type
for
the
string
","
it
seems
like
both
is
unicode
","
and
both
is
the
same
character
","
but
the
code
I
am
working
on
does
not
allow
me
to
encode
or
decode
to
utf-8
","
while
the
same
character
in
some
snippet
allows
me
to
do
that
.
