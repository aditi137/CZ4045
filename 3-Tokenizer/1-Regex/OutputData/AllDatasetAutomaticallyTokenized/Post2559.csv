I
was
playing
around
with
this
some
time
ago
and
seem
to
remember
that
in
my
PATH
variable
in
Windows
(
assuming
Windows
)
-
the
PATH
variable
will
be
read
such
that
the
first
python
key
is
taken
as
the
default
.
So
in
Win
10
","
I
pushed
the
one
I
want
to
the
very
top
of
the
list
and
that
worked
for
me
.
