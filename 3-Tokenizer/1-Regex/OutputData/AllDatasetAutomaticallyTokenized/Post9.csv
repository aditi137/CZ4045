Garbage
collection
is
faster
(
more
time
efficient
)
than
reference
counting
","
if
you
have
enough
memory
.
For
example
","
a
copying
gc
traverses
the
""""
live
""""
objects
and
copies
them
to
a
new
space
","
and
can
reclaim
all
the
""""
dead
""""
objects
in
one
step
by
marking
a
whole
memory
region
.
This
is
very
efficient
","
if
you
have
enough
memory
.
Generational
collections
use
the
knowledge
that
""""
most
objects
die
young
""""
;
often
only
a
few
percent
of
objects
have
to
be
copied
.
[
This
is
also
the
reason
why
gc
can
be
faster
than
malloc
/
free
]
Reference
counting
is
much
more
space
efficient
than
garbage
collection
","
since
it
reclaims
memory
the
very
moment
it
gets
unreachable
.
This
is
nice
when
you
want
to
attach
finalizers
to
objects
(
e.g
.
to
close
a
file
once
the
File
object
gets
unreachable
)
.
A
reference
counting
system
can
work
even
when
only
a
few
percent
of
the
memory
is
free
.
But
the
management
cost
of
having
to
increment
and
decrement
counters
upon
each
pointer
assignment
cost
a
lot
of
time
","
and
some
kind
of
garbage
collection
is
still
needed
to
reclaim
cycles
.
So
the
trade-off
is
clear
:
if
you
have
to
work
in
a
memory-constrained
environment
","
or
if
you
need
precise
finalizers
","
use
reference
counting
.
If
you
have
enough
memory
and
need
the
speed
","
use
garbage
collection
.
