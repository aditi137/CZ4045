You
should
split
your
question
into
two
","
however
","
for
the
first
question
","
the
exception
is
raised
because
there
is
no
JOB_ID
environment
variable
set
in
your
Python
program's
environment
.
Firstly
you
can
set
it
on
the
command
line
when
invoking
Python
:
or
you
can
set
the
variable
in
you
shell's
environment
:
Either
of
these
will
fix
the
problem
","
however
","
you
should
code
more
defensively
by
catching
the
exception
","
or
by
using
os.environ.get('JOB_ID')
which
will
not
throw
an
exception
if
the
environment
variable
is
not
set
.
For
the
second
question
you
should
reask
it
as
new
question
and
in
it
explain
more
accurately
which
module
is
being
used
.
