So
I've
had
a
good
look
around
","
and
this
is
the
closest
I
could
find
to
what
I
need
to
do
:
http://bytes.com/topic/python/answers/23100-windows-dialog-box-removal
But
it's
only
part
of
it
.
So
I
have
a
script
that
needs
to
run
fully
automated
.
Currently
it's
being
stopped
by
a
Windows
dialog
box
prompting
the
user
to
click
'
OK
'
.
Is
it
possible
to
register
some
sort
of
handler
that
when
a
dialog
box
opens
is
fired
and
selects
the
'
OK
'
option
for
it
?
Any
ideas
how
to
do
this
/
where
I
can
get
futher
info
on
it
?
NOTE
:
My
goal
isn't
just
to
keep
the
code
going
","
a
requirement
is
to
select
'
OK
'
on
the
dialog
box
before
continuing
.
