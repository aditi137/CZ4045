The
inner
loop
logic
is
wrong
but
particularly
","
this
line
:
You
are
changing
the
image
variable
in-place
","
but
you
seemed
to
forget
the
row
variable
r
.
So
right
now
","
you
are
changing
rows
.
And
your
negative
slicing
is
a
bit
off
.
For
c=0
","
you'll
get
image
[
-
3:0
]
and
this
is
not
a
valid
slice
and
it
will
return
[]
.
But
judging
from
your
code
you
don't
mean
to
change
image
in-place
","
you
rather
want
to
create
new_image
.
What
you
should
be
doing
is
inserting
slices
at
the
end
of
new_row
:
By
the
way
","
you
can
also
change
the
image
in-place
","
but
be
careful
.
As
you
are
passing
a
list
","
you
should
copy
it
before
changing
so
that
original
is
unchanged
.
Here
is
that
version
:
This
can
also
be
done
with
a
list
comprehension
in
single
line
","
but
it
will
be
less
readable
.
If
you
like
","
here
is
how
you
can
do
it
:
