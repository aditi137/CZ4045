I
want
to
revisit
the
question
as
specified
in
PYTHONPATH
vs
.
sys.path
.
Basically
it
is
concerned
with
developing
a
package
like
:
Assuming
script.py
does
from
package.lib
import foo
it
does
work
when
calling
:
from
the
directory
where
setup.py
is
sitting
","
but
not
when
calling
(
on
windows
","
CPython
2.7
)
:
In
first
case
when
printing
sys.path
first
entry
is
'
'
","
but
in
second
case
the
first
entry
is
the
absolute
path
to
where
script.py
is
sitting
.
And
of
course
in
that
case
it
does
not
know
anything
about
package
and
the
import fails
.
This
will
also
be
the
case
when
double-clicking
in
Explorer
.
The
original
stackoverflow
question
recommends
package
installation
by
setup.py
develop
.
However
","
in
current
setuptools
3.5
(
I
am
aware+confused
of
the
distutils
/
setuptools
renaming
)
this
option
is
not
even
documented
(
I
have
setuptools
3.4.x
","
but
did
not
try
it
)
.
Can
anyone
point
out
to
me
what
the
recommended
(
""""
…
only
obvious
way
to
do
it
…
""""
)
procedere
is
on
windows
(
for
CPython
2.7
but
also
having
Python
3
in
mind
)
for
double-clicking
the
file
and
having
it
work
.
Relative
imports
?
