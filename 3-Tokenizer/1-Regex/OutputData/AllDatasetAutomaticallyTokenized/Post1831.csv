Confession
:
this
is
for
a
class
.
I
am
trying
to
generate
all
subsets
of
length
1
-
length(full set)
","
but
they
must
be
in
order
.
So
","
with
an
input
of
(
4
","
2
)
","
valid
results
would
be
(
4
)
","
(
4
","
2
)
","
and
(
2
)
.
Would
not
be
(
4
","
4
)
(
2
","
2
)
or
(
2
","
4
)
eta
(
4
","
2
","
2
)
should
return
(
2
","
2
)
as
well
.
Length
is
not
pre-determined
.
What
I
have
right
now
:
This
is
partially
obtained
by
a
given
function
.
I
don't
understand
how
Python
is
iterating
over
an
empty
set
in
that
2nd
""""
for
""""
loop
.
This
current
code
outputs
(
4
","
4
)
","
(
2
","
2
)
","
and
(
2
","
4
)
in
addition
to
the
""""
right
""""
answers
.
I'm
getting
hung
up
on
the
nested
loops
and
keeping
track
of
multiple
counters
and
having
different
lengths
for
the
desired
output
.
I
have
also
tried
this
:
