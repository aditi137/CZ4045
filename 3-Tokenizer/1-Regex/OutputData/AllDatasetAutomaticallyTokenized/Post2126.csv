My
code
is
trying
to
read
all
log
files
throughout
the
specified
directory
in
rootDir
and
write
certain
pieces
of
information
from
that
log
file
to
an
outputFile
The
issue
I'm
having
is
searchObj_Archive_date.group()
","
fullpath
","
zDiscsVar
","
zCopiesVar
","
and
searchObj_Year_3or6.group()
aren't
being
read
into
my
file
from
certain
lines
within
the
log
files
.
This
happens
for
only
about
10
%
of
the
total
outputted
lines
of
text
","
so
I'm
confused
why
it's
only
happening
some
of
the
time
","
so
instead
of
E:\filepath\text.txt
|
5
/
23
/
2015
12:00
|
C:\anotherFilePath\text.txt
|
23
|
23
|
5Year
","
I
get
E:\filepath\text.txt
|
|
|
|
|
Any
insight
as
to
why
this
error
is
occuring
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
My
code
is
below
:
After
doing
some
researched
","
I
found
that
what's
causing
my
error
is
that
whenever
a
line
has
a
comma
","
in
it
.
It
stops
reading
the
line
at
that
comma
and
skips
to
the
next
line
","
does
anybody
know
a
workaround
to
this
?
An
example
of
my
input
text
that's
giving
me
problems
:

Adding
file
D:\fp\fp1\fp2\text
","
text
","
text.txt
Normally
these
lines
don't
have
commas
","
so
does
anyone
know
of
a
way
to
handle
commas
when
reading
in
lines
of
text
?
