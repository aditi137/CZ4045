There
is
nothing
wrong
with
your
current
approach
.
time_diff
is
written
to
once
only
and
then
all
future
accesses
are
reads
.
It
effect
it
is
a
module
wide
constant
.
You
run
into
problems
with
shared
global
state
when
you
have
multiple
threads
accessing
an
object
and
at
least
one
of
the
threads
is
writing
.
That's
not
happening
here
and
you
have
nothing
to
be
concerned
about
.
