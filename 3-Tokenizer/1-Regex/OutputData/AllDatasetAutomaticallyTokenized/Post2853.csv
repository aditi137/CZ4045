We
can
use
break
statement
inside
if
statement
for
termination
.
Instead
of
break
we
can
write
os.exit
or
sys.exit
os._exit
calls
the
C
function
_exit()
which
does
an
immediate
program
termination
.
Note
the
statement
""""
can
never
return
""""
.
sys.exit()
is
identical
to
raise
SystemExit()
.
It
raises
a
Python
exception
which
may
be
caught
by
the
caller
.
