I
developed
a
GUI
with
wxGlade
and
its
still
working
.
But
to
start
the
GUI
-
I
coded
a
script
with
some
choices
.
So
everything
works
but
when
I
push
the
red
button
with
the
""""
x
""""
to
close
the
window
-
the
application
doesnÂ´t
stop
.
I
made
a
method
","
called
by
a
separate
exit
button
","
which
calls
an
exit-function
in
my
script
.
But
normally
the
users
are
using
the
close
button
(
red
button
with
X
)
so
my
method
is
not
being
used
to
close
the
window
and
the
window
doesn't
get
closed
ultimately
.
This
is
the
exit-function
.
How
can
I
use
this
function
with
the
red
button
with
the
""""
x
""""
?
