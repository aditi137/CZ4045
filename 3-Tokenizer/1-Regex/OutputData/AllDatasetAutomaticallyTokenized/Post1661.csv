I'm
trying
to
plot
a
surface
over
several
points
it
should
look
like
a
deformed
sphere
.
I
used
the
scatter
function
and
plotted
the
points
","
but
the
surface
function
is
not
working
(
the
window
is
empty
)
.
To
plot
the
surface
","
I
think
i
need
a
mesh
function
.
I
try
ed
to
mash
x
","
y
","
z
but
it
was
not
working
.
How
i
can
generate
the
code
","
to
put
a
surface
over
my
points
?
.
Thanks
for
helping
me
.
I
have
the
points
xyz
stored
in
a
list
.
They
are
describing
a
deformed
sphere
and
i
have
to
plot
somthing
like
this
