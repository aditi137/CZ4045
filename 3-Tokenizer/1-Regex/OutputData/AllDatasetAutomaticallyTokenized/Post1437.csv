I've
been
trying
to
wrap
text
for
long
labels
in
my
code
.
I
tried
the
textwrap
method
suggested
earlier
here
","
but
my
code
defines
yticklabels
through
an
array
imported
from
a
csv
using
the
pyplot.setp()
method
.
I'm
using
tight_layout()
for
the
formatting
otherwise
.
So
the
question
is
-
is
there
a
way
to
wrap
the
really
long
y
labels
to
newlines
easily
?
Here
is
some
sample
code
that
I'd
like
a
fix
for
:
This
plots
something
like
this
I'd
like
the
labels
to
go
to
newlines
after
a
fixed
width
.
Any
ideas
?
