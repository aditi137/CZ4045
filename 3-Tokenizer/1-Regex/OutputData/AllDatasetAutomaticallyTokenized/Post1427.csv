I
have
a
NumPy
array
that
stores
the
information
of
a
signal
.
In
the
code
below
I
have
just
created
it
from
random
numbers
for
convenience
.
Now
I
need
to
select
positions
from
the
signal
array
","
based
on
criteria
.
Again
","
I
have
simplified
the
criteria
below
","
for
sake
of
brevity
.
I
am
trying
to
store
those
positions
by
appending
them
to
an
empty
NumPy
array
called
positions
.
I
know
that
my
use
of
the
NumPy.append()
function
must
be
wrong
.
I
tried
to
debug
it
","
but
I
cannot
find
the
bug
.
What
am
I
doing
wrong
?
EDIT
:
I
actually
need
this
to
run
in
a
for
loop
","
since
my
condition
in
the
if()
is
a
mathematical
expression
that
will
be
changed
according
to
some
rule
(
that
would
be
way
to
complicated
to
post
here
)
if
the
condition
is
met
.
