This
is
a
copy
of
my
Json
file
.
How
can
I
loop
through
the
json
and
make
a
list
/
or
print
a
particular
key
(
example
:
""""
hteamName
""""
)
","
which
is
similar
in
different
arrays
but
with
different
values
.
From
a
previous
question
","
I
got
some
codes
that
could
iterate
through
a
nested
dictionary
","
but
it
only
finds
unique
keys
with
unique
values
.
