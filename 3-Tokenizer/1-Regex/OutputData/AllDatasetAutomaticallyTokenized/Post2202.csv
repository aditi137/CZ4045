I
am
pulling
a
chunk
of
data
within
a
range
of
time
.
It
is
pulling
date
and
times
from
column
recvd_dttm
.
It
takes
all
the
data
starting
from
a
year
ago
.
I
want
to
modify
it
so
that
it
can
pull
a
month
or
a
day
","
but
pd.DateOffset(months=1)
is
giving
a
KeyError:1
error
.
I
get
the
same
error
if
I
change
it
to
days=7
.
But
it
works
just
fine
with
years=1
.
What
is
going
on
here
?
EDIT
:
The
problem
was
coming
from
elsewhere
in
the
code
!
