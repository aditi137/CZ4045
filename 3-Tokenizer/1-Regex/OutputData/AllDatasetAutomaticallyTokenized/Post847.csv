I
am
learning
PyQt
by
playing
with
examples
.
In
this
case
","
I'm
playing
with
the
webbrowser
example
that
is
located
at
\
Python26\Lib\site-packages\PyQt4\examples\activeqt\webbrowser
.
The
demo
does
something
really
odd
if
you
add
one
line
to
set
the
icon
text
property
of
a
QAction
.
Here's
a
code
sample
of
the
change
I
tried
:
One
time
I
tried
it
","
and
the
entire
toolbar
went
blank
.
I
can't
reproduce
that
","
now
I
have
no
effect
from
that
one
line
change
.
What
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
what
to
do
to
the
QAction
so
that
the
toolbar
has
text
on
the
button
beside
the
image
","
or
can
it
be
done
at
all
like
this
?
Is
there
some
other
way
to
make
the
toolbar
have
some
text
plus
an
icon
?
