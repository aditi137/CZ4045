I
have
a
column
called
maturity_dt
filled
with
datetime
objects
in
my
dataframe
df
","
and
I
am
just
trying
to
select
only
the
rows
in
the
column
which
have
a
maturity_dt
in
August
or
February
.
So
","
I
am
trying
to
delete
all
the
rows
that
do
not
correspond
with
these
months
dynamically
using
the
code
below
.
However
","
I
get
the
error
IndexError
:
index
109235
is
out
of
bounds
for
axis
0
with
size
44681
despite
using
reset_index
","
so
I
am
wondering
if
there
is
another
way
to
delete
rows
dynamically
.
Thank
You
