You
have
a
problem
which
can
be
solved
several
ways
.
I
think
you
should
consider
using
regular
expression
(
what
perl
is
doing
in
your
example
)
directly
from
Python
.
Regular
expressions
are
in
the
re
module
.
An
example
would
be
:
(
I
would
prefer
using
$
instead
of
'
\
n
'
for
line
endings
","
because
line
endings
are
different
between
operational
systems
and
file
encodings
)
If
you
want
to
call
bash
commands
from
inside
Python
","
you
could
use
:
Where
command
is
the
bash
command
.
I
use
it
all
the
time
","
because
some
operations
are
better
to
perform
in
bash
than
in
Python
.
Finally
","
if
you
want
to
extract
the
numbers
with
grep
","
use
the
-
o
option
","
which
prints
only
the
matched
part
.
