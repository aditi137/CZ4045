When
you
want
to
use
a
module
in
another
one
","
you
have
to
import it
and
so
use
import your_module
.
You
have
to
type
your_module.foo()
if
you
want
to
use
a
method
inside
it
.
With
the
instruction
from
your_module
import attr1
","
foo1
","
[
...
]
you
are
modifying
the
module's
global
variables
","
so
that
you
can
use
attr1
or
the
method
foo1
as
if
they
were
in
your
module
.
A
concrete
example
is
:
if
you
want
to
use
the
math
module
","
you
type
import math
and
when
you
want
to
use
the
constant
pi
you
type
math.pi
","
but
if
you
are
sure
there
will
be
no
clash
with
the
other
names
","
you'll
type
from
math
import pi
and
you
will
use
the
constant
pi
as
if
you
declared
it
in
your
module
.
