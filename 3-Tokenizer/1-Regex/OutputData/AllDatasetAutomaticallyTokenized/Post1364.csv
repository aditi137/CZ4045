I
am
making
a
pyramid
webapp
running
in
apache
webserver
using
mod_wsgi
.
Is
there
anyway
I
could
make
user
session
never
timed
out
?
(
The
idea
is
so
that
once
user
logged
in
","
the
system
will
never
kicked
them
out
unless
they
logged
out
themselves
)
.
I
cant
find
any
information
regarding
this
in
apache
","
mod_wsgi
or
pyramid
documentation
.
Thanks
!
