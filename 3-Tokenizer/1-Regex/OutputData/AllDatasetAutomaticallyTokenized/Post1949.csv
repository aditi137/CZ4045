XML
documents
must
have
a
single
root
element
;
otherwise
","
they
are
not
well-formed
","
and
are

not
XML
.
Conformant
parsers
cannot

XML
""""
.
When
you
construct
your
single
XML
document
out
of
multiple
documents
","
simply
wrap
the
disparate
root
elements
in
a
single
root
element
.
Then
you'll
be
able
to
use
standard
parsers
such
as
lxml
.
