Edit
:
I
wrote
this
before
reading
the
update
to
the
original
question
.
See
my
other
answer
for
a
better
answer
to
the
updated
question
.
I
will
leave
this
as
is
as
a
warning
against
being
the
fastest
gun
in
the
west
=
)
Over
a
decade
ago
","
when
I
was
learning
the
ways
of
the
Computer
","
the
Old
Wise
Men
With
Beards
explained
how
C
and
C
+
+
are
the
tools
of
the
industry
.
No
one
used
Pascal
and
only
the
foolhardy
would
risk
their
companies
with
assembler
.
And
of
course
","
no
one
would
even
mention
the
awful
slow
ugly
thing
called
Java
.
It
will
not
be
a
tool
for
serious
business
.
So
.
Um
.
Replace
the
languages
in
the
above
story
and
perhaps
you
can
predict
the
future
.
Perhaps
you
can't
.
Point
is
","
Java
will
not
be
the
Last
Programming
Language
ever
and
also
you
will
most
likely
switch
employers
as
well
.
The
future
is
charging
at
you
24
hours
per
day
.
Be
prepared
.
Learning
new
languages
is
good
for
you
.
Also
","
in
some
cases
it
can
give
you
bragging
rights
for
a
long
time
.
My
first
university
course
was
in
Scheme
.
So
when
people
talk
to
me
about
the
new
language
du
jour
","
my
response
is
something
like
""""
First-class
functions
?
That's
so
last
century
.
""""
And
of
course
","
you
get
more
stuff
done
with
a
high-level
language
.
