As
of
3.3
","
time.clock()
is
deprecated
","
and
it's
suggested
to
use
time.process_time()
or
time.perf_counter()
instead
.
Previously
in
2.7
","
according
to
the
time
module
docs
:
time.clock()
On
Unix
","
return
the
current
processor
time
as
a
floating
point
number
expressed
in
seconds
.
The
precision
","
and
in
fact
the
very
definition
of
the
meaning
of
“
processor
time
”
","
depends
on
that
of
the
C
function
of
the
same
name
","
but
in
any
case
","
this
is
the
function
to
use
for
benchmarking
Python
or
timing
algorithms
.
On
Windows
","
this
function
returns
wall-clock
seconds
elapsed
since
the
first
call
to
this
function
","
as
a
floating
point
number
","
based
on
the
Win32
function
QueryPerformanceCounter()
.
The
resolution
is
typically
better
than
one
microsecond
.
Additionally
","
there
is
the
timeit
module
for
benchmarking
code
snippets
.
