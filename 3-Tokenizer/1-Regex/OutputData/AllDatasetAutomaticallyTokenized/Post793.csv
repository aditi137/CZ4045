After
using
Skype4py
on
64bit
Linux
system
I
got
similar
results
(
segfault
)
.
Someone
on
Skype
forums
suggested
to
add
to
the
script
","
to
see
what
is
going
on
","
but
it
didn't
help
much
.
And
the
weird
part
is
that
it
sometimes
works
.
I
tried
starting
the
script
many
times
","
sometimes
it
starts
but
segfaults
at
some
later
point
.
Anyway
","
tested
the
""""
Transport='x11
'
""""
thing
that
Steven
mentioned
","
and
it
seems
like
it
fixes
it
.
