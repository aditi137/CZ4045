I
am
using
the
below
python
code
to
read
data
from
a
url
.
The
curl
command
from
unix
works
.
But
when
i
try
to
store
the
returned
json
in
a
python
variable
","
it
is
always
blank
.
Any
pointers
?
I
do
see
the
output
on
the
Spyder
Console
","
but
never
in
the
variable
.
EDIT
:
My
environment
details
.
I
am
on
Windows
7
","
executing
the
command
from
Anaconda
Spyder
IDE
.
