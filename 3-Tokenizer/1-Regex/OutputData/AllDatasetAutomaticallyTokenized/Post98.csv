here
is
a
ready-to-use
solution
that
works
for
me
;
written
for
Python
3.1
(
when
backporting
to
Py2.x
","
take
special
care
of
the
bytes
/
Unicode
text
distinctions
)
.
your
single
point
of
access
is
the
method
DRWHO.whois()
","
which
expects
a
domain
name
to
be
passed
in
;
it
will
then
try
to
resolve
the
name
using
the
provider
configured
as
DRWHO.whois_providers
[
'
*
'
]
(
a
more
complete
solution
could
differentiate
providers
according
to
the
top
level
domain
)
.
DRWHO.whois()
will
return
a
dictionary
with
a
single
entry
text
","
which
contains
the
response
text
sent
back
by
the
WHOIS
server
.
Again
","
a
more
complete
solution
would
then
try
and
parse
the
text
(
which
must
be
done
separately
for
each
provider
","
as
there
is
no
standard
format
)
and
return
a
more
structured
format
(
e.g
.
","
set
a
flag
available
which
specifies
whether
or
not
the
domain
looks
available
)
.
have
fun
!
