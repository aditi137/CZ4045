I
find
it
very
interesting
the
way
how
SQLAlchemy
constructing
query
strings
","
eg
:
As
far
as
I
can
see
","
there
applied
some
kind
of
Proxy
Pattern
.
In
my
small
project
I
need
to
make
similar
string
construction
using
OOP
approach
.
So
","
I
tried
to
reconstitute
this
behavior
.
Firstly
","
some
kind
of
object
","
one
of
plenty
similar
objects
:
All
methods
of
this
object
return
self
","
so
I
can
call
them
in
any
order
and
unlimited
number
of
times
.
Secondly
","
proxy
object
","
that
will
call
subject's
methods
if
it's
not
a
perform
method
","
which
calls
object
to
see
the
resulting
string
.
And
finally
:
What
can
you
say
about
this
implementation
?
Is
there
better
ways
to
make
the
desirable
amount
of
classes
that
would
make
such
a
string
cunstructing
with
the
same
syntax
?
PS
:
Sorry
for
my
english
","
it's
not
my
primary
language
.
