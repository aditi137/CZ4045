Let's
say
you
have
installed
the
package
'
django
'
.
import it
and
type
in
dir(django)
.
It
will
show
you
","
all
the
functions
and
attributes
with
that
module
.
Type
in
the
python
interpreter
-
You
can
do
the
same
thing
if
you
have
installed
mercurial
.
This
is
for
Snow
Leopard
.
But
I
think
it
should
work
in
general
as
well
.
