The

""""
Generates
an

sentences

""""
Clearly
it
does
so
by
choosing
alternative
expansions
in
the
order
they
are
listed
in
the
grammar
.
So
","
the
first
time
is
sees
an
NP
","
it
expands
it
with
the
rule
NP
->
NP
PP
.
It
now
has
another
NP
to
expand
","
which
it
also
expands
with
the
same
rule
...
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
","
or
rather
until
python's
limits
are
exceeded
.
To
fix
the
problem
with
the
grammar
you
provide
","
simply
reorder
your
first
two
NP
rules
so
that
the
recursive
rule
is
not
the
first
one
encountered
:
Do
it
like
this
and
the
generator
will
produce
lots
of
complete
sentences
for
you
to
examine
.
Note
that
the
corrected
grammar
is
still
recursive
","
hence
infinite
;
if
you
generate
a
large
enough
number
of
sentences
","
you
will
eventually
reach
the
same
recursion
depth
limit
.
