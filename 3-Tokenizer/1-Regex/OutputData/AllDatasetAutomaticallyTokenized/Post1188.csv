In
order
to
ensure
db
consistency
","
I
would
like
to
batch
set
the
type
of
the
last
column
of
every
table
to
TINYINT(1)
UNSIGNED
NOT
NULL
.
I
found
out
how
to
loop
through
tables
and
target
the
last
column
","
change
its
type
and
setting
the
NOT
NULL
flag
but
I
can't
find
how
to
set
the
UNSIGNED
flag
.
I
tried
both
:
but
I
get
a
TypeError
:
flag
is
read-only
.
I
also
tried
setting
the
dataType
property
of
the
column
to
a
reference
to
the
dataType
property
of
a
column
having
the
UNSIGNED
flag
(
defined
through
GUI
)
.
Finally
I
tried
:
but
it
returns
0
and
doesn't
change
anything
(
it
returns
1
if
I
remove
UNSIGNED
so
I
think
it
doesn't
work
with
flags
)
.
Is
there
any
way
to
change
column
flags
(
ie
:
UNSIGNED
","
ZEROFILL
)
using
a
Python
script
in
MySQL
Workbench
?
