As
others
have
noted
","
distutils.sysconfig
has
the
relevant
settings
:
...
though
the
default
site.py
does
something
a
bit
more
crude
","
paraphrased
below
:
(
it
also
adds
${sys.prefix
}
/
lib
/
site-python
and
adds
both
paths
for
sys.exec_prefix
as
well
","
should
that
constant
be
different
)
.
That
said
","
what's
the
context
?
You
shouldn't
be
messing
with
your
site-packages
directly
;
setuptools
/
distutils
will
work
for
installation
","
and
your
program
may
be
running
in
a
virtualenv
where
your
pythonpath
is
completely
user-local
","
so
it
shouldn't
assume
use
of
the
system
site-packages
directly
either
.
