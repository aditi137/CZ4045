Consider
True
is
1
and
0
is
False
.
Since
a
is
set
to
False
(
a=False
in
first
statement
of
code
)
","
the
first
part
'
a==True
'
i.e.
0
=
=
1
will
return
0
(
False
)
.
Then
remaining
will
be
False
or
True
since
'
a==True
'
is
False
.
So
it
will
be
like
0
or
1
(
False
or
True
)
.
We
know
that
0
AND
0
=
0
1
AND
0
=
0
1
AND
1
=
1
0
OR
0
=
0
0
OR
1
=
1
1
OR
1
=
1
So
in
your
case
","
0
OR
1
will
result
to
1
i.e.
True
.
Summary
:
That's
why
""""
Hell
yeah
","
I'm
genius
""""
will
be
printed
.
