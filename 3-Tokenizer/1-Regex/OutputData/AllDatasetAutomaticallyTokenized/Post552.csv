I
found
an
explanation
here
by
googling
for
""""
windows
ini
""""
""""
default
section
""""
.
Summary
:
whatever
you
put
in
the
[DEFAULT]
section
gets
propagated
to
every
other
section
.
Using
the
example
from
the
linked
website
","
let's
say
I
have
a
config
file
called
test1.ini
:
I
can
read
this
using
ConfigParser
:
But
I
notice
that
lh_server
is
the
same
in
both
sections
;
and
","
indeed
","
I
realise
that
it
will
be
the
same
for
most
hosts
I
might
add
.
So
I
can
do
this
","
as
test2.ini
:
Despite
the
sections
not
having
lh_server
keys
","
I
can
still
access
them
:
Read
the
linked
page
for
a
further
example
of
using
variable
substitution
in
the
DEFAULT
section
to
simplify
the
INI
file
even
more
.
