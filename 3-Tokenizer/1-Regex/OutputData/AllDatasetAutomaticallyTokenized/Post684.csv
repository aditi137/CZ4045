Are
you
looking
for
something
like
pyxsd
?
(
primarily
used
for
validation
against
a
schema
)
Or
maybe
PyXB
?
(
can
generate
classes
based
on
xml
)
Otherwise
","
I
don't
think
there's
a
tool
[yet]
that
will
generate
the
schema
from
within
Python
.
Can
you
do
it
on
demand
using
something
like
xsd.exe
?
Does
it
have
to
be
programmatic
/
repeatable
?
