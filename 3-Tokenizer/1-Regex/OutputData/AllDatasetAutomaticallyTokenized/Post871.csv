I
was
curious
about
this
too
and
it
seems
that
the
main
advantage
of
django-nose
using
the
python
nose
library
is
""""
Test
Discovery
""""
.
In
addition
","
from
http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/testing.html
you
can
also
write
simple
test
functions
","
as
well
as
test
classes
that
are
not
subclasses
of
unittest.TestCase
.
nose
also
supplies
a
number
of
helpful
functions
for
writing
timed
tests
","
testing
for
exceptions
","
and
other
common
use
cases
.
See
Writing
tests
and
Testing
tools
for
more
.
From
what
I
understand
from
other
python
developers
on
freenode
irc
","
Trial
test
runner
on
Twisted
Framework
have
these
similar
features
like
nose
.
I
am
still
not
entirely
convinced
about
using
django-nose
for
django
development
but
am
giving
a
shot
and
report
back
if
I
find
out
more
!
