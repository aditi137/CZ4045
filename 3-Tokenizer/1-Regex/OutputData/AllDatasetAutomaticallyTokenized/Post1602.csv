I
believe
you
want
to
print
each
character
of
the
input
string
twice
","
in
order
.
The
issue
with
your
attempt
is
your
use
of
return
.
You
only
want
to
return
the
final
string
","
not
just
a
single
repetition
of
one
character
from
inside
the
loop
.
So
you
want
your
return
statement
to
be
somehow
outside
the
for-loop
.
Since
this
sounds
like
a
homework
problem
","
try
to
figure
out
how
to
do
that
above
before
continuing
below
.
Still
stuck
?
Print
each
character
in
a
string
twice
","
in
order
:
Without
using
a
for-loop
:
