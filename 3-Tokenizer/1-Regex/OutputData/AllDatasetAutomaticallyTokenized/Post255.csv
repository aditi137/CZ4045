an
article
several
years
ago
about
why
Python
programmers
made
better
Java
programmers
.
(

)
Basically
","
regardless
of
whether
the
new
language
is
relevant
to
the
company's
current
methodology
","
learning
a
new
language
means
learning
new
ideas
.
Someone
who
is
willing
to
learn
a
language
that
isn't
considered
""""
business
class
""""
means
that
he
is
interested
in
programming
","
beyond
just
earning
a
paycheck
.
To
quote
Paul's
site
:
And
people
don't
learn
Python
because
it
will
get
them
a
job
;
they
learn
it
because
they
genuinely
like
to
program
and
aren't
satisfied
with
the
languages
they
already
know
.
Which
makes
them
exactly
the
kind
of
programmers
companies
should
want
to
hire
.
Hence
what
","
for
lack
of
a
better
name
","
I'll
call
the
Python
paradox
:
if
a
company
chooses
to
write
its
software
in
a
comparatively
esoteric
language
","
they'll
be
able
to
hire
better
programmers
","
because
they'll
attract
only
those
who
cared
enough
to
learn
it
.
And
for
programmers
the
paradox
is
even
more
pronounced
:
the
language
to
learn
","
if
you
want
to
get
a
good
job
","
is
a
language
that
people
don't
learn
merely
to
get
a
job
.
If
an
employer
was
willing
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
learning
a
new
language
","
chances
are
the
people
who
volunteered
to
learn
(
assuming
it
wasn't
a
mandatory
class
)
would
be
the
same
people
to
are
already
on
the
""""
fast
track
""""
.
