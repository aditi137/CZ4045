You
can't
directly
call
a
function
in
a
script
with
arguments
to
the
script
","
you
have
to
handle
the
command
line
arguments
yourself
and
then
call
the
function
:
Of
course
you
might
want
to
extend
this
in
several
ways
:
to
only
process
the
first
argument
(
this
example
processes
all
of
them
)
","
to
lowercase
the
argument
so
that
HELLO
and
BYE
also
work
","
or
maybe
to
display
some
help
if
no
arguments
are
given
.
As
@bufh
mentioned
","
if
your
command
line
arguments
are
going
to
get
much
more
complicated
than
this
then
you
might
want
to
look
into
a
library
that
handles
it
for
you
","
such
as
argparse
.
