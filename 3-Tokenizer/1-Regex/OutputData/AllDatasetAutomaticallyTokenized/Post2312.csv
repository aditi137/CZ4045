I've
noticed
weird
behavior
with
zmq.PUB
","
it
requires
to
have
while
loop
to
send
message
.
Example
:
Imagine
I
have
a
sub
waiting
for
a
pub
:
And
I
want
to
send
a
message
from
pub
:
This
message
won't
reach
the
sub
for
some
reason
.
You
can
fix
this
by
adding
while
or
for
loop
before
sending
a
message
publisher.send(''.join(sys.argv[1])
)
Why
is
that
?
Do
I
always
have
to
have
a
loop
with
publisher
to
distribute
messages
to
multiple
workers
?
