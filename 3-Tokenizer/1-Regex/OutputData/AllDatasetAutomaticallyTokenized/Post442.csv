I
encounter
such
an
problem
:
need
to
quote
the
space
only
.
fullurl
=
"quote(fullurl, safe=""%/:=&?~#+!$,;'@()"
*
[]
""""
)
do
help
","
but
it's
too
complicated
.
So
I
used
a
simple
way
:
url
=
"url.replace(' ', '%20')"
","
it's
not
perfect
","
but
it's
the
simplest
way
and
it
works
for
this
situation
.
