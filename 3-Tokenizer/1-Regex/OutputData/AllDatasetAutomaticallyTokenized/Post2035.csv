If
your
question
is
about
those
errors
at
the
top
","
those
are
server-side
error
responses
.
The
first
says
that
the
coordinator
you
contacted
cannot
satisfy
the
request
at
CL.ONE
","
with
the
nodes
it
believes
are
alive
.
This
can
happen
if
all
replicas
are
down
(
more
likely
with
a
low
replication
factor
)
.
The
other
two
errors
are
timeouts
","
where
the
coordinator
didn't
get
responses
from
'
live
'
nodes
in
a
time
configured
in
the
cassandra.yaml
.
All
of
these
indicate
that
the
cluster
you're
connected
to
is
not
healthy
.
This
could
be
because
it
is
overwhelmed
(
high
GC
pauses
)
","
or
experiencing
network
issues
.
Check
the
server
logs
for
clues
.
