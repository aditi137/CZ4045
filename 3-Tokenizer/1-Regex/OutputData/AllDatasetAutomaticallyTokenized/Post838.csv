The
API
for
shutil.ignore_patterns()
doesn't
support
absolute
paths
","
but
it
is
trivially
easy
to
roll
your
own
variant
.
As
a
starting
point
","
look
at
the
source
code
for
*
ignore_patterns
*
:
You
can
see
that
it
returns
a
function
that
accepts
a
path
and
list
of
names
","
and
it
returns
a
set
of
names
to
ignore
.
To
support
your
use
case
","
create
you
own
similar
function
that
uses
takes
advantage
of
path
argument
.
Pass
your
function
to
the
ignore
parameter
in
the
call
to
copytree()
.
Alternatively
","
don't
use
shutil
as-is
.
The
source
code
is
short
and
sweet
","
so
it
isn't
hard
to
cut
","
paste
","
and
customize
.
