By

separate

""""
do
you
mean
separate
applications
with
a
common
settings
?
That
is
to
say
","
two
applications
within
the
same
Django
site
(
or
project
)
?
If
so
","
the
{
%
url
%
}
tag
will
generate
a
proper
absolute
URL
to
any
of
the
apps
listed
in
the
settings
file
.
If
there
are
separate
Django
servers
with
separate
settings
","
you
have
the
standard
internet
problem
of
URI
design
.
Your
URI's
can
be
consistent
with
only
the
hostname
changing
.
You
never
need
to
provide
the
host
information
","
so
all
of
your
links
are
<
A
HREF
=
""""
/
some

path

""""
>
.
This
","
generally
","
works
out
the
best
.
You
have
can
someone's
random
laptop
being
a
test
server
;
you
can
get
the
IP
address
using
ifconfig
.
