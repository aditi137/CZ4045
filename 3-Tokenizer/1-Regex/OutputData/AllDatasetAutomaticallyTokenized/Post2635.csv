Not
sure
if
my
problem
sound
a
bit
tricky..my
requirement
is
like
this
:
I
have
three
columns
of
data
in
txt
file
as
below
:
col1
can
be
viewed
as
dict
keys
which
repeat
for
<
=
5
times
","
col3
can
also
viewed
as
nested
dict
keys
with
values
in
col2
","
i.e.
each
key
in
col1
has
<
=
5
pairs
of
(
col2
:
col3
)
.
I
would
like
to
sort
the
nested
dictionary
by
col2
and
replace
the
col2
values
with
highest
ranking
","
i.e.
:
I
don't
care
about
the
values
in
col2
","
i
only
care
about
the
ranking
of
col3
for
each
col1
value
:
I
tried
turning
the
data
into
nested
dictionaries
like
:
I
have
searched
around
and
found
some
solutions
like
sort
nested
dict
etc.
","
but
I
cannot
replace
the
values
with
rankings
either...can
someone
please
help
?
