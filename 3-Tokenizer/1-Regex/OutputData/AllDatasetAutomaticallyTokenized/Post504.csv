There
are
two
types
of
site-packages
directories
","
global
and
per
user
.
Global
site-packages
(
""""
dist-packages
""""
)
directories
are
listed
in
sys.path
when
you
run
:
For
a
more
concise
list
run
getsitepackages
from
the
site
module
in
Python
code
:
Note
:
With
virtualenvs
getsitepackages
is
not
available
","
sys.path
from
above
will
list
the
virtualenv's
site-packages
directory
correctly
","
though
.
The
per
user
site-packages
directory
(
PEP
370
)
is
where
Python
installs
your
local
packages
:
If
this
points
to
a
non-existing
directory
check
the
exit
status
of
Python
and
see
python

m
site

for
