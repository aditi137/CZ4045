recently
I
have
been
trying
to
make
a
spin-off
of
Collatz
conjecture
using
python
3.0
.
The
program
works
as
it
should
with
positive
integers
","
but
it
will
not
work
with
negative
integers
.
In
the
program
I
check
if
the
number
is
negative
and
if
so
I
square
it
","
and
then
proceed
with
collatz
","
rules
.
Unfortuanitly
it
gives
off
no
error
messages
.
Code
below
:
feel
free
to
try
out
my
code
","
it
only
uses
python
3
and
sys
!
-
thanks
