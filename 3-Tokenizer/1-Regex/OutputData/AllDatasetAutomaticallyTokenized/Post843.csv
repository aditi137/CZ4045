When
running
the
following
code
(
in
Python
2.7.1
on
a
mac
with
Mac
OS
X
10.7
)
I
get
the
following
error
I've
carefully
checked
for
errant
tabs
and
/
or
spaces
.
I
can
confirm
that
the
code
fails
with
the
above
error
when
I
use
the
recommended
4
spaces
of
indentation
.
This
behavior
also
happens
when
the
return
is
placed
inside
of
other
control
statements
(
e.g
.
if
","
for
","
etc.
)
.
Any
help
would
be
appreciated
.
Thanks
!
