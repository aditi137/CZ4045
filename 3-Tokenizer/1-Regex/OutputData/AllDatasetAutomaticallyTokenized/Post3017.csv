If
these
processes
are
independent
then
something
like
this
is
not
possible
.
At
least
not
without
some
additional
mechanisms
like
sockets
(
which
greatly
increases
complexity
)
.
If
these
are
created
via
multiprocessing
and
my_list
is
just
a
list
then
each
process
will
have
its
own
copy
of
the
list
.
Again
in
multiprocessing
if
you
define
my_list
as
multiprocessing.Queue
then
indeed
this
will
be
a
shared
structure
between
processes
.
