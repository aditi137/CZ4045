Hi
I
want
to
generalize
the
strategy
from
1
to
10
possible
investments
using
an
array
(
""""
instruments
""""
)
to
simplify
the
tasks
of
loading
the
10
feeds
","
creating
the
10
SMAs
and
then
","
each
day
","
checking
if
a
signal
crossing
happened
in
one
(
or
more
)
of
the
instruments
.
I
am
stuck
in
this
.
Also
plotter
is
plotting
graphs
separately
but
i
want
plot
all
intruments
result
in
one
graph
.
This
is
my
code
:
