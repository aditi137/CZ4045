As
Matthias
says
in
the
comment
","
it
doesn't
look
as
if
you're
actually
invoking
Django
at
all
-
those
are
normal
Apache
directory
indexes
(
so
naturally
Django
won't
be
parsing
the
templates
","
since
it's
not
even
being
called
)
.
Since
you're
just
starting
out
","
you
should
not
be
using
Apache
at
all
","
but
start
up
the
local
development
server
(
.
/
manage.py
runserver
)
as
explained
in
the
tutorial
.
