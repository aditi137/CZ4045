As
explained
in
the
PDF
specification
:
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html
There
is
a
""""
/
Lang
""""
key
in
the
Document
Catalog
.
In
my
version
of
the
PDF
specification
this
is
explained
in
section
7.7.2
.
This
language
key
defines
the
language
assumed
for
the
complete
document
","
with
the
exception
of
those
parts
that
are
marked
differently
.
So
","
two
caveats
:
1
)
This
""""
/
Lang
""""
key
is
optional
.
If
it's
not
there
the
PDF
specification
says
the
language
is
undefined
.
2
)
This
""""
/
Lang
""""
key
may
be
overwritten
by
other
elements
in
the
file
.
So
the
entire
document
may
be
English
","
but
specific
sentences
on
page
101
may
redefine
the
language
as
French
for
example
.
In
your
case
","
your
algorithm
should
first
try
to
find
the
overall
document
language
as
defined
above
.
If
that's
not
there
it's
up
to
you
what
to
do
.
You
could
search
the
complete
document
for
""""
/
Lang
""""
keys
to
see
if
you
find
any
other
","
but
if
you
find
multiple
","
you'll
have
to
decide
what
that
means
...
