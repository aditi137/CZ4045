Thank
you
for
all
your
answers
","
they
have
been
really
helpful
!
I
decided
to
use
the
IF
loop
instead
of
the
FOR
loop
","
like
this
:
As
much
as
I
can
see
","
this
solution
works
no
matter
what
the
length
of
the
list
is
","
and
it
seems
like
it
fits
the
definition
of
the
problem
i.e.
""""
no
matter
what
the
length
of
the
list
is
","
if
any
of
the
first
four
elements
equals
9
","
return
True
""""
.
