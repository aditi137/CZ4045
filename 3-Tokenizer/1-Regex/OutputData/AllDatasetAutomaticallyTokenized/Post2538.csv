I
am
trying
to
get
the
user
input
and
based
off
of
user
input
","
it
runs
the
gameloop
function
.
However
","
when
the
user
presses
the
right
key
","
it
does
not
run
the
function
or
at
least
I
do
not
think
so
.
No
errors
are
thrown
.
I
am
confused
on
why
it
will
not
work
right
now
.
I
am
running
python
3.4.3
.
Also
","
I
noticed
that
before
the
user
input
","
I
can't
move
the
pygame
window
until
after
the
user
input
.
That
tells
me
the
function
is
working
though
.
However
","
when
I
change
the
background
of
the
gameloop
function
to
blue
","
it
does
nothing
either
.
So
that
tells
me
it
is
not
working
.
I
have
no
idea
what
is
going
on
.
Here
is
my
code
.
Thanks
in
advance
.
