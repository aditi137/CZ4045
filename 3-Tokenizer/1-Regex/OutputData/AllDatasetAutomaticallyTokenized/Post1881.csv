Counter.update(iterable)
takes
an
iterable
(
hint
:
a
Python
string
IS
an
iterable
)
and
updates
the
count
for
each
item
of
the
iterable
-
so
what
you
get
is
really
what
is
to
be
expected
.
If
you
really
want
to
use
Counter.update()
here
","
you
have
to
pass
either
a
dict
with
'
1:2:3
'
as
key
and
1
as
value
or
a
sequence
of
(
key
","
value
)
tuples
(
ie
[
(
""""
1:2:3
""""
","
1
)
","
]
)
.
Else
you
can
of
course
use
the
ordinary
dict
syntax
as
mentioned
by
Daniel
Roseman
-
which
really
is
the
thing
to
do
if
you
have
no
other
reason
to
use
update()
.
