This
may
have
been
covered
by
something
else
but
I've
been
unable
to
find
something
that
matches
up
to
my
scenario...I'm
pretty
new
to
selenium
webdriver
and
Python
so
please
excuse
any
'
best
practice
'
issues
in
my
code
.
I'm
trying
to
find
a
solution
that
counts
the
instance
of
field
errors
on
a
web
form
and
if
it
is
greater
than
or
equal
to
1
then
the
result
should
be
a
fail
.
If
zero
then
a
pass
.
In
addition
I
would
like
to
print
to
the
console
which
field
errors
being
presented
.
I'm
using
xpaths
stored
in
a
dictionary
for
maintainability
and
then
returning
the
string
from
the
label
(
which
is
also
my
xpath
identifier
)
.
In
addition
the
error
messages
are
only
presented
on
the
fly
so
need
to
handle
the
exception
'
NoSuchElementException
'
I
know
what
I
want
to
achieve
but
can't
seem
to
get
the
syntax
right
so
every
time
the
result
is
'
Pass
'
-
I
believe
this
is
because
1
or
more
of
my
xpaths
are
returning
the
exception
.
Below
is
a
snippet
of
the
code
block
I
want
to
do
the
count
and
return
the
result
:
Here
is
a
snippet
of
my
dictionary
:
In
addition
the
'
for
key
in
formErrors
'
sits
inside
a
for
loop
that
sends
inputs
from
a
csv
into
the
fields...and
submits
the
form
for
each
time
the
csv
has
a
value...I
don't
think
this
is
needed
to
answer
my
question
but
thought
best
to
provide
for
insight
.
