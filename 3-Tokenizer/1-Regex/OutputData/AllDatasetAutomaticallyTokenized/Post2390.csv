So
","
I
have
a
directory
structure
:
In
main.py
","
modules
are
dynamically
loaded
at
runtime
","
depending
on
which
modules
are
specified
.
(
This
allows
for
a
hypothetical
c.py
to
be
added
","
main.py
to
be
rerun
","
and
the
program
to
detect
the
addition
of
c.py
and
run
it
.
)
The
problem
is
that
b.py
imports
a
module
installed
via
pip
(
in
a
virtualenv
)
.
(
I'm
going
to
refer
to
it
as
a
library
to
help
avoid
confusion
.
)
When
b.py
is
run
directly
(
python
b.py
)
the
library
imports
just
fine
.
When
the
shell
is
opened
and
the
library
is
imported
by
hand
","
it
works
.
But
","
when
main.py
is
run
and
b.py
is
dynamically
imported
(
using
pkgutil.iter_modules
to
detect
the
modules
and
then
importlib.import_module
to
import the
required
ones
)
","
the
library
that
b.py
imports
isn't
found
-
an
ImportError
:
No
module
is
thrown
.
To
recap
:
a
module
imports
an
installed
library
","
and
this
works
when
the
module
is
run
directly
or
when
the
library
in
question
is
imported
manually
in
the
python
interpreter
","
but
when
the
module
is
dynamically
imported
","
the
library
isn't
found
.
What
gives
?
