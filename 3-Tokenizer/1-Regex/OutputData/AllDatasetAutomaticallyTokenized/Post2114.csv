I
have
an
array
of
bytes
in
python
","
which
looks
like
this
:
I
have
to
remove
each
nth
byte
(
A
","
B
","
C
in
the
example
)
.
Array
length
can
be
many
thousands
.
Typical
chunk
size
can
be
128
or
few
thounds
.
This
is
my
current
solution
:
I
am
looking
for
other
solutions
","
which
could
be
more
elegant
.
Python
3.x
only
solutions
are
fine
.
