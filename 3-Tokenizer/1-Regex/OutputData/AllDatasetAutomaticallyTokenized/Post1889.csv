I
wanted
to
ask
if
it's
possible
to
create
PDF
/
XLS
documents
as
temporary
files
.
I'm
doing
that
to
send
them
using
flask
afterwards
.
For
pdf
/
xls
files
creation
I
use
reportlab
and
xlsxwriter
packages
respectively
.
When
I
save
document
using
their
methods
","
I
get
the
""""
Python
temporary
file
permission
denied
""""
error
.
When
I
try
to
close
using
the
tempfile
methods
","
files
become
corrupted
.
Is
there
any
way
to
overcome
this
?
Or
any
other
suitable
solution
?
EDIT
:
Some
code
snippets
:
Similar
story
with
pdf
files
.
