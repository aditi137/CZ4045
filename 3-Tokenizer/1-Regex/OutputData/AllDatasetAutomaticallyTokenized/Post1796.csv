I
have
","
what
I
believe
","
to
be
some
complex
processing
of
my
model
data
that
would
be
easier
to
take
care
of
inside
my
view
than
inside
of
an
html
template
.
Thus
","
I
would
be
returning
the
raw
html
inside
of
HttpResponse
.
However
","
I
would
still
like
to
get
the
benefit
of
template
inheritance
that
render_to_response
provides
.
Thus
","
I
would
like
to
do
something
like
the
following
:
I
don't
require
the
use
of
any
other
template
tags
or
variable
evaluation
.
Is
this
possible
in
Django
?
How
do
I
best
go
about
doing
this
?
