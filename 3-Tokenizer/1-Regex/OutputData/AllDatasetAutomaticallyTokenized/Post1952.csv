To
be
able
to
run
a
Python
script
in
Powershell
you
can
press
F5
to
open
the
run

up
Powershell

an
ugly
format
similar

what
cmd
looks

by
default

features

it
also
does
not
run
the
script
from
the
directory
so
relative
paths
don't
work
.
To
make
the
Powershell
look
normal
you
should
run
it

the
shortcut
that
is

the
start
menu

to
allow
it
to
work
if
the
file
path
has
a
space
in
it
you
should
put
a
\
before
the
quotation
marks
.
The
working
run
command
is
therefore
;
