I've
just
looked
at
this
frames
one
more
time
and
I've
realized
that
the
first
byte
:
which
according
to
the
specification
means
that
RSV1
is
used
(
the
second
bit
is
1
)
.
This
seems
to
mean
that
the
extension
is
used
and
indeed
in
my
handshake
code
I've
found
the
following
line
:
and
in
Chrome
I
can
see
:
when
I
do
the
handshake
.
I'm
not
sure
yet
how
these
extensions
work
but
removing
these
3
lines
from
the
handshake
code
fixes
the
issue
.
