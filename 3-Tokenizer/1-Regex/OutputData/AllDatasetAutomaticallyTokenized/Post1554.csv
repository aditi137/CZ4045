When
I
run
a
python
script
that
uses
multiprocessing
I
find
it
hard
to
get
it
to
stop
cleanly
when
it
receives
Ctrl-C
.
Ctrl-C
has
to
be
pressed
multiple
times
and
all
sorts
of
error
messages
appear
on
the
screen
.
How
can
you
make
a
python
script
that
uses
multiprocessing
and
quits
cleanly
when
it
receives
a
Ctrl-C
?
Take
this
script
for
example
