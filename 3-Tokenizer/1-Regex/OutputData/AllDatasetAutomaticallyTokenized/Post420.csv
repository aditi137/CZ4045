Suppose
we
have
an
iterator
(
an
infinite
one
)
that
returns
lists
(
or
finite
iterators
)
","
for
example
one
returned
by
What
is
a
good
Python
idiom
to
get
an
iterator
(
obviously
infinite
)
that
will
return
each
of
the
elements
from
the
first
iterator
","
then
each
from
the
second
one
","
etc.
In
the
example
above
it
would
return
1
","
2
","
3
","
1
","
2
","
3
","
....
The
iterator
is
infinite
","
so
itertools.chain(*infinite)
will
not
work
.
