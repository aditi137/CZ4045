The
user
story
:
An
user
clicks
somewhere
","
and
we
are
recording
his
action
.
Can
we
","
somehow
","
get
access
to
the
original
request
object
so
we
will
be
able
to
extract
some
required
information
from
it
?
The
catch
:
We
cannot
change
the
StudentActionModel
code
","
we're
writing
a
plugin
to
the
original
Django
application
and
can't
change
any
of
the
original
code
.
We
are
just
defining
a
listener
for
the
'
post_save
'
signal
and
we
need
a
piece
of
data
from
the
original
request
object
.
