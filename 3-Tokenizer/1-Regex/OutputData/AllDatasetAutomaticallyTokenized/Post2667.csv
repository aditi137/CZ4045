I
guess
you
could
do
something
like
:
Where
using
:
reversed
-
because
bits
are
read
from
LSB
to
MSB
so
we
need
to
iterate
from
right
to
left
.
enumerate
-
because
we
want
to
get
the
associated
index
to
check
in
our
mapping
what
is
the
feature
name
/
attributes
.
""""
""""
.
join(bits)
-
because
we
want
to
be
able
to
join
all
the
items
on
the
list
to
one
iterable
object
we
can
go
through
.
