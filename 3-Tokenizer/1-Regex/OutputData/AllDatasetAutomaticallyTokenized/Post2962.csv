The
reason
why
it's
only
the
last
file
that
could
be
copied
(
if
it
was
)
is
because
in
this
line
:
you
are
referencing
rowDict
outside
of
the
first
for-loop
.
So
at
that
execution
moment
","
it
contains
the
last
value
of
this
loop
.
If
I
understand
correctly
what
you
are
trying
to
do
you
could
try
something
like
this
(
untested
code
)
:
So
instead
of
:
Constructing
a
dictionary
with
all
the
values
in
your
CSV
file
Somehow
check
for
every
file
in
your
source
directory
that
it
is
included
in
your
dictionary
(
which
is
what
I
interpreted
you
were
trying
to
do
)
And
move
it
if
it
does
.
You
could
:
For
every
file
extracted
from
your
CSV
","
check
that
it
exists
in
your
source
directory
.
If
it
does
","
you
move
it
to
the
destination
directory
.
Is
that
what
you
were
trying
to
doÂ
?
[
And
if
the
filename
stays
the
same
","
you
only
need
to
specify
the
destination
directory
for
the
second
argument
of
shutil.move()
]
