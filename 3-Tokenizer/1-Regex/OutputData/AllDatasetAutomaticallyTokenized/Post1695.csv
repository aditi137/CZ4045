According
to
the
source
code
","
Scrapy
uses
the
following
CSS
selector
to
parse
the
inputs
out
of
the
form
:
In
other
words
","
all
of
your
hidden
inputs
are
successfully
parsed
(
and
sent
with
the
request
later
)
with
the
values
equal
to
value
attributes
.
So
","
Scrapy
does
what
it
should
here
.
The
login
using
from_response()
doesn't
work
because
__EVENTTARGET
has
a
empty
value
attribute
.
If
you
make
the
login
using
a
real
browser
","
__EVENTTARGET
parameter
value
would
be
set
to
b_Login
via
javascript
__doPostBack()
function
call
.
And
","
since
Scrapy
cannot
handle
javascript
(
cannot
call
js
functions
)
","
__EVENTTARGET
is
sent
with
an
empty
value
which
causes
login
failure
.
__EVENTARGUMENT
has
an
empty
value
too
","
but
it
is
actually
set
to
the
empty
string
in
the
__doPostBack()
function
","
so
it
doesn't
make
a
difference
here
.
Hope
that
helps
.
