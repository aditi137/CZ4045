I'm
trying
to
create
a
ticket
in
osticket
through
its
REST
API
(
https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket-1.7/blob/develop/setup/doc/api/tickets.md
)
The
problem
is
/
api
/
tickets.json
returns
404
.
I
have
it
installed
in
a
server
on
osticket
folder
(
something
like
http://my.net.work.ip/osticket/api/tickets.json
-
404
)
Also
","
I've
tried
to
CURL
the
server
(
logged
in
through
ssh
)
","
created
an
APIKey
for
the
server's
IP
address
and
had
the
same
response
.
What
am
I
missing
here
?
Thank
you
