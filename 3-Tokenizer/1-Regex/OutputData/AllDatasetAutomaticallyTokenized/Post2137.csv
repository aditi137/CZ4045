Inside
the
for
loop
for
for
word
in
words
:
when
you
do
-
lst.append(words)
-
it
appends
the
whole
words
list
into
lst
","
I
believe
you
intended
to
use
-
lst.append(word)
.
Also
","
the
for
loop
-
for
word
in
words
:
should
be
indented
inside
for
line
in
openedfile
:
","
so
that
you
run
the
loop
for
each
line
.
And
lastly
","
if
you
want
to
lexicographically
sort
the
words
","
you
should
call
-
lst.sort()
at
the
end
.
Also
","
it
would
be
better
to
use
with
statement
to
open
the
file
","
so
that
it
can
handle
closing
the
file
after
everything
is
finish
automatically
.
Also
","
it
may
be
easier
to
use
set()
as
the
initial
data
type
to
store
the
elements
as
the
not
in
operator
for
list
is
O(n)
","
and
as
the
list
gets
bigger
","
that
would
take
more
time
.
Whereas
with
a
set
data
type
","
you
do
not
need
to
worry
about
checking
if
the
set
already
has
the
word
","
since
set
does
not
allow
duplicates
.
At
the
end
","
you
can
use
list(..)
to
convert
the
set
back
to
list
and
then
sort
it
.
