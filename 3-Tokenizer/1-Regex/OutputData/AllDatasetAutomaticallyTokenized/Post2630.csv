I
would
approach
this
as
a
Text
Classification
problem
","
because
using
blacklists
of
words
typically
does
not
work
very
well
to
classify
full
texts
.
The
main
reason
why
blacklists
don't
work
is
that
you
will
have
a
lot
of
false
positives
(
one
example
:
your
list
contains
the
word
'
sexy
'
","
which
alone
isn't
enough
to
flag
a
document
as
being
for
adults
)
.
To
do
so
you
need
a
training
set
with
documents
tagged
as
being
""""
adult
content
""""
and
others
""""
safe
for
work
""""
.
So
here
is
what
I
would
do
:
check
whether
an
existing
labelled
dataset
can
be
used
.
You
need
several
thousands
of
documents
of
each
class
.
If
you
don't
find
any
","
create
one
.
For
instance
you
can
create
a
scraper
and
download
Reddit
content
.
Read
for
instance
