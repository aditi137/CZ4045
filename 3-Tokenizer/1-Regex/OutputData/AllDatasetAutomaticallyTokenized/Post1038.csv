I'm
trying
to
write
a
function
in
python(2.7)
.
This
function
will
take
a
list
of
8
values
which
represents
the
coordinates
of
vertices
.
(
Form
of
the
input
is
"[Ax,Ay,Bx,By,Cx,Cy,Dx,Dy]"
)
The
function
will
determine
whether
these
vertices
are
given
in
order
to
form
a
valid
rectangle
.
If
not
","
it
will
put
them
in
order
and
return
a
sorted
list
of
these
vertices
.
The
starting
point
or
the
direction(whether it is clockwise or anti-clockwise)
is
not
important
.
Let
me
illusrate
what
I
want
:
If
the
given
input
forms
the
2nd
or
3rd
shape
in
the
link
below
;
the
function
will
convert
it
to
the
first
one
.

Which
algorithm
can
I
use
to
do
this
?
I
have
used
the
way
Alexey
suggested
and
wrote
my
code
.
It
can
take
some
optimizations
but
it
is
not
neccessary
for
me
atm
.
