I
am
developing
a
small
independent
python
application
which
uses
Celery
.
I
have
built
this
using
django
framework
but
my
application
is
back
end
only
.
This
means
that
the
users
do
not
need
to
visit
my
site
and
my
application
is
built
only
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
tasks
queue
from
celery
and
performing
operations
on
the
database
.
In
order
to
perform
operations
on
the
database
","
I
need
to
use
Django
modules
.
What
I
am
trying
to
do
is
eliminate
the
rest
of
my
django
application
and
use
ONLY
celery
and
django
models
modules
(
including
the
dependencies
required
to
run
these
)
.
In
short
","
my
simple
celery
application
will
be
running
receiving
instructions
from
my
redis
broker
and
perform
operations
in
database
using
django
models
.
Is
is
possible
to
do
this
?
If
so
","
how
?
Here
is
my
project
structure
:
Here
is
my
settings.py
