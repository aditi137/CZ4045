I'm
using
the
python
compiler
in
java
and
I
tried
import os
.
My
problem
is
when
I
couldn't
input
it
to
continue
the
next
line
while
it
just
sent
back
this
message
os
is
not
yet
implemented
in
skulpt
on
line
1
.
I
already
tried
with
another
app
and
still
get
a
same
result
.
I
tried
to
search
Google
but
no
result
.
I
read
in
learning
web
and
it's
never
seem
the
existence
of
this
error
.
What
is
skulpt

Please
