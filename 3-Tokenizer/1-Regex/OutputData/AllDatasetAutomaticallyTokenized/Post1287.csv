In
2.x
","
use
raw_input()
instead
of
input()
-
this
is
because
in
Python
2.x
","
input()
parses
the
user's
input
as
Python
code
","
which
is
dangerous
and
slow
.
raw_input()
just
gives
you
the
string
.
In
3.x
","
they
changed
input()
to
work
that
way
as
it
is
what
you
generally
want
.
This
is
a
simple
list
comprehension
that
takes
the
split
components
of
the
input
(
using
str.split()
","
which
splits
on
whitespace
)
and
makes
each
component
an
integer
.
