I've
been
having
some
trouble
with
the
memcache
viewer
after
updating
the
Python
Dev
Appserver
to
Google
App
Engine
1.7.6
(
with
Python
2.7
)
.
It
appears
that
my
memcache
isn't
updated
or
isn't
readable
.
I
have
tried
to
view
memcache
with
the
app
engine
memcache
viewer
but
when
I
input
the
memcache
key
I
get
an
error
.
when
I
flush
the
cache
everything
proceeds
as
normal
until
memcache
needs
to
be
read
again
...
The
hit
ratio
and
memcache
size
increases
as
normal
","
so
there
is
something
in
the
cache
.
Also
when
I
revert
back
to
app
engine
1.7.5
everything
works
just
fine
.
Perhaps
someone
else
has
had
this
issue
?
When
I
input
the
memcache
key
I
get
the
following
:
I
tried
including
an
""""
import pickle
""""
in
my
main.py
but
this
was
in
vain
.
I've
included
some
samples
of
my
code
but
hopefully
this
isn't
necessary
I
hope
its
something
more
to
do
with
the
app
engine
update
than
my
code
...
some
of
my
main.py
file
:
and
a
sample
function
for
how
I
handle
memcache
:
and
if
I
want
to
query
the
users
in
my
db
I
use
:
UPDATE
:
I
added
""""
import pickle
""""
to
the
memcache_viewer.py
file
in
Google\google_appengine\google\appengine\tools\devappserver2\admin\memcache_viewer.py
(
is
this
a
bug
?
?
)
and
now
when
I
type
in
a
memcache
key
I
get
the
following
error
under
the
memcache
key
input
field
:
Error
fetching
USERS
:
Failed
to
retrieve
value
from
cache
:
No
module
named
main
Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
","
thanks
in
advance
.
