Your
code
is
working
perfectly
well
for
me
:
Though
","
are
you
using
a
Unix
system
to
try
this
?
Whether
this
is
a
Linux
","
a
BSD
or
a
Mac
?
The
signal
module
may
not
be
present
at
all
on
other
OS
","
as
this
is
using
a
feature
very
specific
to
unix
systems
","
even
though
windows
does
have
a
very
basic
support
of
POSIX
processes
.
edit
:
Well
","
as
I'm
saying
you're
in
a
very
particular
case
","
which
is
neither
Unix
or
windows
or
even
symbian
;
but
you're
running
it
in
Jython
","
which
does
not
have
access
to
the
OS
features
","
whereas
the
lack
of
signal
module
.
You
should
have
tagged
your
question
with
Jython
","
to
help
us
help
you
more
efficiently
!
Then
you'd
better
use
a
thread
timer
which
should
be
well
implemented
in
Jython
.
As
a
very
basic
example
:
As
a
more
complex
example
","
where
I'm
using
a
simple
lock
semaphore
to
handle
the
signaling
between
the
main
thread
and
the
timer
thread
:
