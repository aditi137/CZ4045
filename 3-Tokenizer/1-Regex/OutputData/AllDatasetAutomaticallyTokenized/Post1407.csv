Trying
to
use
Python
mechanize
to
log
in
to
a
webpage
.
Since
I
have
a
problem
with
finding
the
correct
form
","
instead
of
posting
the
URL
(
which
the
code
might
change
)
I
will
copy
some
of
the
code
here
for
future
users
.
I
read
this
","
but
there
didn't
seem
too
be
a
definitive
answer
.
Anyways
","
I
did
everything
with
mechanize
in
this
tutorial
up
until
where
I
am
getting
the
forms
.
When
I
call
:
I
get
back
:
Looking
at
the
raw
HTML
I
see
:
However
","
when
I
try
to
select
the
email
field
I
get
a
form
not
found
error
.
I
have
also
tried
using
the
form
ID
","
and
many
other
possible
form
names
.
I
don't
understand
why
printing
the
forms
with
br.forms()
returns
those
strange
results
","
does
this
mean
the
site
is
using
javascript
for
login
forms
?
Thank
you
in
advance
!
