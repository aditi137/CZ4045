To
allow
the
user
to
interact
with
the
desktop
in
real-time
","
you
need
to
run
the
application
in
the
users
web
browser
.
Interaction
with
a
webserver
would
just
be
too
slow
to
do
anything
meaningful
.
I
do
not
know
about
any
way
to
execute
Python
in
a
web
browser
","
so
I
would
rule
it
out
.
Some
of
your
options
for
client-sided
code
execution
are
:
Javascript
(
the
recent
addition
of
Canvas
and
WebSocket
made
it
suitable
for
this
kind
of
problem
)
Java
Applets
(
felt
out
of
favor
recently
due
to
security
problems
)
ActiveX
(
IE
-
and
Windows
only
","
very
rarely
used
in
a
public
context
nowadays
)
Flash
(
a
popular
but
dying
technology
)
