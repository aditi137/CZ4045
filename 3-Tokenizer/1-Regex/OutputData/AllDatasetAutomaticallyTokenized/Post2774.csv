What
could
be
regex
which
match
anystring
followed
by
daily
but
it
must
not
match
daily
preceded
by
m
?
For
example
it
should
match
following
string
beta.daily
abcdaily
dailyabc
daily
But
it
must
not
match
mdaily
or
abcmdaily
or
mdailyabc
I
have
tried
following
and
other
regex
but
failed
each
time
:
r
'
[
^
m
]
daily
'
:
But
it
doesn't
match
with
daily
r
'
[
^
m
]
?
daily
'
:
It
match
with
string
containing
mdaily
which
is
not
intended
