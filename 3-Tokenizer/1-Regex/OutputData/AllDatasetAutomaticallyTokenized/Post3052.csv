Situation
I
want
to
train
a
specific
network
architecture
(
a
GAN
)
that
needs
inputs
from
different
sources
during
training
.
One
input
source
is
examples
loaded
from
disk
.
The
other
source
is
a
generator
sub-network
creating
examples
.
To
choose
which
kind
of
input
to
feed
to
the
network
I
use
tf.cond
.
There
is
one
caveat
though
that
has
already
been
explained
:
tf.cond
evaluates
the
inputs
to
both
conditional
branches
even
though
only
one
of
those
will
ultimately
be
used
.
Enough
setup
","
here
is
a
minimal
working
example
:
Problem
Variant
1
does
not
work
at
all
since
the
queue
runner
threads
don't
seem
to
run
.
print(threads)
outputs
something
like
[
<
"Thread(Thread-1, stopped daemon 140165838264064)"
>
","
...
]
.
Variant
2
does
work
and
print(threads)
outputs
something
like
[
<
"Thread(Thread-1, started daemon 140361854863104)"
>
","
...
]
.
But
since
load_input_data()
has
been
called
outside
of
tf.cond
","
batches
of
data
will
be
loaded
from
disk
even
when
load_inputs_pred
is
False
.
Is
it
possible
to
make
Variant
1
work
","
so
that
input
data
is
only
loaded
when
load_inputs_pred
is
True
and
not
for
every
call
to
session.run()
?
