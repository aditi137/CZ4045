I
used
some
code
taken
from
Rosetta
Code
.
I
renamed
a
few
things
but
I
didn't
really
change
anything
.
It
pretty
closely
matches
some
psuedocode
.
However
","
when
I
test
the
number
123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901
it
returns
False
.
Other
(
python
and
java
)
implementations
of
Miller-Rabin
return
True
for
probable
prime
.
After
some
testing
","
try_composite
returns
True
after
only
2
rounds
!
I
would
really
like
to
know
any
error
","
I'm
guessing
a
mis-indent
or
some
feature
I
don't
know
about
.
