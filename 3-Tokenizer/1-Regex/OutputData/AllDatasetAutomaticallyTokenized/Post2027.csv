I
want
a
list
of
URLs
that
will
download
artifacts
from
Artifactory
.
The
list
of
URLs
should
come
from
a
REST
query
.
I
am
successfully
calling
the
Artifactory
(
3.2.2
)
REST
API
for
various
data
I
need
.
In
one
case
","
I
am
doing
a
property
search
","
searching
for
artifacts
with
an
""""
application_name
""""
and
""""
release_version
""""
.
These
properties
were
added
by
TeamCity
when
the
artifacts
were
deployed
.
I
can
successfully
search
Artifactory
using
the
Artifactory
Property
Search
tool
in
the
web
console
","
and
I
can
successfully
search
with
those
same
terms
from
my
python
script
.
The
REST
call
returns
json
.
Within
that
json
is
an
array
of
dicts
","
and
each
of
those
is
a
{
uri
:
url
}
.
All
good
","
but
not
quite
.
The
URL
returns
a
404
when
pasted
into
a
web
browser
.
By
walking
thru
the
url
","
I
discover
that
the
/
api
/
storage
part
is
what's
throwing
off
the
browser
.
I
suspect
that's
because
this
URI
is
not
meant
for
browsers
","
but
for
another
REST
query
.
Sheesh
.
The
documentation
is
not
clear
on
this
.
It
sure
seems
like
I
should
be
able
to
get
a
proper
browser
URL
from
a
REST
call
.
Example
URL
:
""""
"http://ourserver.org:8081/artifactory/api/storage/our-releases/com/companyname/Training/1.7.4/Training.ipa"""
It's
easy
to
replace
""""
/
api
/
storage
""""
with
""""
/
simple
""""
in
that
URL
string
and
that
makes
the
URL
work
in
a
browser
.
I
just
think
it's
an
ugly
solution
.
I
mostly
think
I'm
missing
something
","
perhaps
obvious
.
Suggestions
welcome
!
