Recently
I'm
studying
parallel
programming
tools
in
Python
.
And
here
are
two
major
differences
between
os.pipe
and
multiprocessing.Pipe.(despite
the
occasion
they
are
used
)
os.pipe
is
unidirectional
","
multiprocessing.Pipe
is
bidirectional
;
When
putting
things
into
pipe
/
receive
things
from
pipe
","
os.pipe
uses
encode
/
decode
","
while
multiprocessing.Pipe
uses
pickle
/
unpickle
I
want
to
know
if
my
understanding
is
correct
","
and
is
there
other
difference
?
Thank
you
.
