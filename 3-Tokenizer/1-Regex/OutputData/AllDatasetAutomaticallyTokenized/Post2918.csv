Is
it
possible
to
deploy
multiple
platforms
to
AWS
?
I
have
a
PHP
application
that
I
would
also
like
to
run
a
small
python
script
.
I
see
the
PHP
platform
installs
Python
by
default
","
but
using
eb
deploy
AWS
does
not
pick
up
requirements.txt
and
install
the
dependencies
.
I
have
tried
installing
requirements.txt
manually
which
hangs
when
trying
to
install
lxml
.
I
also
tried
adding
a
config
file
:
But
now
eb
deploy
complains
about
:
Which
I
believe
is
because
eb
thinks
this
is
only
a
PHP
app
.
What
is
the
proper
way
to
run
multiple
platforms
side-by-side
?
