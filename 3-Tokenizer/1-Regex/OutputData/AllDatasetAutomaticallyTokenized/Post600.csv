Why
do
you
have
a
list
of
both
numbers
and
some
other
kind
of
object
?
It
seems
like
you're
trying
to
compensate
for
a
design
flaw
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
","
I
want
it
work
this
way
because
I
want
to
keep
data
that
is
already
encoded
in
JsonedData()
","
then
I
want
json
module
to
give
me
some
way
to
insert
a
'
raw
'
item
data
rather
than
the
defaults
","
so
that
encoded
JsonedData
could
be
reuseable
.
here's
the
code
","
thanks
