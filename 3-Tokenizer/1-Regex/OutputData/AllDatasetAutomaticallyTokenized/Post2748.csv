I've
been
struggling
with
django
registration
redux
over
the
past
two
weeks
.
.
I'm
using
the
templates
the
were
provided
in
the
documentation
but
I've
made
a
couple
of
changes
like
adding
crispy
forms
and
changing
the
button
and
some
other
stuff
but
the
problem
is
that
none
of
these
changes
are
being
shown
on
http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/register
or
any
other
link
.
I'm
using
djang
registration
redux
1.4
","
django
1.8
","
python
2.7.10
Any
help
appreciated
","
thanks
