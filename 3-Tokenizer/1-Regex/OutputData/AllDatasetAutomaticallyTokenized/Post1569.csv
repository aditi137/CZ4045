If
your
problems
allows
transitive
relations
","
i.e.
x
is
in
the
group
as
long
as
it's
at
most
7
away
from
any
element
in
the
group
","
then
this
seems
to
me
like
a
graph
theory
problem
.
To
be
more
specific
","
you
need
to
find
all
connected
components
.
The
problem
itself
is
pretty
easy
to
solve
with
a
recursive
algorithms
.
You
would
first
create
a
dictionary
in
which
every
key
would
be
one
of
the
elements
and
every
value
would
be
a
list
of
elements
which
are
at
most
7
apart
from
that
element
.
For
your
example
","
you
would
have
something
like
this
:
Which
would
give
you
something
like
this
Now
you
need
to
write
a
recursive
function
which
will
take
as
input
an
element
and
a
list
","
and
it
will
keep
adding
elements
in
a
list
as
long
as
it
can
find
an
element
which
is
at
most
7
apart
from
the
current
element
.
Somewhere
in
the
code
you
also
need
to
remember
which
elements
you
have
already
visited
to
make
sure
that
you
don't
get
into
an
infinite
loop
.
You
need
to
call
that
function
for
every
element
in
your
list
.
This
code
should
give
the
following
output
for
your
input
:
