That
is
because
deleting
an
object
does
not
automatically
delete
objects
that
it
references
.
Meaning
lets
say
we
have
-
When
we
do
del
l
","
it
deletes
the
name
l
","
not
the
object
it
references
.
Example
-
It
just
decreases
the
reference
for
the
object
by
1
","
when
the
references
for
an
object
reaches
0
it
can
get
garbage
collected
.
So
in
your
binary
search
tree
case
","
when
you
do
-
You
are
just
deleting
the
local
variable
/
name
min_right
","
not
the
object
it
references
.
