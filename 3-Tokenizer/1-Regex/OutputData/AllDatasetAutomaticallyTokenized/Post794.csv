I
had
a
similar
problem
with
Skype4Py
and
","
at
least
in
my
case
","
it
turned
out
that
Skype4Py
doesn't
work
with
64-bit
Python
on
the
Mac
.
Might
not
apply
to
you
though
since
your
script
works
sometimes
.
If
you're
using
a
Mac
","
see
the
Ned
Deily's
comment
in
this
question
for
how
to
run
32-bit
Python
:
How
do
I
force
Python
to
be
32-bit
on
Snow
Leopard
and
other
32-bit
/
64-bit
questions
And
just
a
few
hours
after
writing
the
above
","
I
faced
a
similar
intermittent
seg
fault
on
Linux
.
In
this
case
","
the
seg
fault
went
away
when
I
connected
using
X11
instead
of
DBUS
