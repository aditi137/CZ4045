In
python
is
it
possible
to
get
or
set
a
logical
directory
(
as
opposed
to
an
absolute
one
)
.
For
example
if
I
have
:
and
I
have
linked
to
the
same
directory
.
using
os.getcwd
and
os.chdir
will
always
use
the
absolute
path
The
only
way
I
have
found
to
get
around
this
at
all
is
to
launch
'
pwd
'
in
another
process
and
read
the
output
.
However
","
this
only
works
until
you
call
os.chdir
for
the
first
time
.
