so
i'm
making
alittle
project
as
i
am
a
beginner
and
i'm
doing
some
webscraping
.
I
wanted
to
print
the
lyrics
of
a
song
each
on
it's
line
using
beautifulsoup
in
python
but
instead
it's
printing
like
this
:
I
looked
out
this
morning
and
the
sun
was
goneTurned
on
some
music
to
start
my
dayI
lost
myself
in
a
familiar
songI
closed
my
eyes
and
I
slipped
awayIt's
more
than
a
feeling
(
more
than
a
feeling)When
I
hear
that
old
song
they
used
to
play
(
more
than
a
feeling)And
I
begin
dreaming
(
more
than
a
feeling)Till
I
see
Marianne
walk
awayI
see
my
Marianne
walkin
'
awaySo
many
people
have
come
and
goneTheir
faces
fade
as
the
years
go
byYet
I
still
recall
as
I
wander
onAs
clear
as
the
sun
in
the
summer
skyIt's
more
than
a
feeling
(
more
than
a
feeling)When
I
hear
that
old
song
they
used
to
play
(
more
than
a
feeling)And
I
begin
dreaming
(
more
than
a
feeling)Till
I
see
Marianne
walk
awayI
see
my
Marianne
walkin
'
awayWhen
I'm
tired
and
thinking
coldI
hide
in
my
music
","
forget
the
dayAnd
dream
of
a
girl
I
used
to
knowI
closed
my
eyes
and
she
slipped
awayShe
slipped
awayIt's
more
than
a
feeling
(
more
than
a
feeling)When
I
hear
that
old
song
they
used
to
play
(
more
than
a
feeling)And
I
begin
dreaming
(
more
than
a
feeling)Till
I
see
Marianne
walk
away
This
is
my
