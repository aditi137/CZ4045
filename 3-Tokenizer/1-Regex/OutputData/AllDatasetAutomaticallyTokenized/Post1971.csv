The
only
way
to
keep
the
original
reference
of
the
objects
if
you
have
things
like
A.side
which
is
an
int
is
to
either
keep
it
in
a
list
or
a
class
of
it's
own
.
For
example
","
you
can
do
this
:
Now
","
you
can
make
Square
","
Rectangle
and
Circle
such
that
they
use
the
class
Value
for
each
of
their
variables
.
and
then
use
it
in
dimensions
like
dimensions
=
[
A.side
","
...
]
Note
","
now
that
A.side
is
a
class
-
the
value
cannot
be
seen
using
print(A.side)
but
can
be
seen
using
print(A.side.value)
