I
am
trying
to
get
urllib2
to
work
with
PyWebKitGtk
to
support
cookies
.
I
think
it's
mostly
working
","
but
cookies
aren't
working
between
sessions
.
The
cookies.txt
file
is
saved
","
and
it
does
look
like
it
uses
the
cookies
in
the
requests
(
examined
in
Wireshark
)
","
but
the
data
I
am
seeing
loaded
into
the
browser
window
doesn't
appear
to
have
been
using
the
cookies
.
After
I
log
in
","
shut
down
the
app
","
then
restart
it
","
my
login
session
is
gone
.
My
code
