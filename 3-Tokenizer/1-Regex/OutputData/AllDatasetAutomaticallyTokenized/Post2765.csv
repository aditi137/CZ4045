I
want
to
do
something
like
this
.
Let's
say
we
have
a
tensor
A
.
And
I
want
to
get
nonzero
values
and
their
indices
from
it
.
There
are
similar
operations
in
Numpy
.
np.flatnonzero(A)
return
indices
that
are
non-zero
in
the
flattened
A
.
x.ravel()
[
np.flatnonzero(x)
]
extract
elements
according
to
non-zero
indices
.
Here's
a
link
for
these
operations
.
How
can
I
do
somthing
like
above
Numpy
operations
in
Tensorflow
with
python
?
(
Whether
a
matrix
is
flattened
or
not
doesn't
really
matter
.
)
