Hello
everyone
","
First
of
all
I
am
a
newbie
to
coding
and
I
am
learning
now
.
So
","
please
excuse
me
for
my
doubt
!
My
data
is
as
follows
:
and
so
on
....
till
Topic
100
with
the
same
format
.
Here
the
first
line
is
the
topic
number
and
it's
weight
.
The
following
are
the
words
in
that
topics
and
their
weights
in
that
topic
.
I
want
to
find
the
probability
of
each
of
the
word
.
That
is
divide
each
of
the
word's
weight
with
it's
respective
topic
weight
.
For
example
","
and
so
on
...
where
these
values
are
the
results
of
the
word's
weight
/
the
topic
weight
.
If
it
is
a
normal
column
division
then
","
I
would
have
used
col2
/
col1
technique
but
this
quite
challenging
.
So
","
please
guide
me
.
Thanks
in
advance
!
