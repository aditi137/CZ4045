I
have
seen
a
number
of
questions
relating
to
writing
files
&
creating
new
directories
using
Python
and
GAE
","
but
a
number
of
them
conclude
(
not
only
on
SO
)
by
saying
that
Python
cannot
write
files
or
create
new
directories
.
Yet
these
commands
exist
and
plenty
of
other
people
seem
to
be
writing
files
and
opening
directories
no
problem
.
I'm
trying
to
write
to
.
txt
files
and
create
folders
and
getting
the
following
errors
:
Case
#
1
:
produces
""""
IOError
:
[
Errno
30
]
Read-only
file
system
:
'
aardvark.txt
'
""""
.
But
i've
checked
and
it's
def-o
not
a
read
only
file
.
Case
#
2
:
produces
""""
OSError
:
[
Errno
38
]
Function
not
implemented
:
'
C:\project\folder
'
""""
What
am
i
missing
?
