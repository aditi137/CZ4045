I
need
to
implement
Django
model
history
version
&
compare
view
.
I
found
there
are
packages
like
django-reversion
","
django-simple-history
","
django-revisions
to
implement
model
history
version
and
django-reversion-compare
for
compare
view
.
My
requirement
focuses
mainly
on
implementing
version
history
&
compare
view
outside
admin
.
Can
someone
share
the
feedback
on
these
packages
?
I
found
few
references
like
"http://treyhunner.com/2011/09/django-and-model-history/,"
but
it's
still
not
clear
to
me
.
I
am
interested
to
know
the
ease
&
limitations
of
implementing
these
packages
.
