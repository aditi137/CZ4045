You
need
django-reversion
+
django-reversion-compare
.
I
have
been
using
django-reversion
for
at
least
5
years
and
django-reversion-compare
is
just
an
add-on
for
django-reversion
","
which
makes
it
possible
to
compare
different
revisions
of
the
same
object
/
record
.
Additionally
see
the
following
grid
.
