Would
something
like
this
work
?
In
the
end
","
you
are
left
with
a
list
of
valid
mctest
lists
.
What
I
changed
:
Used
a
list
comprehension
to
build
the
data
instead
of
a
for
loop
Used
random.randint
to
get
random
integers
Used
slices
and
sum
to
calculate
the
average
of
the
first
three
items
(
To
answer
your
actual
question
:
-
)
)
Put
the
results
in
a
list
mcworks
","
instead
of
creating
a
new
variable
for
every
iteration
