I
was
writing
an
automation
script
in
python
that
dealt
with
sending
commands
through
a
Telnet
session
.
For
some
reason
I
couldn't
get
it
to
work
.
After
a
ton
of
frustrating
debugging
","
I
found
that
when
I
was
translating
a
command
of
:
The
-
in
the
command
became
something
weird
in
utf-8
.
I
had
to
translate
it
in
bytes
because
I
was
sending
it
using
Telnet
(
I
know
I
should
use
ssh
","
but
it
honestly
is
fine
in
my
case
)
and
I
realized
it
was
weird
because
when
I
printed
the
command
in
bytes
it
would
be
:
I
don't
remember
the
exact
numbers
","
but
I
fixed
it
by
copying
and
pasting
a
new
""""
-
""""
that
I
used
two
lines
up
in
the
function
and
worked
fine
.
I
did
copy
and
paste
in
the
part
from
two
lines
up
","
but
I
typed
the
ulimit
-
s
part
.
I
was
also
using
IDLE
Anyone
know
what
happened
?
