Im
writing
some
simple
python
application
using
PyQt
and
QtDesigner
.
I've
designed
mainView
in
designer
which
has
a
QGraphicsView
and
some
buttons
inside
.
My
question
is
","
how
should
I
draw
shapes
on
that
QGraphicsView
?
Without
QtDesigner
","
I
would
have
created
class
extending
QGraphicsView
and
overriden
its
paintEvent()
method
.
However
","
Designer
generates
single
Ui_MainWindow
class
","
so
I
can't
set
it's
QGraphicsView
field
to
my
specific
subclass
.
