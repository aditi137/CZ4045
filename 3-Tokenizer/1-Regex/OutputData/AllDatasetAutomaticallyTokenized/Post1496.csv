I
have
a
Pandas
DataFrame
in
which
the
index
is
(
notice
the
Freq
:
H
)
-
There
are
multiple
columns
but
the
first
few
rows
(
and
others
scattered
throughout
)
have
all
NA
entries
.
If
I
write
this
to
a
HDF
file
thus
:
and
then
read
it
back
with
:
and
look
at
the
index
","
I
see
:
Notice
that
the
Freq
is
now
None
and
also
that
there
are
less
rows
and
a
later
start
date-time
.
The
first
row
is
now
the
first
row
of
the
original
DataFrame
that
contains
at
least
one
non-NA
column
value
.
Firstly
","
is
this
expected
behaviour
due
to
limitations
of
the
HDF5
format
and
how
DataFrames
are
stored
","
or
a
bug
?
Is
there
a
clean
way
to
avoid
this
happening
","
or
do
I
just
need
to
'
fix
'
up
the
index
after
load
.
Not
sure
what
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
either
.
