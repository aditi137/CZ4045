i
coded
a
little
program
and
i
am
currently
in
the
process
of
making
it
work
on
different
operating
systems
.
My
program
heavily
relies
on
the
function
count_nonzero
introduced
with
numpy
version
1.6
.
My
primary
workstation
is
Debian
Linux
with
numpy
(
ver
.
1.6.2
)
and
scipy
(
ver
.
0.11
)
.
However
on
windows
the
setup
could
involve
older
numpy
version
below
1.6
","
where
the
count_nonzero
command
isn't
available
.
Therefore
i
am
in
need
of
a
custom
count_nonzero
function
which
works
on
systems
with
older
numpy
versions
.
"def count_nonzero(self,array):"
How
can
i
achieve
this
?
