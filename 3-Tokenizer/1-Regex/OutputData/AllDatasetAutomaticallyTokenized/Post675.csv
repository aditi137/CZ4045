I
have
a
little
C
program
that's
continuously
acquiring
a
stream
of
data
and
sending
it
via
UDP
","
and
in
real
time
","
to
a
different
computer
.
The
basic
framework
for
what
I
originally
set
out
to
do
has
been
laid
.
In
addition
","
however
","
I'd
like
to
visualize
in
real
time
the
data
that's
being
acquired
.
To
that
end
","
I
was
thinking
of
using
Python
and
its
various
plotting
libraries
.
My
question
is
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
let
Python
have
access
to
what
is
essentially
a
first
in
","
first
out
circular
buffer
of
my
C
program
.
For
concreteness
","
let's
assume
there
are
1024
samples
in
this
buffer
.
Does
the
idea
of
""""
letting
Python
have
a
continuous
peek
at
dynamic
C
array
""""
even
sound
reasonable
/
possible
?
If
not
","
what
sort
of
plotting
options
are
best
suited
to
this
problem
?
Thanks
.
