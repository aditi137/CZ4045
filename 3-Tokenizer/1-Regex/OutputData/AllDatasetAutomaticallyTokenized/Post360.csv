I
found
this
link
a
long
time
a
go
:
http://www.awaretek.com/toolkits.html.
It
suggests
a
tookit
based
on
your
criteria
.
For
me
it
suggests
wxPython
all
the
time
.
Anyway
it
gives
you
a
bunch
of
scores
on
the
various
toolkits
.
What
is
right
for
me
may
not
be
right
for
you
.
But
it
gives
you
how
all
the
tookits
scored
according
to
your
criteria
","
so
if
you
don't
like
the
top
toolkit
for
some
reason
you
can
see
which
ones
are
closest
to
your
criteria
.
QT
/
GTK
/
WxWidgets
(
formerly
wxWindows
)
seem
to
be
among
the
most
mature
cross
platform
GUI
toolkits
.
The
only
issue
is
that
none
is
installed
with
the
default
installation
of
Python
","
so
you
may
have
to
compile
the
libraries
.
If
you
want
something
with
no
installation
required
that
just
runs
","
then
go
with
TKInter
because
as
has
been
mentioned
it
is
installed
by
default
with
Python
.
Anyway
my
criteria
were
9
on
Ease
of
Use
","
10
on
maturity
of
documentation
/
widgets
","
10
on
installed
base
","
5
on
gui
code
generators
","
10
on
native
look
and
feel
for
both
windows
/
linux
and
1
and
5
for
the
last
two
","
I'm
not
big
into
Mac
OSX
(
even
with
a
10
here
it
suggests
wxpython
)
.
