The
most
significant
advantage
I
can
tell
of
spaces
over
tabs
is
that
a
lot
of
programmers
and
projects
use
a
set
number
of
columns
for
the
source
code
","
and
if
someone
commits
a
change
with
their
tabstop
set
to
2
spaces
and
the
project
uses
4
spaces
as
the
tabstop
the
long
lines
are
going
to
be
too
long
for
other
people's
editor
window
.
I
agree
that
tabs
are
easier
to
work
with
but
I
think
spaces
are
easier
for
collaboration
","
which
is
important
on
a
large
open
source
project
like
Python
.
