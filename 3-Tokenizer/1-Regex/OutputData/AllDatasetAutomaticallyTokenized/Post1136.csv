How
do
I
change
the
mode
stdin
is
opened
in
?
Specifically
","
we're
piping
CSV
files
to
the
python
script
to
clean
up
the
data
","
but
with
vertical
tabs
in
the
data
it
seems
to
need
to
be
in
universal-newlines
mode
.
The
problem
data
seems
to
be
some
\
x0b
characters
in
the
input
stream
.
As
printed
by
python
","
after
opening
one
of
the
files
with
'
rU
'
