I
get
two
tables
","
data_table
and
old_data_table
for
example
","
they
contains
exactly
the
same
structure
.
data_table
contains
only
1
month
data
.
say
from
'
2011-10-01
'
to
now
.
old_data_table
contains
the
rest
data
.
Now
if
I
have
to
query
data
between
day
'
2011-09-01
'
to
day
'
2011-10-07
'
","
is
there
a
way
to
query
it
from
both
table
and
combine
results
in
django
?
