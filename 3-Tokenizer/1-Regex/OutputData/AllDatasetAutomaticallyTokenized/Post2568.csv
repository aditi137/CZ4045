There
are
couple
of
issues
with
the
code
.
First
since
you're
using
long
I
guess
you're
running
it
on
Python
2
.
On
Python
2
range
will
generate
a
list
and
you'll
run
out
of
memory
since
problem
description
states
that
max
N
is
10^9
.
You
could
fix
that
problem
by
switching
to
xrange
that
returns
xrange
object
instead
.
If
you
make
the
change
described
above
the
second
issue
would
be
speed
.
Since
max
N
is
10^5
you'd
potentially
have
to
iterate
over
10^14
numbers
which
takes
far
too
long
.
In
order
to
fix
the
used
algorithm
needs
to
be
changed
.
You
can
use
formula
n
*
(
n
+
1
)
*
mul
/
2
to
calculate
the
sum
of
all
multiples
of
mul
in
range
0...n
.
Then
you
solve
a
case
by
just
adding
the
sum
of
multiples
of
3
and
5
and
subtract
multiples
of
15
:
