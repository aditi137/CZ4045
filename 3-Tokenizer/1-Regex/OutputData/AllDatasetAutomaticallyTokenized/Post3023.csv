The
things
like
wx.EVT_KILL_FOCUS
are
not
the
event
object
needed
here
.
Those
are
instances
of
wx.PyEventBinder
which
","
as
the
name
suggests
","
are
used
to
bind
events
to
handlers
.
The
event
object
needed
for
the
PostEvent
or
ProcessEvent
functions
will
be
the
same
type
of
object
as
what
is
received
by
the
event
handler
functions
.
In
this
case
it
would
be
an
instance
of
wx.FocusEvent
.
When
creating
the
event
object
you
may
also
need
to
set
the
event
type
if
that
event
class
is
used
with
more
than
one
type
of
event
.
The
binder
object
has
that
value
to
help
you
know
what
to
use
.
You
usually
also
need
to
set
the
ID
to
the
ID
of
the
window
where
the
event
originated
.
So
for
your
example
","
it
would
be
done
something
like
this
:
...
or
