The
only
way
to
do
such
thing
is
to
create
a
'
generic
'
template
","
that
would
contain
exactly
what
you've
posted
.
Just
pass
the
HTML
variable
to
that
template
(
so
","
yes
","
render
it
normally
)
and
mark
it
with
the
safe
template
filter
.
EDIT
Well
","
sorry
","
it's
not
the
only
way
to
do
this
.
You
could
also
create
a
decorator
that
would
accept
a
HttpResponse
and
wrap
its
content
around
","
or
you
could
even
create
a
middleware
for
this
","
but
the
above
answer
seems
to
be
the
most
simple
one
.
