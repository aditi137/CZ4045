It
looks
like
you've
somehow
got
your
Git
repository
referencing
an
old
(
or
deleted
)
Heroku
application
.
What
you
can
do
most
easily
is
open
up
your
.
git
/
config
file
in
your
project
","
and
switch
out
the
https://git.heroku.com/sleepy-inlet-36834.git/
URL
with
the
correct
one
for
your
Heroku
application
:
https://git.heroku.com/floating-river-39482.git.
Then
give
it
another
go
=
)
To
explain
further
:
Heroku
works
by
using
Git
to
setup
a
'
remote
'
.
Remotes
are
just
places
you
can
push
(
or
pull
)
code
from
.
Git
creates
remotes
by
listing
them
in
your
project's
.
git
/
config
file
.
