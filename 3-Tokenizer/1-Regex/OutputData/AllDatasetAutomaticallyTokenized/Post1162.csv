I'm
currently
using
the
staticfiles_urlpatterns
to
serve
static
files
in
development
","
as
recommended
","
but
I'm
getting
404's
on
the
static
files
for
a
particular
app
I'm
using
and
not
sure
why
...
turning
on
directory
indexes
for
all
the
static
files
would
be
cool
if
its
possible
.
I
noticed
the
'
show_indexes
'
option
for
serving
some
types
of
static
files
.
Is
it
possible
to
write
my
debug-only
url
conf
in
a
way
that
enables
this
across
the
board
for
my
static
files
in
development
?
