They
are
using
pylab's
arange
","
not
simple
python
range
.
And
this
is
the
problem
when
importing
*
:
you
don't
know
which
method
comes
from
where
.
Import
just
pylab
and
reference
to
all
its
methods
/
constants
with
pylab
.
.
You
will
really
love
this
way
of
programming
when
you've
got
several
imports
.
will
work
.
