It
is
impossible
","
because
if
you
get
at
least
one
NaN
value
in
some
column
","
int
is
converted
to
float
.
But
if
use
parameter
fill_value
in
reindex
","
dtypes
are
not
changed
:
Better
is
use
method='ffill
in
reindex
:
If
use
resample
","
you
can
get
column
A
back
by
unstack
and
stack
","
but
unfortuntely
there
is
still
problem
with
float
:
I
try
modify
previous
answer
for
casting
to
`
int
:
