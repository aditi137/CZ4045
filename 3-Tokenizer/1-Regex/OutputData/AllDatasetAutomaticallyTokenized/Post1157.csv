This
is
one
possible
solution
that
doesn't
need
the
explict
index
to
store
the
values
For
cases
in
which
you
need
the
explict
index
using
enumerate(arange(...)
)
is
both
compact
and
readable
.
I'm
not
sure
this
is
the
most
efficient
way
to
build
large
matrices
with
numpy
however
(
if
you
need
some
speed
then
you
should
decompose
the
function
in
multiple
simple
operations
each
one
performed
explicitly
with
numpy
)
.
