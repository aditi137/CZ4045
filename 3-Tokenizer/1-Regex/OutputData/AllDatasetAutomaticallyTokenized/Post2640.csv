One
of
your
problems
is
that
matplotlib's
imshow
using
a
different
coordinate
system
to
what
you
expect
.
Provide
a
origin='lower
'
argument
","
and
the
peaks
now
appear
at
y=0
","
as
expected
.
Another
problem
that
you
have
is
that
fftfreq
needs
to
be
told
your
timestep
","
which
in
your
case
is
8
/
(
N
-
1
)
You
may
say
""""
but
the
frequency
is
10
","
not
0.5
!
""""
However
","
if
you
want
to
sample
a
frequency
of
10
","
you
need
to
sample
a
lot
faster
than
8
/
19
!
Nyquist's
theorem
says
you
need
to
exceed
a
sampling
rate
of
20
to
have
any
hope
at
all
