I'm
pretty
new
to
Pyramid
","
and
I
can't
figure
out
how
to
use
the
autoload=true
option
in
Pyramid
.
I
used
the
pyramid_routesalchemy
to
create
my
project
using
paster
.
The
problem
is
that
there
is
an
init.py
file
which
uses
the
initialize_sql
(
and
this
function
defines
Base.metadata.bind
=
engine
)
.
In
one
of
my
model
classes
I
would
like
to
use
the
autoload=true
option
(
using
the
declarative
base
)
","
but
I
always
get
the
following
error
:
Actually
Base.metadata.bind
=
engine
is
defined
inside
the
initialize_sql
function
and
I
do
not
realy
know
in
which
order
the
file
are
loaded
","
but
I'm
almost
sure
that
that
init.py
is
loaded
before
the
model
","
and
thus
metadata
was
already
binded
to
the
engine
...
Thus
","
my
question
:
how
can
use
autoload
within
my
classes
without
changing
the
whole
init
and
model
structure
?
If
anyone
has
a
hint
...
Thanks
in
advance
