I
ran
into
a
similar
problem
.
Here
is
the
code
I
used
to
get
past
the
issue
.
As
user966588
stated
","
the
directory's
timestamp
is
updating
as
the
directory
changes
.
In
the
post
I
linked
","
I
held
onto
any
directory
metadata
updates
until
after
my
directory
was
fully-populated
in
order
for
the
timestamp
change
to
stay
.
