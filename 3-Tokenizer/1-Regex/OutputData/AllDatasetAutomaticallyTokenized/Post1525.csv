Table
and
database
names
can
not
be
parametrized
.
As
far
as
I
know
","
only
column
values
can
be
parametrized
.
Therefore
","
you'll
need
to
string
formatting
:
Be
sure
that
new_dbname
","
original_dbname
and
owner
do
not
come
from
user
input
","
since
string
formatting
makes
this
code
vulnerable
to
sql
injection
.
