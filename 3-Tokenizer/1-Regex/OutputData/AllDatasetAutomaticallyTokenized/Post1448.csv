Did
you
activate
virtualenv
and
installed
flask
?
flask
should
have
sqlite3
by
default
.
I
got
following
error
though
:
To
fix
that
I
had
to
do
the
following
(
in
Windows
)
:
Change
DATABASE
=
'
/
tmp
/
flaskr.db
'
to
DATABASE
=
'
.
\
\
tmp\\flaskr.db
'
Create
tmp
folder
in
current
folder
(
flaskr
)
Create
an
empty
flaskr.db
file
in
tmp
After
that
it's
working
for
me
.
