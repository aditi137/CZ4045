Meanwhile
","
I
did
a
refined
research
to
verify
what
the
internal
representation
in
Python
is
","
and
also
what
its
limits
are
.
""""
The
Truth
About
Unicode
In
Python
""""
is
a
very
good
article
which
cites
directly
from
the
Python
developers
.
Apparently
","
internal
representation
is
either
UCS-2
or
UCS-4
depending
on
a
compile-time
switch
.
So
Jon
","
it's
not
UTF-16
","
but
your
answer
put
me
on
the
right
track
anyway
","
thanks
.
