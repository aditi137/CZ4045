I
have
strings
about
500
chars
long
and
I'd
like
to
encrypt
them
so
that
resulting
string
has
the
same
length
(
or
just
slightly
different
)
.
I
need
two
way
enryption
and
decryption
using
another
""""
secret
""""
string
known
to
both
sides
.
It
doesn't
need
to
be
very
secure
","
I
prefer
faster
solutions
.
