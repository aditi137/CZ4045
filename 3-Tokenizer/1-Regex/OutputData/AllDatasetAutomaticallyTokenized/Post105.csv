Found
this
question
in
the
process
of
my
own
search
for
a
python
whois
library
.
Don't
know
that
I
agree
with
cdleary's
answer
that
using
a
library
that
wraps
a
command
is
always
the
best
way
to
go
-
but
I
can
see
his
reasons
why
he
said
this
.
Pro
:
cmd-line
whois
handles
all
the
hard
work
(
socket
calls
","
parsing
","
etc
)
Con
:
not
portable
;
module
may
not
work
depending
on
underlying
whois
command
.
Slower
","
since
running
a
command
and
most
likely
shell
in
addition
to
whois
command
.
Affected
if
not
UNIX
(
Windows
)
","
different
UNIX
","
older
UNIX
","
or
older
whois
command
I
am
looking
for
a
whois
module
that
can
handle
whois
IP
lookups
and
I
am
not
interested
in
coding
my
own
whois
client
.
Here
are
the
modules
that
I
(
lightly
)
tried
out
and
more
information
about
it
:

address
lookups
Cons
:

?

Depends
on
:
IPy.py
Cons
:
does
not
seem
to
handle
IP

lookups
Update
:
I
ended
up
using
pywhoisapi
for
the
reverse
IP
lookups
that
I
was
doing
