Yeah
","
the
basic
idea
here
is
that
the
autoloaded
tables
cannot
be
declared
without
a
valid
engine
","
so
you
need
to
separate
your
initialization
code
from
your
model
code
and
ensure
that
the
models
aren't
imported
until
you
have
setup
the
engine
and
connected
it
to
the
metadata
.
The
link
below
describes
it
better
","
but
it
looks
like
you've
already
taken
the
correct
approach
.
