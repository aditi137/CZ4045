I've
compiled
a
Python
screen
saver
on
my
Mac
OS
X
10.7
using
py2app
0.6.3
","
but
when
I
open
the
screen
saver
in
System
Preferences
i
get
the
following
message
:
You
cannot
use
the
Silly
Balls
screen
saver
on
this
computer
.
I've
read
that
this
message
means
it
needs
to
be
compiled
for
64-bit
.
I'm
running
Python
2.7.1
64-bit
on
a
64-bit
system
.
How
can
I
compile
a
64-bit
app
with
py2app
that
makes
the
screen
saver
example
work
?
