There
is
no
moveToThread()
for
processes
since
a
process
lives
in
its
own
memory
space
","
so
it
cannot
see
MainWindow
or
any
of
it
members
.
The
application
that
you
start
using
QProcess
should
be
able
to
execute
as
stand-alone
application
.
To
run
spectra
in
another
QProcess
","
you
will
need
to
make
spectra
a
separate
executable
module
instead
of
MainWindow
member
as
it
is
now
.
EDIT
:
You
need
to
define
the
self-contained
module
that
is
least
dependent
on
the
MainWindow
-
it
can
be
spectra
process
only
","
or
spectra
process
with
tab
.
You
can
pass
info
to
process
either
on
construction
","
or
through
standard
input
","
and
retrieve
data
from
process
through
standard
output
.
Key
idea
when
selecting
lawyer
to
put
process
in
is
to
minimize
communication
and
dependency
between
the
process
and
MainWindow
.
You
may
think
of
a
process
as
simple
C
program
:
int
"main(int argc,char* argv[])"
;
you
can
pass
arguments
on
startup
","
get
additional
input
from
MainWindow
through
cin
/
stdin
if
necessary
","
output
some
results
to
MainWindow
through
cout
/
stdout
/
stderr
(
QProcess
have
interface
for
that
)
.
