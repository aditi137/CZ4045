The
problem
is
that
you're
expecting
input
to
return
you
a
int
which
it
doesn't
do
on
Python
3
.
Python
3
input
works
the
same
way
as
raw_input
on
Python
2
returning
a
string
that
you
need
to
convert
to
other
type
yourself
.
You
should
be
able
to
fix
your
code
by
doing
the
conversions
at
the
required
places
and
switching
all
raw_input
calls
to
input
since
there's
no
raw_input
on
Python
3
.
Example
:
