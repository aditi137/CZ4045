Unfortunately
Satchmo
uses
SORL-Thumbnail
version
3.2.5
","
those
docs
are
for
11
.
My
guess
is
they
didn't
support
formats
in
version
3.x
.
I
haven't
had
any
luck
finding
docs
for
it
but
you
can
probably
dig
through
the
code
to
be
sure
.
If
I
remember
correctly
you
can
swap
out
the
library
for
version
11
","
but
you'll
have
to
go
through
all
the
templates
that
use
the
template
tag
and
add
the
{
%
endthumbnail
%
}
tag
after
each
time
it's
used
(
the
endtag
wasn't
used
back
in
version
3.x
)
.
