So
I
have
a
working
sorting
algorithm
in
Python
.
(
Its
exact
contents
are
irrelevant
to
this
question
.
)
It
uses
a
list
called
'
people
'
containing
class
instances
","
and
the
function
is
hard-coded
to
sort
that
list
by
a
specific
attribute
","
'
wealth
'
.
Now
","
I'd
like
to
generalize
the
function
so
I
could
sort
by
any
attribute
.
But
this
","
of
course
","
throws
an
error
","
because
it
doesn't
know
to
consider
'
wealth
'
as
a
class
attribute
.
So
","
how
is
this
possible
to
do
?
