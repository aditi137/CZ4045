While
going
through
the
documentation
of
django
to
muster
the
detailed
knowledge
","
i
endured
the
word
'
table
level
operation
'
and
'
record
level
operation
'
.
What
is
the
difference
in
between
them
?
Could
anyone
please
explain
me
this
2
word
with
example
?
Does
they
have
other
name
too
?
P.S
I
am
not
asking
their
difference
just
because
i
feel
they
are
alike
but
i
feel
it
can
be
more
clear
to
comprehend
this
way
.
