I
tried
to
install
graph-tool
on
Mac
OSX
10.10
using
homebrew
.
The
brew
build
process
works
fine
","
but
when
I
try
to
import graph
-
tool
I
get
the
error
described
in
this
question
.
Another
problem
with
homebrew
is
that
I
always
builds
graph-tool
for
python2.7
and
it
installs
the
packages
in
the
Python
2.7
sit-packages
folder
.
But
I
want
to
use
it
with
Python
3.4
.
These
are
the
reasons
why
I
tried
to
build
graph-tool
from
source
.
The
.
/
configure
command
automatically
uses
Python
2.7
","
too
.
So
I
passed
it
the
desired
Python
version
with
.
/
configure
PYTHON=python3.4
It
then
detects
the
correct
version
as
well
as
the
related
paths
but
crash
with
the
following
error
:
configure
:
error
:
Could
not
link
test
program
to
Python
.
Maybe
the
main
Python
library
has
been
installed
in
some
non-standard
library
path
.
If
so
","
pass
it
to
configure
","
via
the
LDFLAGS
environment
variable
.
Example
:
.
/
configure
"LDFLAGS=""-L"
/
usr
/
non-standard-path
/
python
/
lib

ERROR
!
You
probably
have
to
install
the
development
version
of
the
Python
package
for
your
distribution

The
exact
name
of
this

The
error
occurs
with
and
without
PYTHON
variable
set
.
From
the
output
of
.
/
configure
I
can
see
that
everything
works
fine
except
for
the
last
line
","
which
says
:
checking
consistency
of
all
components
of
python
development
environment
...
no
Whats
does
the
above
line
mean
and
how
do
I
properly
install
graph-tool
on
my
maschine
?
