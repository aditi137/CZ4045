This
question
keeps
coming
up
when
I
search
for
ipython
change
pwd
even
though
I
am
not
interested
in
a
notebook
","
but
a
terminal
or
qtconsole
.
Not
finding
a
relevant
config
entry
I
tried
:
This
is
the
base
level
shell
class
;
there
are
Terminal
and
Console
(
and
probably
notebook
)
entries
that
could
further
customize
the
action
.
From
the
docs
it
looks
like
import statements
are
most
common
in
the
entry
","
but
it
appears
that
many
magic
commands
work
as
well
.
