I'm
calling
an
iron
python
script
from
c
#
using
This
works
fine
and
using
print
outs
i've
proven
that
the
code
runs
correctly
.
However
inside
the
iron
python
script
is
a
call
to
another
python
script
(
i
have
tried
it
with
just
(
ipython
""""
GenerateKitImages.py
""""
)
THE
ISSUE
:
When
i
run
the
first
iron
python
script
using
Ipy.exe
both
run
perfectly
fine
and
do
as
expected
.
HOWEVER
when
i
run
the
first
iron
python
script
using
the
c
#
script
engine
it
only
runs
the
first
script
and
the
second
script
is
never
called
.
i'm
lost
on
this
one
.
I
can
confirm
it
is
nothing
to
do
with
:
permissions
","
dependencies
.
a
gold
medal
and
pizza
for
the
man
who
can
fix
this
problem
.
