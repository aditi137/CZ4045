Thanks
for
the
Oracle
timings
","
that's
the
kind
of
stuff
I'm
looking
for
(
disappointing
though
:
-
)
Materialized
views
are
probably
worth
considering
as
I
think
I
can
precompute
the
most
interesting
forms
of
this
query
for
most
users
.
I
don't
think
query
round
trip
time
should
be
very
high
as
i'm
running
the
the
queries
on
the
same
machine
that
runs
Postgres
","
so
it
can't
add
much
latency
?
I've
also
done
some
checking
into
the
cache
sizes
","
and
it
seems
Postgres
relies
on
the
OS
to
handle
caching
","
they
specifically
mention
BSD
as
the
ideal
OS
for
this
","
so
I
thinking
Mac
OS
ought
to
be
pretty
smart
about
bringing
the
table
into
memory
.
Unless
someone
has
more
specific
params
in
mind
I
think
more
specific
caching
is
out
of
my
control
.
In
the
end
I
can
probably
put
up
with
200
ms
response
times
","
but
knowing
that
7
ms
is
a
possible
target
makes
me
feel
unsatisfied
","
as
even
20-50
ms
times
would
enable
more
users
to
have
more
up
to
date
queries
and
get
rid
of
a
lots
of
caching
and
precomputed
hacks
.
I
just
checked
the
timings
using
MySQL
5
and
they
are
slightly
worse
than
Postgres
.
So
barring
some
major
caching
breakthroughs
","
I
guess
this
is
what
I
can
expect
going
the
relational
db
route
.
I
wish
I
could
up
vote
some
of
your
answers
","
but
I
don't
have
enough
points
yet
.
