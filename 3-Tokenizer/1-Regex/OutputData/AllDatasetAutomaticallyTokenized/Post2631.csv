I
think
you
more
need
to
explore
on
filtering
algorithms
","
studying
their
usage
","
how
multi
pattern
searching
works
and
how
you
can
use
some
of
those
algorithms
(
their
implementations
are
free
online
","
so
it
is
not
hard
to
find
an
existing
implementation
and
customize
for
your
needs
)
.
Some
pointers
can
be
.
Check
how
grep
family
of
algorithm
works
","
especially
the
bitap
algorithm
and
Wu-Manber
implementation
for
fgrep..Depending
upon
how
accurate
you
want
to
be
","
it
may
require
adding
some
fuzzy
logic
handling
(
think
why
people
use
fukc
instead
of
fuck..right
?
)
.
You
may
find
Bloom
Filter
interesting
","
since
it
wont
have
any
false
negatives
(
your
data
set
)
","
downside
is
that
it
may
contain
false
positives
.
.
