In
your
try_composite
function
","
the
for
loop
should
be
for
i
in
"range(1,s)"
.
Do
not
test
the
case
where
i
is
zero
.
EDIT
:
Also
","
you
are
missing
a
test
in
your
try_composite
function
.
Here
is
my
version
of
the
pseudocode
:
It's
too
bad
that
Python
doesn't
allow
labels
on
break
or
continue
statements
.
Here's
pseudocode
for
a
much
prettier
version
of
the
function
:
Notice
the
two
places
where
the
control
flow
goes
to
next
i
.
There
is
no
good
way
to
write
that
in
Python
.
One
choice
uses
an
extra
boolean
variable
that
can
be
set
and
tested
to
determine
when
to
bypass
the
rest
of
the
code
.
The
other
choice
","
which
I
took
above
","
is
to
write
a
local
function
to
perform
the
task
.
This
""""
loop-and-a-half
""""
idiom
is
convenient
and
useful
;
it
was
proposed
in
PEP
3136
and
rejected
by
Guido
.
