I
am
trying
to
use
Form
Wizard
but
I
can't
figure
out
where
to
set
the
choices
for
the
fields
.
I
see
an
empty
form
that
looks
like
the
admin
panel
for
adding
an
object
.
I
would
like
to
be
able
to
pass
a
question
to
the
form
and
have
the
question
field
filled
out
and
not
editable
and
preferable
not
submitted
.
If
I
do
the
function
get_form_list
has
no
length
Quiz_id
is
unknown
.
so
now
I
am
trying
to
pass
quiz_id
to
the
view
function
and
generate
the
list
of
question
forms
to
be
used
in
the
form
wizard
urls.py
views.py
I
am
getting
the
error
message
Update
based
on
Rohan's
answer
