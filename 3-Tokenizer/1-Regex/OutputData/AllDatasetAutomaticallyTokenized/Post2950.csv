Here's
an
example

the
point
across

to
the
code
you
posted
toward
the
end

your
post
:
result
:
The
two
problems
in
your
code
were
:

you
are
going

df
[

remove
inplace=True
since
that
will
make
it
return
None
.
That
is
your
main
problem
and
why
you
were
getting
all
NaNs
.

it
seems
to
work
here
","
in
general
","
chained
indexing
is
bad
