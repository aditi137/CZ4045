I
am
new
to
django
and
tried
to
fix
this
problem
","
but
couldn't
find
whats
wrong
with
it
.
All
the
validations
of
forms
are
passed
perfectly
","
but
the
image
doesn't
actually
get
uploaded
to
the
media
root
.
I
tried
to
show
images
and
I
only
get
image
icon
instead
of
Image
.
settings
root
part
:
models
code
:
views.py
create(view)
code
:
and
there
also
is
template
code
(
which
is
pretty
huge
and
not
sure
if
it
is
required
)
:
When
I
create
a
file
with
create
view
","
it
doesn't
upload
an
image
to
the
media
/
images
/
vote
.
Why
is
this
happening
?
EDIT
1:added
some
code
Someone
also
told
me
that
I
should
add
this
to
my
code
The
Problem
now
is
that
the
When
I
try
to
get
Image
","
the
program
looks
for
images
at
:
Which
I
think
he
takes
from
my
urls.py
file
.
But
I
dont
get
why
is
the
program
looking
in
/
Vote
/
ID
/
voting
...
instead
of
MEDIA_ROOT
.
Or
does
GET
not
mean
that
it
is
looking
at
that
place
?
This
is
my
Vote

urls.py
:
