I'm
trying
to
use
pyaudio
to
play
some
wave
files
but
I'm
always
having
slow
/
crackling
/
garbled
outputs
.
When
I
play
this
wave
file
as
described
bellow
","
the
audio
plays
just
fine
:
However
","
when
I
open
the
'
play_wave.py
'
example
from
/
pyaudio
/
test
","
the
audio
is
so
slow
and
garbled
that
is
useless
for
any
application
.
To
reproduce
a
similar
poor
quality
on
your
laptop
/
PC
","
just
make
the
CHUNK
=
1
(
the
output
is
pretty
similar
on
my
Ubuntu
)
Additional
information
:
What
I
tried
:
1
-
Another
Raspberry
Pi
B
+
.
2
-
Change
the
audio
samples
per
buffer
:
As
I
was
supposing
the
problem
was
the
audio
samples
per
buffer
(
the
CHUNK
variable
in
this
example
)
","
I
made
a
loop
to
increment
the
CHUNK
by
1
and
played
the
audio
for
each
increment
.
I
could
notice
a
slight
difference
for
some
CHUNK
values
","
but
nothing
even
close
to
the
quality
that
I
get
when
I
play
it
by
aplay
.
However
","
I
could
notice
a
big
difference
between
this
two
files
:
1
-
police_s.wav
=
8
bits
","
22000Hz
","
Mono
","
176
kb
/
s
->
Way
better
than
the
beat.wav
played
by
the
same
CHUNK
(
2048
)
2
-
beat.wav
=
16bits
","
44100Hz
","
Stereo
","
1411
kb
/
s
When
I
play
the
same
audio
through
the
example
/
pyaudio
/
test
/
play_wave_callback.py
","
the
output
is
almost
perfect
","
excepting
some
interruptions
at
the
end
of
the
audio
.
So
I
saw
that
it
doesn't
set
the
CHUNK
.
It
uses
the
frame_count
parameter
in
the
callback
function
","
so
I
printed
it
and
saw
that
it
was
1024
¬
¬
","
the
same
default
value
that
came
with
the
example
/
pyaudio
/
test
/
play_wave.py
and
that
results
in
a
garbled
audio
.

pyaudio
0.2.4
:
Since
hayderOICO
mentioned
he
was
using
pyaudio
0.2.4
and
said
""""
I'm
using
PyAudio
fine
.
""""
","
I
decided
to
give
a
try
on
that
older
version
but
I
got
the
same
result

From
GitHub
:
https://github.com/jleb/pyaudio
It's
very
frustrating
having
the
library's
example
not
working
properly
on
Pi
.
I
don't
think
it's
a
hardware
limitation
since
the
same
audio
plays
well
with
aplay
and
other
libraries
like
pygame
and
SDL2
.
I
am
new
to
Raspberry
Pi
and
audio
programming
","
so
I
hope
to
be
doing
something
stupid
...
As
I
am
already
using
a
specific
wrapper
for
pyaudio
","
I
really
would
like
to
keep
using
it
instead
of
moving
to
another
library
...
I
appreciate
any
help
","
suggestions
and
advice
.
Thanks
in
advance
!
