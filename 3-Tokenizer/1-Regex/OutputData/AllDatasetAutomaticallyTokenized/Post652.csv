Go
to
http://wxpython.org/
and
click
the
Download
link
on
the
left
.
Pick
the
appropriate
binary
that
matches
your
version
of
Python
(
make
sure
you
pay
attention
to
the
32
/
64-bit
part
too
)
.
Once
you
have
the
matching
version
","
install
it
.
That's
it
.
That
has
always
worked
for
me
on
Windows
XP
and
7
.
