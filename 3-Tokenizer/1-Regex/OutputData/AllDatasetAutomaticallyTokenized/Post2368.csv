I
am
writing
a
backup
script
for
a
sqlite
database
that
changes
very
intermittently
.
Here's
how
it
is
now
:
Currently
the
database
weighs
just
shy
of
20MB
","
so
it's
not
that
taxing
when
this
runs
and
reads
the
whole
file
into
memory
(
and
do
it
twice
when
changes
are
detected
)
","
but
I
don't
want
to
wait
until
this
becomes
a
problem
.
What
is
the
proper
way
to
do
this
sort
of
(
to
use
Bashscript
terminology
)
stream
piping
?
