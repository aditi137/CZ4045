Sadly
","
this
is
Windows
","
so
WinPcap
won't
help
;
libpcap
1.1.0
and
later
can
read
pcap-ng
files
","
but
there
is
currently
no
version
of
WinPcap
based
on
a
version
of
libpcap
with
pcap-ng
support
.
I.e
.
","
currently
","
the
first
piece
of
software
to
try
would
be
VirtualBox
","
Parallels
Workstation
","
or
VMware
Workstation
","
and
the
next
piece
of
software
to
try
would
be
some
Linux
distribution
running
on
your
Windows
machine
under
the
virtualization
software
.
Sorry

I
have
to
find
the
time
to
do
some
libpcap
infrastructure
work
to
make
it
easier
for
the
WinPcap
people
to
make
their
remote
capture
support
work
with
newer
versions
of
libpcap
.
Sadly
","
there
are
only
24
hours
in
a
day
","
and
a
ton
of
other
things
to
do
competing
for
the
hours
that
remain
after
such
frivolities
as
eating
and
sleeping
.

A
workaround
for
that
particular
issue
would
be
either
to
save
a
capture
from
Wireshark
in
pcap
format
rather
than
pcap-ng
format
or
to
use
Wireshark
tools
such
as
editcap
(
which
can
handle
pcap-ng
files
on
Windows
","
as
they
don't
use
libpcap
/
WinPcap
to
read
capture
files
)
to
convert
from
pcap-ng
to
pcap
.
There
are
a
couple
of
Python
wrappers
for
libpcap
/
WinPcap
-
python-libpcap
and
Pcapy
.
The
python-libpcap
page
has
a
daemon
and
a
penguin
on
it
","
so
they're
only
advertising
BSD
and
Linux
support
;
it
might
work
on
other
UN*Xes
","
as
there
shouldn't
be
major
differences
in
the
way
you
hook
into
libpcap
","
but
might
not
work
on
Windows
.
Pcapy
","
however
","
explicitly
mentions
WinPcap
and
Win32
binaries
.
