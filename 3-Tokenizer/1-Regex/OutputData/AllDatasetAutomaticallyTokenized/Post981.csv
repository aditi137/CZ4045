I'm
not
experienced
with
strings
","
but
the
version
I
have
(
2.21.51.20110605
)
has
an
8-bit
encoding
option
(
-
eS
)
that
would
work
with
utf-8
text
.
It
must
have
to
cast
a
wide
net
looking
for
'
text
'
delimited
by
non-printable
characters
(
value
<
32
)
.
I'd
expect
a
lot
of
noise
.
A
test
on
a
random
executable
showed
the
-
eS
(
8-bit
)
result
was
5
times
bigger
than
-
es
(
7-bit
)
.
