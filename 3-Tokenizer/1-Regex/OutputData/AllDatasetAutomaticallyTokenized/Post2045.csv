While
it's
not
very
easy
to
tell
if
the
terminal
running
your
script
(
or
the
font
your
terminal
is
using
)
is
able
to
render
a
given
character
correctly
","
you
can
at
least
check
that
the
character
actually
has
a
representation
.
The
character
\
ua62b
is
defined
as
VAI
SYLLABLE
NDOLE
DO
","
whereas
the
character
\
ua62c
has
no
definition
","
hence
why
it
may
be
rendered
as
a
square
or
other
generic
symbol
.
One
way
to
check
if
a
character
is
defined
is
to
use
the
unicodedata
module
:
As
you
can
see
above
","
a
ValueError
is
raised
for
the
\
ua62c
character
because
it
isn't
defined
.
Another
method
is
to
check
the
category
of
the
character
.
If
it
is
Cn
then
the
character
is
not
assigned
:
