I
had
the
same
problem
with
thriftpy
","
the
problem
on
windows
is
an
absolute
path
is
like
C:\foo\bar.thrift
But
","
the
way
the
thrift
library
parses
the
file
","
it
detects
the
C
:
as
if
it
were
a
protocol
like
http:
or
https:
Its
pretty
easy
to
workaround
you
just
have
to
strip
the
first
two
characters
from
the
path
with
a
slice
like
path
[
2
:
]
Just
slice
when
you
call
thriftpy.load
or
in
the
library
file
OR
You
can
go
a
bit
deeper
and
make
the
same
change
that
I
already
submitted
as
a
patch
on
the
github
page
...
perhaps
it
will
be
incorporated
in
the
next
version
of
thrift
.
My
justification
of
why
this
change
is
valid
is
in
the
pull
request
.
If
its
incorporated
then
you
wont
have
to
worry
about
making
the
same
change
again
when
you
update
the
library
.
If
not
then
just
strip
the
two
characters
again
.
