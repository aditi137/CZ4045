Here's
a
transliteration
from
your
solution
to
Python
.
First
","
a
generator
that
creates
Random
numbers
.
This
isn't
very
Pythonic
","
but
it's
a
good
match
with
your
sample
code
.
Here's
a
client
loop
that
collects
a
set
of
5
distinct
values
.
This
is
-
-
again
-
-
not
the
most
Pythonic
implementation
.
It's
not
clear
why
you
want
to
use
a
generator
for
random
numbers
-
-
that's
one
of
the
few
things
that's
so
simple
that
a
generator
doesn't
simplify
it
.
A
more
Pythonic
version
might
be
something
like
:
If
the
requirements
are
to
generate
5
values
and
find
distinct
among
those
5
","
then
something
like
