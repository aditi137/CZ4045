DynamoDB's
Query
operation
only
allows
you
to
specify
the
hash
and
range
keys
.
Scan
will
let
you
provide
other
fields
","
but
it
isn't
recommended
for
general
application
use
.
I'm
not
familiar
with
boto
","
but
if
you
want
to
further
filter
your
results
","
you'll
have
to
query
if
you
can
","
then
post-process
the
results
in
your
application
.
Otherwise
","
you'll
have
to
scan
","
which
would
allow
you
to
use
the
CONTAINS
comparison
on
one
field
at
a
time
.
You
can't
check
both
fields
at
the
same
time
because
the
name
would
have
to
be
found
in
both
fields
","
not
just
one
.
See
the
table
entries
called
ScanFilter
on
the
Scan
page
for
more
information
on
what's
possible
.
