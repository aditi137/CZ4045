All
the
matplotlib
examples
with
hist()
generate
a
data
set
","
provide
the
data
set
to
the
hist
function
with
some
bins
(
possibly
non-uniformly
spaced
)
and
the
function
automatically
calculates
and
then
plots
the
histogram
.
I
already
have
histogram
data
and
I
simply
want
to
plot
it
","
how
can
I
do
that
?
!
For
example
","
I
have
the
bins
(
half
open
ranges
are
denoted
by
the
square
and
curved
bracket
notation
)
","
