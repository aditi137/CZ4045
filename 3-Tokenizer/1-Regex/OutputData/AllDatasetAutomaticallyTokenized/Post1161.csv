Task
at
hand
:
There
is
a
MySQL
table
","
where
a
user
activity
is
pushed
as
a
row
.
That
activity
needs
to
be
processed
later
.
Processing
without
Celery
:
Use
a
script
which
picks
up
N
records
to
process
","
processes
them
and
then
updates
the
status
as
PROCESSED
for
processed
records
.
How
can
the
same
be
achieved
using
Celery
","
I
would
like
to
use
the
same
functionality
to
mark
tasks
instead
of
using
a
broker
?
i.e.
task
add
->
take
10
oldest
rows
added
to
the
mysql
table
with
status
UNPROCESSED
","
which
has
the
task
related
data
as
well
.
on
task
finish
->
mark
the
rows
as
PROCESSED
.
How
can
celery
be
told
that
instead
of
pushing
the
task
onto
the
broker
","
it
has
to
retrieve
tasks
from
the
MySQL
table
?
I
am
a
beginner
at
Celery
","
hence
not
aware
of
all
its
functionalities
.
Using
MySQL
as
broker
is
not
recommended
","
but
I
would
like
to
know
the
feasibility
.
