Note
that
the
use
of
tabs
confuses
another
aspect
of
PEP
8
:
Limit
all
lines
to
a
maximum
of
79
characters
.
Let's
say
","
hypothetically
","
that
you
use
a
tab
width
of
2
and
I
use
a
tab
width
of
8
.
You
write
all
your
code
so
your
longest
lines
reach
79
characters
","
then
I
start
to
work
on
your
file
.
Now
I've
got
hard-to-read
code
because
(
as
the
PEP
states
)
:
The
default
wrapping
in
most
tools
disrupts
the
visual
structure
of
the
code
If
we
all
use
4
spaces
","
it's
ALWAYS
the
same
.
Anyone
whose
editor
can
support
an
80
character
width
can
comfortably
read
the
code
.
Note
:
The
80
character
limit
is
a
holy
war
in
and
of
itself
","
so
let's
not
start
that
here
.
Any
non-sucky
editor
should
have
an
option
to
use
spaces
as
if
they
were
tabs
(
both
inserting
and
deleting
)
","
so
that
really
shouldn't
be
a
valid
argument
.
