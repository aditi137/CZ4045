I
need
some
advice
.
Two
questions
","
does
something
already
exist
for
this
","
what
modules
should
I
use
to
develop
this
.
I
have
some
structures
that
come
from
an
XML
file
.
I
want
to
represent
them
in
Python
Classes
(
maybe
using
a
factory
to
create
a
class
per
structure
)
.
But
I
want
these
classes
to
have
a
function
that
will
emit
the
structure
as
a
C
Struct
.
From
my
research
ctypes
seems
like
the
recommended
thing
to
use
to
represent
the
structures
in
Python
classes
","
but
I
don't
see
any
methods
for
anything
that
will
emit
C
Stucts
for
the
creation
of
a
header
file
.
