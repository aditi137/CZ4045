I
am
working
on
a
taxi
dataset
.
I
want
to
plot
them
on
country
map
.
also
","
after
plotting
the
trajectories
of
the
taxis
","
i
want
the
user
to
choose
a
point
on
the
map
and
request
him
to
enter
an
epsilon
radius
.
After
he
enters
a
value
","
a
circle
should
be
drawn
for
the
user-selected
point
and
points
of
other
taxis
within
that
circle
should
be
engulfed
.
I
should
show
the
user
how
many
taxis
are
participating
in
that
epsilon
radius
.
so
what
sorta
APIs
or
packages
should
i
use
?
Does
basemap
in
python
provide
with
this
kind
of
dynamism
.
Or
is
there
any
other
tool
i
can
use
?
Or
is
there
a
way
","
where
there
are
ready
maps
available
and
i
can
just
plot
my
trajectories
on
them
and
include
them
in
my
web-based
GUI
and
provide
the
user
to
enter
epsilon
radius
and
do
the
same
stuff
as
i
mentioned
above
.
how
to
go
ahead
?
please
suggest
.
