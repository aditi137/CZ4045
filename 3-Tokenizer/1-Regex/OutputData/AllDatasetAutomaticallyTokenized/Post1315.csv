I'm
using
Selenium
to
try
and
get
data
from
a
website
.
But
the
data
I
want
is
stored
in
'
hidden
'
tags
","
so
it's
not
visible
when
I
pull
the
source
.
Is
there
any
way
to
get
around
this
?
Are
there
different
types
of
hidden
?
I
presume
it's
hidden
because
I'm
also
using
Firebug
","
which
can
see
the
source
on
the
page
I'm
trying
to
scrape
","
but
it
'
greys-out
'
that
source
","
which
I've
read
is
an
indication
of
that
source
being
hidden
with
the
style:hidden
tag
.
