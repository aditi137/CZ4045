Here
both
B
and
C
are
derived
from
A
","
but
with
different
__init__()
parameters
.
My
question
is
how
to
write
the
correct
/
elegant
code
here
to
initialize
self.a
","
self.b
","
self.c1
","
self.c2
in
the
following
example
?
Maybe
another
question
is--is
it
a
good
coding
practice
to
do
this
variable
setting
in
__init()
__
function
or
it
is
better
to
use
simpler
__init__()
function
","
and
do
set()
function
for
each
class
later
","
which
seems
not
as
simple
as
to
just
do
it
in
__init()
__
?
