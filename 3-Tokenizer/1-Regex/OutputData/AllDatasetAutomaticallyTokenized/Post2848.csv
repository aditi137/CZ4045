I
have
developed
a
desktop
client
using
PyQt4
","
it
connect
to
my
web
service
by
requests
lib
.
You
know
","
requests
maybe
one
of
the
most
useful
http
client
","
I
think
it
should
be
no
problem
.
My
desktop
client
works
all
right
until
something
strange
happened
.
I
use
the
following
code
to
send
request
to
my
server
.
where
header
only
includes
auth
token
.
I
cannot
connect
to
my
web
service
","
all
the
http
request
pop
the
same
error
""""
'
Cannot
connect
to
proxy
.
'
","
"error(10061, '')"
""""
.
For
example
:
GET
Url
:
http://
api.fangcloud.com
/
api
/
v1
/
user
/
timestamp
"HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.fangcloud.com', port=443)"
:
Max
retries
exceeded
with
url
:
/
api
/
v1
/
user
/
timestamp
(
Caused
by
"ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', error(10061, '')"
)
)
this
API
does
nothing
but
return
the
timestamp
of
my
server
.
When
I
copy
the
url
into
Chrome
in
same
machine
with
same
environment
","
it
returns
correct
response
.
However
","
my
desktop
client
can
only
returns
error
.
Is
it
anything
wrong
with
requests
lib
?
I
googled
this
problem
of
connection
error
10061
(
""""
No
connection
could
be
made
because
the
target
machine
actively
refused
it
""""
)
.
This
maybe
caused
by
TCP
connect
rejection
of
web
server
.
The
client
sends
a
SYN
packet
to
the
server
targeting
the
port
(
80
for
HTTP
)
.
A
server
that
is
running
a
service
on
port
80
will
respond
with
a
SYN
ACK
","
but
if
it
is
not
","
it
will
respond
with
a
RST
ACK
.
Your
client
reaches
the
server
","
but
not
the
intended
service
.
This
is
one
way
a
server
could
“
actively
refuse
”
a
connection
attempt
.
But
why
?
My
client
works
all
right
before
and
Chrome
still
works
.
I
use
no
proxy
on
my
machine
.
Is
there
anything
I
miss
?
