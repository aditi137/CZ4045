As
an
aside
:
When
using
functions
instead
of
methods
","
you
could
also
use
functools.partial
:
The
last
line
will
define
a
function
""""
bar
""""
that
","
when
called
","
will
call
foo
with
the
first
argument
set
to
""""
argvalue
""""
and
all
other
functions
just
passed
on
:
will
call
Unfortunately
that
will
not
work
with
methods
.
