I'm
writing
a
Python
script
that
needs
to
tail
-
f
a
logfile
.
The
operating
system
is
RHEL
","
running
Linux
2.6.18
.
The
normal
approach
I
believe
is
to
use
an
infinite
loop
with
sleep
","
to
continually
poll
the
file
.
However
","
since
we're
on
Linux
","
I'm
thinking
I
can
also
use
something
like
pyinotify
(
https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify
)
or
Watchdog
(
https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog
)
instead
?
What
are
the
pros
/
cons
of
the
this
?
I've
heard
that
using
sleep()
","
you
can
miss
events
","
if
the
file
is
growing
quickly
-
is
that
possible
?
I
thought
GNU
tail
uses
sleep
as
well
anyhow
?
Cheers
