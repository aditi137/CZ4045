Processor
from
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
is
not
allowed
to
edit
context
or
I'm
confuse
?
Even
if
i
subclass
Context
and
try
to
pass
it
to
context_instance
it
does
not
gives
me
acces
to
dictionary
.
It
is
appends
it
right
before
render
.
So
how
do
I
analyze
and
edit
contexts
before
it
gets
rendered
?
UPDATE
:
The
only
way
i
found
is
to
subclass
Context
end
overwrite
update
method
.
