Python's
integers
can
grow
arbitrarily
large
.
In
order
to
compute
the
raw
two's-complement
the
way
you
want
it
","
you
would
need
to
specify
the
desired
bit
width
.
Your
example
shows
-
199703103
in
64-bit
two's
complement
","
but
it
just
as
well
could
have
been
32-bit
or
128-bit
","
resulting
in
a
different
number
of
0xf's
at
the
start
.
hex()
doesn't
do
that
.
I
suggest
the
following
as
an
alternative
:
This
prints
out
:
