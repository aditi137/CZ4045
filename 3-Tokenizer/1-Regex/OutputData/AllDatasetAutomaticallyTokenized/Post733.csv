For
those
(
like
me
)
that
end
up
here
searching
for
autocomplete
in
the
interpreter
:
(
dead
link
was
here
)
This
involves
creating
a
file
.
pythonrc
","
modifying
.
bashrc
and
an
import sys
you
have
to
import every
time
you
launch
the
Python
interpreter
.
I
wonder
if
the
latter
can
be
automated
for
even
more
win
.
