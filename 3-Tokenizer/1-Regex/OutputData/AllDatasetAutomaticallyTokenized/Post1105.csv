I
count
lines
in
python
for
a
text
like
this
:
The
same
text
goes
into
a
textBox
control
.
I
would
like
to
scroll
to
the
last
line
but
the
line
count
does
not
help
","
because
the
textBox
wraps
long
lines
making
them
2
or
more
lines
.
I
can
go
to
the
last
line
by
scrolling
to
-
1
","
but
then
I
cannot
scroll
up
anymore
.
I
need
to
know
the
(
actual
)
max
line
count
so
I
can
scroll
to
any
position
i
want
.
