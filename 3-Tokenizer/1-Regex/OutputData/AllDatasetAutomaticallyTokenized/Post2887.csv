It's
not
outputting
anything
since
your
if
and
else
blocks
are
inside
the
for
loop
which
iterates
over
usernames
.
Since
usernames
is
an
empty
list
","
it's
not
iterating
over
anything
","
hence
not
reaching
any
of
those
conditional
blocks
.
You
might
want
to
put
instead
:
That
will
print
the
last
username
in
the
usernames
list
twice
","
though
.
