In
my
application
","
I
have
two
panels
.
.
class
One
represents
the
sidebar
panel
which
contains
buttons
.
Class
Two
represents
the
main
panel
which
contains
the
listbox
.
How
do
I
call
a
function
via
a
button
(
in
this
case
to
delete
items
from
a
listbox
)
whose
parent
belongs
to
another
class
(
Two
)
?
