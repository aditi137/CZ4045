The
following
example
builds
on
MARTIN
DE
LA
FUENTE
SAAVEDRA's
excellent
work
and
accepted
answer
.
In
particular
","
two
enumerations
are
introduced
.
The
first
allows
for
easy
specification
of
how
an
elevated
program
is
to
be
opened
","
and
the
second
helps
when
errors
need
to
be
easily
identified
.
Please
note
that
if
you
want
all
command
line
arguments
passed
to
the
new
process
","
sys.argv
[0]
should
probably
be
replaced
with
a
function
call
:
subprocess.list2cmdline(sys.argv)
.
