Well
","
the
error
is
telling
you
that
you
are
passing
a
number
in
this
line
:
That
is
too
large
to
be
cast
to
ctypes.c_long
;
The
maximum
number
that
can
be
represented
by
this
type
is
(
2**31)-1
=
2147483647
.
This
is
presumably
your
TOTAL_FRAMES_FLAG
.
Now
that's
a
lot
of
frames
(
approx
.
500
days
@50fps
)
","
so
it
can't
be
right
.
I
notice
that
you
are
getting
this
value
before
you
open
the
video
file
","
so
it's
likely
to
be
undefined
at
that
point
.
Try
doing
it
after
you've
opened
your
file
","
and
see
if
that
fixes
things
.
You
could
print
the
value
","
as
well
","
to
see
if
it
is
indeed
too
large
(
before
you
try
the
suggested
change
)
.
