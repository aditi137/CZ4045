I
am
getting
very
frustrated
trying
to
login
to
costar.com
with
python
and
selenium
.
I
have
tried
it
on
the
chrome
browser
and
firefox
browser
","
but
can't
figure
out
the
correct
code
.
I
have
logged
into
other
websites
","
but
cannot
figure
out
how
to
input
text
into
the
login
boxes
for
this
site
.
Here's
what
I
have
so
far
:
How
is
it
possible
that
there
can
be
a
list
of
elements
","
but
yet
not
have
an
initial
element
?
If
anyone
can
figure
out
how
to
input
text
into
the
username
and
password
text
boxes
of
costar.com
","
I
will
be
greatly
appreciative
.
I
can't
figure
this
out
for
the
life
of
me
!
