When
I
run
:
it
prints
__main__
.
But
when
I
run
:
it
prints
__builtin__
.
How
to
make
the
second
example
to
also
print
__main__
?
What
I
try
to
achieve
is
to
run
a
piece
of
code
with
exec
so
that
from
the
perspective
of
the
it
looks
like
it
was
run
from
command
line
.
I
would
like
to
tun
the
code
with
clean
scope
but
the
second
example
breaks
the
code
relying
on
if
__name__
=
=
""""
__main__
""""
.
How
to
fix
this
?
