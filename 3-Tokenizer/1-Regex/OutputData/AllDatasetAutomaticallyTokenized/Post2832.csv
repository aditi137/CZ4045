I'm
trying
to
implement
convolutional
neural
network
in
Python
.
However
","
when
I
use
signal.convolve
or
np.convolve
","
it
can
not
do
convolution
on
X
","
"Y(X is 3d, Y is 2d)"
.
X
are
training
minibatches
.
Y
are
filters
.
I
don't
want
to
do
for
loop
for
every
training
vector
like
:
So
","
is
there
any
function
I
can
use
to
do
convolution
efficiently
?
