I
have
a
written
a
DLL
in
which
I'm
getting
one
of
the
paths
:
Something
is
being
done
in
the
code
to
get
this
path
.
And
now
","
the
python
script
that
I
have
written
to
retrieve
this
path
from
the
DLL
is
as
shown
:
But
the
value
that
I'm
able
to
see
is
just
the
first
character
of
the
path
instead
of
the
whole
string
.
Can
anybody
help
me
with
this
problem
?
