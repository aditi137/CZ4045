I
have
some
ancient
code
(
5
years
old
)
and
how
I
used
to
access
real_fft()
method
was
this
:
I
guess
the
FFT
module
came
with
NumPy
.
Now
","
years
later
I
installed
the
NumPy
1.6.1
with
And
all
I
see
in
the
docs
"http://www.scipy.org/Numpy_Functions_by_Category,"
are
these
functions
:
fft()
fftfreq()
fftshift()
ifft()
It
is
strange
","
because
in
this
numpy
docs
","
real_fft()
is
there
