I
am
trying
to
use
AFHTTPClient
to
connect
with
a
tornado
server
.
Here
is
my
code
from
client
:
On
the
server
side
","
I
setup
the
handler
as
bellow
:
Then
built
a
subclass
of
this
handler
:
But
when
I
run
this
code
","
it
failed
with
following
ERROR
message
:
The
strange
thing
is
","
in
the
request
header
","
it's
clearly
showing
'
Content-Type
'
:
'
application
/
json
.
Then
why
the
handler
still
has
no
attribute
'
json_args
'
?
I
am
using
tornado
3.0
.
Thanks
you
very
much
if
you
could
give
me
any
advice
.
