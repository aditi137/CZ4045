I'm
completely
stumped
dealing
with
something
quite
simple
.
The
following
lines
are
a
part
of
a
much
much
larger
program
.
Thing
and
stuff
are
two
objects
on
a
grid
","
and
I
need
to
find
the
angle
between
them
","
in
relation
to
the
y-axis
.
math.atan
takes
in
a
floating
point
number
","
which
I
why
I
need
to
type
cast
the
distance
between
the
objects
.
The
.
position
calls
all
return
integers
.
I
get
different
results
while
running
my
program
","
for
each
line
.
The
first
two
should
return
exactly
the
same
result
","
a
float
.
What
I
don't
understand
","
is
how
I
can
possibly
get
different
results
depending
on
whether
I
run
line
1
or
line
2
:
/
This
is
a
part
of
a
simulation
","
