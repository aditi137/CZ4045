Syntax
for
splitting
is
:
"str.split([sep[, maxsplit]])"
'
sep
'
is
the
seperator
used
to
split
strings(by default it matches any white space character)
'
maxsplit
'
argument
can
be
used
to
limit
no
.
of
splits
as
mentioned
by
Tim
Here
if
you
are
using
'
\
t
'
in
between
your
columns
","
you
can
just
use
'
\
t
'
as
seperator
As
per
standard
practice
","
'
\
t
'
is
used
as
seperator
for
columns
so
that
splitting
won't
interfere
with
other
spaces
in
strings
.
And
moreover
there
won't
be
any
compatibility
issues
with
whatever
python
version
you
are
using
.
Hope
this
helps
