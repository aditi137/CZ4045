I'm
sure
there
must
be
an
easy
solution
for
this
","
but
I
have
been
unable
to
find
it
.
I'm
using
Python
Pyramid
in
my
server
and
handling
requests
/
responses
with
AngularJS
in
Javascript
.
I'm
using
the
Pyramid
HTTP
errors
to
handle
some
cases
","
and
I'm
able
to
catch
them
using
the
Angular
http.error()
statement
.
But
this
is
where
I'm
stuck
","
I
want
to
do
something
with
the
error
messages
but
if
I
log
the
response
I
just
see
html
code
.
In
Pyramid
this
is
happening
:
And
in
Angular
:
How
would
I
get
that
specific
error
message
from
the
HTTP
error
?
(
I'm
using
JSON
as
my
renderer
btw
)
