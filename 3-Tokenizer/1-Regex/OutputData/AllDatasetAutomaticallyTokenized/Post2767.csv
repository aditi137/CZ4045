I
am
trying
to
export
to
CSV
files
from
a
Jupyter
notebook
.
Even
when
I
test
examples
copy-pasted
from
the
documentation
(
see
below
)
","
I
get
a
""""
'
str
'
object
is
not
callable
""""
error
message
.
I
have
fiddled
endlessly
with
the
parameters
.
The
same
thing
happens
with
a
Pandas
dataframe
and
I
try
to
use
to_csv
.
Basically
:
yields
I'm
new
to
coding
","
so
I
don't
really
know
how
to
troubleshoot
past
this
point...can
anyone
help
?
