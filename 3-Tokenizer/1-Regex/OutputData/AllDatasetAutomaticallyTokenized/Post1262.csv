In
the
Documentation
of
the
python3
pickle
module
it
says
:
""""
The
pickle
module
is
not
intended
to
be
secure
against
erroneous
or
maliciously
constructed
data
.
Never
unpickle
data
received
from
an
untrusted
or
unauthenticated
source
.
""""
What
is
the
risk
of
unpickling
data
from
untrusted
sources
?
Is
the
unpickling
of
untrusted
data
itself
dangerous
?
Or
is
it
only
dangerous
to
use
the
unpickled
object
?
So
is
it
safe
to
unpickle
untrusted
data
and
then
(
before
doing
anything
with
the
resulting
object
)
proving
wether
it's
a
save
object
?
