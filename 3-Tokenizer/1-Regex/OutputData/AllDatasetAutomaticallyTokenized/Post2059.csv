Suppose
I
have
the
code
below
:
I
can
initialize
the
data
:
But
I
have
a
feeling
that
the
display_userdata()
function
is
redundant
if
I
could
re-write
__init
to
store
as
dict
.
It
returns
the
output
:
My
questions
are
:
Is
there
a
smarter
way
to
write
the
__init__
snippet
so
the
input
is
stored
directly
as
python
dictionary
?
I
don't
want
to
call
the
constructor
with
dict
key
by
using
setattr
.
Secondly
","
Suppose
the
user
has
3
phones
or
more
(
variable
)
","
how
do
I
store
this
in
an
array
while
calling
the
object
constructor
.
Think
self.phone
=
[
'
702-000-000
'
","
'
413-222-3333
'
]
