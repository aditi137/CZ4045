So
","
as
far
as
I
understand
","
the
ManyToManyField
in
the
Section
class
doesn't
actually
save
any
DocumentType
data
in
the
Section
database
table
","
rather
it
saves
the
relationship
to
DocumentType
.
Therefore
if
I
want
to
access
the
document_type
of
a
section
I
have
to
look
up
the
Section
objects
via
the
DocumentType
object
","
and
vice
versa
.
For
instance
:
or
:
or
:
Although
this
:
raises
ValueError
:
invalid
literal
for
int()
with
base
10
:
'
WAN
'
because
there
is
no
data
under
the
section_document_type
m2m
field
","
only
the
relationship
.
So
this
is
still
the
case
:
