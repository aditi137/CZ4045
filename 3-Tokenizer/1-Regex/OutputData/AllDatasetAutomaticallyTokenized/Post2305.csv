I
have
an
SQLite
database
with
3
tables
.
Each
of
these
tables
have
two
columns
:
name
and
value
such
that
all
the
tables
have
the
same
records
(
name
)
but
different
values
.
How
do
I
select
the
records
that
are
a
part
of
least
sum
of
values
spanning
across
these
tables
such
that
the
record
names
are
unique
?
Names
:
Steven
","
Jamie
","
Michael
","
Jordan
","
Gary
Values
(
in
the
order
of
names
)
Table
1
:
1
","
2
","
3
","
4
","
5
Table
2
:
2
","
3
","
1
","
5
","
6
Table
3
:
9
","
0
","
2
","
11
","
3
The
output
should
return
(
Steven
","
Michael
","
Jamie
)
because
the
sum
of
the
values
in
this
case
would
equal
to
2
which
would
be
the
least
possible
.
