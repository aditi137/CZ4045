Assuming
your
using
mod_python
:
Or
:
http://www.modpython.org/live/current/doc-html/pyapi-mprequest-mem.html
content_type
String
.
The
content
type
.
Mod_python
maintains
an
internal
flag
(
req._content_type_set
)
to
keep
track
of
whether
content_type
was
set
manually
from
within
Python
.
The
publisher
handler
uses
this
flag
in
the
following
way
:
when
content_type
isn't
explicitly
set
","
it
attempts
to
guess
the
content
type
by
examining
the
first
few
bytes
of
the
output
.
If
you
just
want
to
have
pretty
xml
output
in
a
text
file
","
use
BeautifulSoup
prettify()
on
the
xml
.
