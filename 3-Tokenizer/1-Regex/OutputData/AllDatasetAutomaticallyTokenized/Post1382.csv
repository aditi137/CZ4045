There
doesn't
seem
to
be
anything
like
this
built
into
Python
by
default
unfortunately
.
There
are
several
answers
but
I
though
I'd
add
one
using
iterators
.
If
changing
in
place
is
acceptable
","
that's
going
to
be
fastest
.
If
you
don't
want
to
change
the
original
and
just
want
to
loop
over
a
filtered
set
","
this
should
be
pretty
fast
:
Implementation
:
Usage
:
So
it
is
a
generator
-
you'll
need
to
call
list
or
something
to
make
it
permanent
.
If
you
only
ever
want
to
remove
a
single
index
","
you
can
of
course
make
it
even
faster
by
using
k
=
=
remove_index
instead
of
a
set
.
