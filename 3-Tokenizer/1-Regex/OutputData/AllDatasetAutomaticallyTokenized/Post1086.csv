I
did
a
pretty
fair
bit
of
scouring
","
yet
could
not
find
anything
useful
which
answers
my
questions
.
Either
that
or
I
am
asking
the
wrong
questions
.
I
am
trying
to
make
a
web
application
which
gives
a
user
a
graphical
view
of
the
server
desktop
.
I
have
understood
that
somewhere
in
here
X
engine
has
to
be
invoked
and
I
have
also
understood
that
this
is
not
something
that
php
can
accomplish
primarily
because
its
a
language
which
processes
before
sending
requests
","
please
correct
me
if
I
am
wrong
in
this
regard
.
You
may
say
that
what
I
am
trying
to
accomplish
is
something
akin
to
what
teamviewer
does
only
on
the
web
.
My
dilemma
is
whether
I
should
be
using
python
or
java
for
this
task
","
both
would
be
pretty
apt
for
the
task
","
but
which
one
would
be
better
?
Please
give
your
suggestions
