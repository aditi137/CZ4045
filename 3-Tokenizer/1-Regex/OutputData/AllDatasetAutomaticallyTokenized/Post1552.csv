I
believe
the
try-catch
mentioned
in
a
similar
post
here
on
SO
could
be
adapted
to
cover
it
.
If
you
wrap
the
pool.map
call
in
the
try-catch
and
then
call
terminate
and
join
I
think
that
would
do
it
.
[Edit]
Some
experimentation
suggests
something
along
these
lines
works
well
:
I
simplified
your
example
somewhat
to
avoid
having
to
load
numpy
on
my
machine
to
test
but
the
critical
part
is
the
two
try-except
calls
which
handle
the
CTRL+C
key
presses
.
