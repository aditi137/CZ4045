IDE
:
PyCharm
Community
Edition
3.1.1
Python
:
2.7.6
I
using
DDT
for
test
parameterization
http://ddt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example.html
I
want
to
choose
and
run
parameterized
test
method
from
test
class
in
PyCharm
->
see
example
:
When
I
navigate
to
the
first
test
method
test_print_value
in
code
and
hit
ctrl+Shift+F10
(
or
use
Run
Unittest
test_print
...
option
from
context
menu
)
then
test
is
executed
.
When
I
try
the
same
with
parameterized
test
I
get
error
:
And
output
contains
:
However
when
I
run
all
tests
in
class
(
by
navigating
to
test
class
name
in
code
and
using
mentioned
run
test
option
)
all
parameterized
and
non
parameterized
tests
are
executed
together
without
errors
.
The
problem
is
how
to
independently
run
prameterized
method
from
the
test
class
-
workaround
is
putting
one
parameterized
test
per
test
class
but
it
is
rather
messy
solution
.
