Both
actions
will
occur
.
When
you
click
on
a
radiobutton
","
first
the
variable
will
change
its
value
","
and
after
that
the
event
handler
passed
as
command
option
is
called
if
present
.
Also
your
example
would
not
work
","
since
add_radiobutton
doesn't
allow
the
onvalue
and
offvalue
options
-
only
value
.
