When
using
the
if
at
the
end
of
the
for
","
it
restricts
which
items
are
considered
","
so
that
version
will
only
return
one
item
","
since
only
one
item
in
the
source
list
matches
the
condition
.
Also
in
this
case
you
don't
need
to
use
replace
","
you
could
just
use
""""
hello
""""
if
cell
=
=
""""
-
-
""""
instead
","
but
you
would
use
this
form
if
you
had
multiple
items
you
wanted
to
manipulate
.
