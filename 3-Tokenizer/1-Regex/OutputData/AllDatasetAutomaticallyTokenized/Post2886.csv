I'm
currently
trying
to
teach
myself
Python
with
the
Python
Crash
Course
book
by
Eric
Matthes
and
I
seem
to
be
having
difficulties
with
excercise
5-9
regarding
using
if
tests
to
test
empty
lists
.
Here
is
the
question
:
5-9
.
No
Users
:
Add
an
if
test
to
hello_admin.py
to
make
sure
the
list
of
users
is
not
empty
.
•
If
the
list
is
empty
","
print
the
message
We
need
to
find
some
users
!
•
Remove
all
of
the
usernames
from
your
list
","
and
make
sure
the
correct
message
is
printed
.
Here
is
my
code
from
hello_admin.py
:
Now
here
is
my
code
for
5-9
which
is
not
outputting
anything
:
Does
anyone
having
any
feedback
for
why
my
code
is
not
outputting
:
""""
We
need
to
find
some
users
!
""""
Thank
you
for
your
time
.
