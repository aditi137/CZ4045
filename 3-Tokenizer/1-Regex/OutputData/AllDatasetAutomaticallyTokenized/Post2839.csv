If
you
set
the
attribute
on
new_func
instead
","
you
can
access
it
simply
as
decorated_function.some_attr
:
Otherwise
","
wraps
makes
the
original
function
available
as
decorated_function.__wrapped__
in
Python
3
:
In
Python
2
","
the
__wrapped__
is
not
set
by
wraps
","
so
we
need
to
set
it
up
manually
:
However
","
this
sounds
like
an
XY
problem
;
if
you
want
to
pass
a
value
to
the
decorated_function
you
should
let
decorator_
pass
it
as
an
argument
instead
.
