I
have
found
this
line
of
code
to
send
inputs
to
the
network
in
caffe
:
I
tried
adapting
this
code
for
my
work
as
follows
:
where
im_proc
=
"np.zeros((100,9)"
)
(
just
for
testing
)
but
I
get
the
following
error
:
I
am
unable
to
understand
why
I
cant
run
the
forward
method
this
way
.
I
am
able
to
call
net.forward()
regularly
though
.
From
the
comments
I
understand
that
I
am
supposed
to
initialize
the
input
array
with
possibly
the
caffe.io.Transformer
function
.
I
tried
the
following
loop
:
But
this
still
causes
the
same
error
.
