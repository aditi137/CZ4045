So
Here
is
my
problem
.
I
want
to
check
if
a
site
has
had
any
recent
comments
done
on
it
.
Usually
wordpress
sites
have
their
comment
feed
in
this
pattern
www.site.com
/
comments
/
feed
Now
the
problem
is
each
wp
site
can
be
in
many
formats
of
rss
or
atom
with
different
fields
.
I
am
currently
working
on
the
logic
on
how
I
can
tell
if
there
has
been
a
new
update
.
Any
ideas
Reference
sites
with
different
formats
in
Rss
and
Atom
feeds
:
cheers
