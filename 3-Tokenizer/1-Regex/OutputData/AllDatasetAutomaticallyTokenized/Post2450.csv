The
aim
of
this
program
is
to
show
the
tradeWindow
as
a
QWidget
and
then
show
a
QDialog
each
time
doStuff
is
called
(
via
button
)
if
there
are
results
.
The
code
works
first
time
","
but
second
time
i
get
error
messages
:
It
seems
my
layout
gets
deleted
when
i
close
QDialog
the
first
time
.
Moving
popLayout
=
QHBoxLayout()
to
start
of
doStuff
which
I
thought
would
fix
the
problem
gives
me
this
error
instead
:
That
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me
at
all
since
it
should
always
be
getting
defined
before
being
referenced
?
I
can't
find
the
problem
anyway
.
I'm
sure
a
lot
of
my
code
could
be
improved
as
well
as
I
am
very
new
to
classes
etc.
If
you
have
any
tips
on
how
to
open
the
QDialog
each
time
that
is
better
than
what
I'm
currently
trying
or
other
helpful
tips
","
please
don't
hesitate
to
mention
that
as
well
.
(
Try
to
ignore
the
crappy
naming
convention
","
I
will
fix
that
in
the
future
.
)
Thank
you
for
any
help
!
