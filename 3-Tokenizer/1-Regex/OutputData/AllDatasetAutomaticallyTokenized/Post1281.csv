There
are
multiple
problems
here
:
Your
JSON
data
is
actually
multiple
JSON
datas
.
That
will
be
hard
to
fix
if
you
have
a
lot
of
data
","
although
Martijns
suggestion
of
reading
per
line
might
help
","
assuming
the
data
really
is
one
JSON
mapping
per
line
.
Otherwise
the
data
needs
to
be
fixed
","
like
this
:
Note
the
opening
and
closing
brackets
","
and
the
comma
after
each
JSON
{
}
(
except
the
last
one
)
.
The
script
you
have
been
given
is
not
particularly
generic
.
It
assumes
there
is
an
'
item_id
'
in
the
first
JSON
object
given
","
which
there
is
not
.
That's
fixable
","
though
.
Your
invoice_payments
data
is
a
list
of
dictionaries
.
This
means
your
data
is
hierarchical
.
How
do
you
want
to
convert
to
CVS
","
which
is
just
a
flat
list
of
data
?
It's
not
obvious
.
The
script
you
show
doesn't
deal
with
that
","
it's
generic
and
assumes
your
json
data
is
flat
.
A
fixed
converter
:
yields
this
result
as
CSV
:
Note
how
your
invoice_payments
data
has
been
converted
to
a
string
:
Nothing
that
imports
CSV
will
make
any
practical
sense
of
that
.
Your
JSON
data
can
not
be
trivially
converted
to
CSV
","
you
have
to
decide
and
specify
how
the
CSV
data
should
look
.
