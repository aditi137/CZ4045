This
what
I
asked
to
do
:
"save_friends(filename, friends_list)"
takes
a
file
name
and
a
friends
list
and
writes
that
list
to
thefile
in
the
correct
format
.
So
","
for
example
","
"save_friends('friends.csv', load_friends('friends.csv')"
)
should
overwrite
the
friends
le
with
exactly
the
same
content
.
This
is
my
code
:
The
problem
is
when
I
run
the
text
code(a code provided by school that dose some simple tests)
","
it
tells
me
So
","
how
can
I
return
'
None
'
while
the
input
is
not
really
a
list(Like the input 'd' in this circumstance)
?
