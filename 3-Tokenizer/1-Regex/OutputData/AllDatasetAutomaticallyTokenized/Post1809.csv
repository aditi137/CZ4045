I
have
a
list
(
actually
I'd
like
to
make
it
a
1D
numpy
array
)
whose
first
and
last
element
will
remain
constant
but
whose
other
elements
are
objects
of
an
optimisation
","
i.e
will
change
often
and
need
to
be
in
a
separate
variable
(
because
scipy.optimize.leastsq()
needs
it
that
way
)
.
So
I've
got
this
code
to
put
the
constant
""""
outer
""""
elements
together
with
the
changing
ones
:
This
looks
very
unelegant
to
me
","
and
I'm
convinced
there
must
be
a
way
to
do
this
in
just
one
line
that
defines
For
background
","
I
need
this
because
I
have
an
error
function
for
leastsq
that
takes
a
1D
array
of
which
only
the
inner
elements
are
optimized
.
I
am
feeding
the
result
of
the
above
to
a
lambda
function
","
together
with
other
parameters
to
the
error
function
","
so
that
I
can
pass
only
the
stuff
that
changes
to
leastsq
:
because
I
am
using
the
same
error
function
for
different
types
of
optimisation
(
there
are
different
aspects
and
different
types
of
constraints
that
the
function
can
be
fitted
to
)
","
I
do
not
want
to
re-write
the
error
function
for
a
specific
purpose
.
