I
need
some
major
improvements
in
my
programming
/
coding
and
it's
already
been
a
month
of
this
computer
language
field
.
Right
now
I'm
trying
to
create
a
class
with
3
functions
(
lunch
","
breakfast
","
and
dinner
)
and
let's
say
I
want
to
call
the
function
lunch
and
add
'
Strawberry
'
to
the
lunch
list
;
it's
supposed
to
add
1
to
the
list
count
(
list_count
)
for
amount
of
foods
entered
in
the
list
count
so
far
","
and
adds
'
strawberry
'
to
the
dictionary
.
So
what
I'm
trying
to
do
is
I
created
a
blank
dictionary
list
(
lunch_list
)
and
created
a
starting
count
of
food
items
(
lunch_count
)
So
if
I
call
lunch
in
the
Food
class
","
I'm
trying
to
make
the
result
like
this
:
I
was
ready
to
write
this
script
but
after
writing
this
I
confused
myself
a
lot
more
.
I
feel
lost
.
This
is
going
to
be
embarassing
for
me
but
here
is
my
code
:
