I
have
a
function
in
a
superclass
that
returns
a
new
version
of
itself
.
I
have
a
subclass
of
this
super
that
inherits
the
particular
function
","
but
would
rather
it
return
a
new
version
of
the
subclass
.
How
do
I
code
it
so
that
when
the
function
call
is
from
the
parent
","
it
returns
a
version
of
the
parent
","
but
when
it
is
called
from
the
child
","
it
returns
a
new
version
of
the
child
?
