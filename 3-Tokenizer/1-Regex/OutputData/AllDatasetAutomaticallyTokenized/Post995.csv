I
am
trying
to
get
Python
to
run
to
use
with
Blender
.
I
have
64
bit
Vista
SP2
.
2.6.7
Python
.
When
I
start
python
the
command
prompt
tells
me
this
So
","
I
opened
pypm-script.py
This
is
very
frustrating
","
because
have
no
idea
how
to
read
code
or
how
to
use
Python
!
I
hope
this
is
easily
fixable
.
