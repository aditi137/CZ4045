I
was
working
on
a
Tkinter
GUI
with
a
status
bar
at
the
bottom
to
display
instructions
or
the
file
paths
on
hover
over
a
specific
widget
","
especially
if
the
file
path
was
too
long
to
write
in
the
given
section
.
Is
there
any
way
that
the
status
bar
could
extends
past
the
window
in
the
case
of
a
long
name
?
(
Like
maybe
a
window
without
the
top
bar
?
)
The
status
bar
is
cut
off
at
the
end
:
What
I
want
the
status
bar
to
look
like
:
I've
seen
other
applications
where
the
status
bar
can
extend
past
the
window
but
I
was
wondering
if
that
was
possible
in
Tkinter
.
Any
help
would
be
appreciated
!
