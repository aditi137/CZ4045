I
installed
cache-machine
for
my
Django
1.6
project
as
described
here
:
http://cache-machine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
Now
in
django's
admin
","
I
cannot
see
new
entries
anymore
.
Cache
invalidation
does
not
work
.
I
can
see
that
the
entry
is
beeing
generated
in
the
DB
","
but
it
does
not
show
up
in
admin's
list-view
.
What
am
I
doing
wrong
?
Thx
in
advance
!
