I
have
a
simple
python
script
however
it
displays
a
much
higher
execution
time
when
it's
run
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
.
If
I
execute
it
immediately
after
it's
faster
by
a
few
factors
.
This
script
is
run
on
a
private
test
server
with
no
applications
running
on
it
so
I
don't
think
a
lack
of
system
resources
is
what
is
causing
it
to
run
slower
.
Can
anyone
explain
the
variance
in
the
execution
time
?
I've
ran
similar
tests
for
php
scripts
that
include
external
scripts
and
there's
negligible
variance
in
the
execution
time
of
that
script
.
This
variance
affects
my
application
because
such
scripts
are
called
several
times
and
cause
the
response
to
be
delivered
between
70ms
and
450ms
.
