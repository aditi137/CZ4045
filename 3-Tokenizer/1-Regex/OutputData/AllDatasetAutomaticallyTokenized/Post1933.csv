What
others
have
said
about
not
doing
circular
imports
is
the
best
solution
","
but
if
you
end
up
absolutely
needing
them
","
it's
usually
within
just
one
method
or
function
of
one
of
the
modules
.
Thus
you
can
safely
do
this
:
There's
a
slight
overhead
to
doing
the
import each
time
the
function
is
called
","
but
it
is
rather
low
unless
it's
called
all
the
time
.
