I'm
running
Django
1.0
and
I'm
close
to
deploying
my
app
.
As
such
","
I'll
be
changing
the
DEBUG
setting
to
False
.
With
that
being
said
","
I'd
still
like
to
include
the
stacktrace
on
my
500.html
page
when
errors
occur
.
By
doing
so
","
users
can
copy-and-paste
the
errors
and
easily
email
them
to
the
developers
.
Any
thoughts
on
how
best
to
approach
this
issue
?
