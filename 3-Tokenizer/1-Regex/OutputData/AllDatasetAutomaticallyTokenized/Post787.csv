once
again
","
a
bit
surprised
not
to
find
an
answer
to
this
one
...
the
real-world
reason
for
my
asking
is
:
I
have
a
dictionary
of
constants
in
a
class
and
I
want
a
dictionary
so
I
can
find
the
constant
if
given
the
number
...
easy
enough
:
...
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
make
this
a
@static
method
of
MySQLConstants
and
call
it
by
going
MySQLConstants.createDic()
","
after
the
class
definition
statement
has
executed
...
but
I
was
just
wondering
whether
there's
any
way
to
get
a
method
","
inevitably
@static
","
to
run
when
a
class
(
NB
I'm
not
talking
about
creating
an
instance
of
this
class
!
)
is
created
...
