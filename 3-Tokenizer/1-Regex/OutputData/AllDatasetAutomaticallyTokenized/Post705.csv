As
often
happens
","
you're
not
really
asking
about
the
problem
you
actually
need
to
solve
:
you've
done
things
in
a
certain
(
wrong
)
way
","
and
are
asking
about
how
to
get
yourself
out
of
the
problem
you've
got
yourself
into
.
If
I
understand
you
correctly
","
you've
got
a
set
of
fields
-
amount_paid
","
paid_date
","
method
","
comments
-
and
each
field
appears
multiple
times
on
the
form
","
so
you've
got
one
set
of
values
for
each
entry
.
You're
presumably
trying
to
sort
these
into
a
list
of
dicts
for
each
row
.
Well
","
this
is
not
the
right
way
to
go
about
it
in
Django
.
You
should
be
using
formsets
","
which
give
you
one
form
for
each
row
in
a
table
-
ie
","
exactly
what
you
want
to
achieve
.
