I
need
to
use
my
aliases
from
~
/
.
bashrc
on
IPython
.
First
I've
tried
but
it
didn't
work
According
to
this
post
we
should
do
It
takes
20
sec
to
run
on
Jupiter
and
I
get
:
bash
:
line
2
:
f2py3
:
command
not
found
My
~
/
.
bashrc
file
looks
like
bash
:
line
2
:
type
:
f2py3
:
not
found
Neither
alias
","
source
","
nor
%
rehashx
%
work
I
actually
found
that
the
problem
is
Python
","
who
can't
execute
alias
command
neither
with
sh
nor
bash
.
Can
I
use
alias
with
IPython
magics
?
