Im
not
sure
if
this
is
what
you
are
looking
for
","
but
we
write
our
main
application
with
Java
at
the
small
company
I
work
for
","
but
have
used
python
to
write
smaller
scripts
quickly
.
Backup
software
","
temporary
scripts
to
manipulate
data
and
push
out
results
.
It
just
seems
easier
sometimes
to
sit
down
with
python
and
write
a
quick
script
than
mess
with
classes
and
stuff
in
java
.
Temp
scripts
that
aren't
going
to
stick
around
don't
need
a
lot
of
design
time
wasted
on
them
.
And
I
am
lazy
","
but
it
is
good
to
just
learn
as
much
as
you
can
of
course
and
see
what
features
exist
in
other
languages
.
Knowing
more
never
hurts
you
in
future
career
changes
