openpyxl
is
guaranteed
to
write
xlsx
files
.
From
a
cursory
read
through
some
of
the
xlwt
code
and
docs
/
examples
","
I
don't
think
xlwt
supports
xlsx
.
If
openpyxl
does
what
you
need
it
to
do
","
why
look
elsewhere
?
Edit
:
with
xlwt
version
0.7.4
I
attempted
to
save
a
file
as
sample.xlsx
.
Upon
attempting
to
open
it
I
got
a
not
valid
error
message
","
so
no
.
xlsx
files
for
now
.
