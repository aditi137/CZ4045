Perl
is
heavily
optimized
for
text
processing
.
There
are
so
many
factors
that
it's
hard
to
say
what's
the
exact
difference
.
Text
is
represented
completely
differently
internally
(
utf-8
versus
utf-16
/
utf-32
)
and
the
regular
expression
engines
are
completely
different
too
.
Python's
regular
expression
engine
is
a
custom
one
and
not
as
much
used
as
the
perl
one
.
There
are
very
few
developers
working
on
it
(
I
think
it's
largely
unmaintained
)
in
contrast
to
the
Perl
one
which
is
basically
the
""""
core
of
the
language
""""
.
After
all
Perl
is
the
text
processing
language
.
