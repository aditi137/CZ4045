I
seems
found
a
bug
when
I'm
using
python
2.7
with
numpy
module
:
Here
I
got
the
full
'
x
'
array
as
follows
:
Then
I
try
to
indexing
single
row
values
in
sheet
[1]
:
Result
:
But
something
wrong
while
I
was
try
to
indexing
single
column
in
sheet
[1]
:
Result
still
be
the
same
as
previous
:
Should
it
be
"array([20, 25, 30, 35])"
?
?
It
seems
something
wrong
while
indexing
the
middle
index
with
range
?
