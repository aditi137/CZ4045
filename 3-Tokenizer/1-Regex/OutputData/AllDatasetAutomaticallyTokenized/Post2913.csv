If
you
check
the
implementation
of
get_context_name()
","
you'll
see
this
:
And
the
implementation
for
get_context_data()
(
from
SingleObjectMixin
)
:
So
you
can
see
that
get_context_data()
adds
to
the
dictionary
an
entry
with
the
key
context_object_name
(
from
get_context_object_name()
)
which
returns
obj._meta.model_name
when
self.context_object_name
isn't
defined
.
In
this
case
","
the
view
got
self.object
as
a
consequence
of
the
call
to
get()
which
calls
get_object()
.
get_object()
takes
the
model
that
you've
defined
and
automatically
queries
it
from
your
database
using
the
pk
you've
defined
in
your
urls.py
file
.
http://ccbv.co.uk/
is
a
very
good
website
for
seeing
all
of
the
functions
and
attributes
the
class
based
views
of
Django
has
to
offer
in
a
single
page
.
