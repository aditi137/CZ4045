I
have
some
code
for
a
plot
I
want
to
create
:
In
this
plot
the
x
and
y
axis
are
moved
.
However
","
the
origin
is
not
moved
with
then
","
as
one
can
see
from
the
ticks
and
ticklabels
.
How
can
I
always
move
the
origin
with
the
x
and
y
axis
?
I
guess
it
would
be
the
same
as
simply
looking
at
another
area
of
the
plot
","
so
that
the
x
and
y
axis
are
at
the
lower
left
but
not
in
the
corner
as
they
usually
are
.
To
visualize
this
:
What
I
want
:
Where
the
arrow
points
to
the
x
and
y
axis
intersection
","
I
want
to
have
the
origin
","
(
0|0
)
.
Where
the
dashed
arrow
points
upwards
I
want
the
line
to
move
upwards
","
so
that
it
is
still
mathematically
at
the
correct
position
","
when
the
origin
moves
.
(
the
final
result
of
the
efforts
can
be
found
here
)
