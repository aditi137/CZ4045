readlines
gives
you
each
line
include
the
newline
at
the
end
of
the
line
.
So
you're
doing
comparisons
like
""""
cat\n
""""
in
""""
cat
","
blue\n
""""
.
Since
there
isn't
a
newline
in
the
right
place
","
the
check
fails
.
Try
this
to
strip
the
newlines
off
the
end
of
each
line
:
EDIT
Perhaps
a
better
rewrite
is
to
use
zip
and
just
iterate
through
the
files
:
