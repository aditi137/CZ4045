I
would
like
to
crop
out
an
image
from
an
existing
image
.
I've
taken
an
image
and
applied
monochrome
on
it
with
threshold
98
%
using
imagemagick
(
is
this
doable
in
openCV
?
)
The
resulting
image
is
this
:
Now
from
this
Image
I
would
like
to
crop
out
another
image
so
that
the
final
image
looks
like
this
:
Question
How
can
I
do
this
in
OpenCV
?
Note
","
the
only
reason
I
want
to
crop
the
image
is
so
that
I
can
use
this
answer
to
get
the
part
of
the
text
.
If
there
is
no
need
to
crop
out
a
new
image
and
instead
just
concentrate
on
black
part
of
the
image
to
begin
with
","
that
would
be
great
.
