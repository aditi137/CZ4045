model
refers
to
the
same
object
throughout
each
iteration
of
the
list
comprehension
in
model_GridSearch
","
so
you're
just
assigning
a
C
value
3
times
to
the
same
object
.
You
can
do
a
few
different
things
to
fix
this
:
you
could
a
copy
of
the
object
using
the
copy
module
","
or
pass
in
the
class
into
the
models_GridSearch
function
instead
of
an
instance
","
and
instantiate
an
object
on
each
iteration
.
You
could
also
refactor
your
code
in
various
ways
to
fix
things
.
It
all
depends
on
your
goals
.
