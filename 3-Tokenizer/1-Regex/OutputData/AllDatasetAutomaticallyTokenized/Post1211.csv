Assuming
that
the
IP
192.168.40.28
is
correct
my
next
quess
would
be
that
you
don't
have
the
port
3050
open
(
thats
the
default
port
for
Firebird
)
.
Check
your
server's
firewall
and
open
the
port
.
You
can
use
some
other
port
instead
of
3050
by
seting
the
RemoteServicePort
parameter
in
the
firebird.conf
file
","
but
then
you
have
to
set
the
port
parameter
in
the
connect
method
too
.
