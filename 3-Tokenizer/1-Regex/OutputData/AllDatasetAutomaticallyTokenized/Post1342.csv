I'm
trying
to
write
a
program
that
will
give
me
a
nice
.
txt
file
displaying
this
year's
calendar
","
however
","
I
don't
want
to
use
the
calendar
function
","
but
datetime
.
I
want
it
to
have
the
following
format
(
I
want
to
have
the
first
3
letter
of
every
day
of
the
week
next
to
it
)
:
Tue
Jan
01
Wed
Jan
02
all
the
way
to
Tue
Dec
31
(
basically
365
lines
altogether
with
10
characters
in
every
line
","
and
every
line
ends
in
a
newline
""""
\
n
""""
)
.
This
is
what
I
have
gathered
going
from
various
stackflow
questions
","
tutorials
and
modules
.
So
far
no
success
.
My
main
issue
is
that
I
am
unfamiliar
with
how
I
get
python
to
give
me
a
range
of
dates
(
here
being
the
year
2013
","
but
it
could
also
be
just
any
increment
in
time
such
as
June
2011
to
December
2014
)
and
of
course
to
print
the
day
of
the
week
next
to
it
.
This
way
it
could
be
adapted
to
any
time
period
you
might
need
this
small
calendar
for
.
I
was
thinking
maybe
assigning
every
day's
number
(
1
being
Monday
","
2
being
Tuesday
is
the
pattern
if
I'm
correct
)
the
first
3
letters
of
a
day
in
the
week
so
it's
all
neat
and
of
the
same
length
.
