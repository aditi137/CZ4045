hop
is
right
","
and
dF
.
is
incorrect
on
why
the
error
occurs
.
Since
you
haven't
called
f.close()
yet
","
the
file
is
not
removed

The
doc
for
NamedTemporaryFile
says
:
Whether
the
name
can
be
used
to
open
the
file
a
second
time
","
while
the
named
temporary
file
is
still
open
","
varies
across
platforms
(
it
can
be
so
used
on
Unix
;
it
cannot
on
Windows
NT
or
later
)
.
And
for
TemporaryFile
:
Under
Unix
","
the
directory
entry
for
the
file
is
removed
immediately
after
the
file
is
created
.
Other
platforms
do
not
support
this

your
code
should
not
rely
on
a
temporary
file
created
using
this
function
having
or
not
having
a
visible
name

the
file
system

Therefore
","
to
persist

temporary

you

The
solution
Hans
Sjunnesson
provided
is
also
off
","
because
copyfileobj
only
copies
from
file-like
object
to
file-like
object
","
not
file
name
:
"shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])"
Copy
the
contents
of
the
file-like
object
fsrc
to
the
file-like
object
fdst
.
The
integer
length
","
if
given
","
is
the
buffer
size

In
particular
","
a
negative
length
value
means
to
copy
the
data
without
looping
over
the
source
data
in
chunks
;
by
default
the
data
is
read
in
chunks
to
avoid
uncontrolled
memory
consumption
.
Note
that
if
the
current
file
position
of
the
fsrc
object

not
0
","
only
the
contents
