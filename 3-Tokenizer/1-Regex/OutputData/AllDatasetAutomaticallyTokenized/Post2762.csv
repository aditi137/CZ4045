I
have
texts
like
I
want
to
remove
only
the
text
with
braces
and
angular
brackets
and
extract
in
between
data
.
I
tried
but
since
closing
braces
are
at
the
end
of
text
","
whole
text
is
getting
deleted
when
re.sub
is
used
.
How
to
take
the
only
data
in
between
multiple
braces
(
angular
or
flower
brackets
)
