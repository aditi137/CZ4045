I've
noticed
gnu-binutils-strings
can
printout
utf-16
content
in
a
file
-
is
it
possible
for
the
program
to
print
out
utf-8
strings
?
if
so
","
which
arguments
are
appropriate
?
i'm
working
in
a
python
environment
using
subprocess
and
would
like
to
work
with
the
output
from
gnu-binutils-strings
that
a
subprocess.Popen
call
would
generate
through
a
pipe
.
