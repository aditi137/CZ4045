If
you
read
through
your
log
carefully
you
might
spot
this
line
:
The
""""
fatal
error
""""
part
is
especially
important
.
:
)
This
means
that
the
ffi
headers
couldn't
be
located
by
your
compiler
.
I'm
not
sure
how
to
do
it
since
I'm
not
a
Mac
user
but
maybe
homebrew
could
help
you
","
or
Google
.
To
me
it
seems
like
you
should
install
homebrew
and
then
just
run
:
Then
try
pip
again
.
Edit
The
full
list
of
dependencies
are
:
python
libffi
libssl
libxml2
libxslt1
So
you'll
need
all
those
","
and
their
headers
","
if
you
want
to
continue
down
this
path
.
An
easier
solution
is
to
download
pre-built
binaries
for
your
Mac
","
from
mitmproxy.org
(
OSX
Mountain
Lion
and
later
)
.
I
found
this
info
in
the
installation
docs
.
