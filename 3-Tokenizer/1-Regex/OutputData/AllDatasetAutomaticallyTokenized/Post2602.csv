I
was
trying
to
get
the
title
of
the
websites
.
So
","
I
used
this
snippet
to
do
this
This
works
perfectly
and
gives
Google
as
the
title
and
flushes
the
output
to
test_data.txt
.
But
when
I
try
to
run
the
same
code
as
a
web
service
","
it
doesn't
work
.
I
get
an
empty
text
file
.
I
am
hitting
this
URL
to
run
this
web
service
on
my
local
http://0.0.0.0:8881/get_title
Another
thing
which
has
made
me
even
more
anxious
is
when
I
run
the
web
service
for
msn.com
","
it
works
well
for
both
snippets(even the web service)
.
Any
help
would
be
thankful
!
!
