Your
error
is
caused
because
you
provide
sum
with
an
integer
value
(
iatt
=
int(i)
)
when
you
should
be
providing
it
with
the
contents
of
the
list
which
is
split
on
'
","
'
.
You
have
a
couple
of
options
for
this
.
Either
provide
a
comprehension
to
sum
and
cast
every
element
to
an
int
inside
the
comprehension
:
or
","
use
a
built-in
like
map
which
pretty
much
does
the
same
thing
:
in
both
cases
","
sum
expects
something
that
can
be
iterated
through
and
it
handles
the
summing
.
Of
course
","
you
could
manually
loop
over
the
contents
of
att
","
adding
int(i)
to
total
as
you
go
:
