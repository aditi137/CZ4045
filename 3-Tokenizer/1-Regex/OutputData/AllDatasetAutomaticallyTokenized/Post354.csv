WX
has
issues
on
the
Mac
.
I
had
a
look
here
","
as
I
want
to
get
an
event
driven
GUI
API
to
do
some
stuff
in
Python
.
I
have
wx
installed
on
my
mac
as
part
of
MatPlotLib
","
but
it
does
not
work
properly
.
It
wont
take
in
put
from
the
keyboard
.
I
have
installed
this
three
times
on
three
different
Mac
operating
systems
","
and
though
it
worked
the
first
time
","
the
other
two
times
I
had
this
issue
.
This
version
I
am
using
with
Enthought's
distribution
","
so
no
installation
was
necessary
.
When
I
have
installed
it
separately
","
there
were
so
many
dependent
installations
","
that
it
was
a
trial
to
install
.
From
what
I
have
read
here
","
I
will
give
Tkinter
a
go
","
as
this
needs
to
be
simple
and
cross
platform
","
but
I
thought
I
would
just
share
the
above
with
you
.
I
like
the
Mac
OS
for
a
number
of
different
reasons
","
but
python
tools
install
far
easier
on
Windows
(
and
probably
other
Linux
)
.
I
just
thought
I
would
give
a
Mac
perspective
here
.
