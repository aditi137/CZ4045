I
think
spider
arguments
would
be
the
solution
in
your
case
.
When
invoking
scrapy
like
scrapy
crawl
some_spider
","
you
could
add
arguments
like
scrapy
crawl
some_spider
-
a
foo=bar
","
and
the
spider
would
receive
the
values
via
its
constructor
","
e.g
.
:
What's
more
","
as
scrapy.Spider
actually
sets
all
additional
arguments
as
instance
attributes
","
you
don't
even
need
to
explicitly
override
the
__init__
method
but
just
access
the
.
foo
attribute
.
