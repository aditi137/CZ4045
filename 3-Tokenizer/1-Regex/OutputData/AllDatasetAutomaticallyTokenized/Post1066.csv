I've
a
problem
:
I
created
a
small
Python
script
to
read
data
from
an
Omron
PLC
memory
on
LAN
.
Delphi
program
run
batch
file
that
run
Python
script
periodically
(
every
6
seconds
)
.
This
script
runs
on
2
Win
7
PCs
and
1
Win
XP
PC
.
My
problem
is
:
no
data
transfer
between
Win
XP
PC
and
PLC
for
a
random
period
of
time
(
around
1
minute
","
sometimes
more
)
","
but
Win
7
PCs
have
no
problem
to
communicate
with
same
PLC
.
I
use
UDP
protocol
.
LAN
seems
""""
fall
to
sleep
""""
.
This
is
LOG
File
:
(
08:41:13
->
08:42:30
.
Expectation
08:41:13
->
08:41:19
","
08:41:25
","
08:41:31
","
...
)
What
could
be
the
problem
?
