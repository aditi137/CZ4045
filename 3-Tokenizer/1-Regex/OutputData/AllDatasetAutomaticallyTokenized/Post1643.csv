As
per
my
understanding
of
your
question
","
your
application
is
not
closing
when
you
click
on
the
close
button
(
The
red
button
with
X
on
the
right
top
corner
.
)
By
default
when
you
click
the
close
button
your
application
should
close
.
In
your
case
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
bind
the
EVT_CLOSE
to
some
method
","
which
has
no
code
in
it
to
close
the
app
window
.
For
eg
.
consider
the
code
snippet
below
","
I
have
intentionally
bind
the
EVT_CLOSE
event
to
a
method
named
as
closeWindow()
.
This
method
does
nothing
that
is
why
I
have
the
pass
keyword
there
.
Now
if
you
execute
the
code
snippet
below
you
can
see
that
the
app
window
won't
close
.
Code
:
So
","
in
order
to
close
the
app
window
you
need
to
change
the
closeWindow()
.
For
eg
:
Following
code
snippet
will
use
the
Destroy()
close
the
app
window
when
you
click
on
the
close
button
.
I
hope
it
was
useful
.
