I
used
pychart
and
thought
it
was
very
straightforward
.
http://home.gna.org/pychart/
It's
all
native
python
and
does
not
have
a
busload
of
dependencies
.
I'm
sure
matplotlib
is
lovely
but
I'd
be
downloading
and
installing
for
days
and
I
just
want
one
measley
bar
chart
!
It
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
updated
in
a
few
years
but
hey
it
works
!
