Ok
","
Thanks
to
Using
Pymunk
with
Pyinstaller
.
It
took
me
a
long
time
but
I
now
understand
how
to
throw
anything
I
want
into
an
exe
with
Pyinstaller
.
However
","
a
particular
dll-that
is
there-still
fails
to
load-chipmunk.dll
.
Heres
my
.
spec
file
for
Pyinstaller
.
This
all
packages
no
problem
.
The
image
loads
fine
as
long
as
I
have
the
dll
next
to
the
exe
so
I
dont
error
.
I
confirmed
the
dll
was
in
by
comparing
before
and
after
versions
of
including
the
dll
.
160
kb
difference
.
Then
I
used
this
to
check
if
the
dll
was
in
the
current
path
when
launched
under
Pyinstallers
exe
environment
.
I
get
an
exact
1
dlls
on
output
but
pymunk
complains
it
couldn't
find
it
.
Its
in
the
_MEIPASS
PATH
dir
so
how
come
pymunk
can't
find
it
?
The
dll
is
in
the
root
so
no
searching
should
be
required
.
How
can
I
get
pymunk
to
search
the
right
location
?
