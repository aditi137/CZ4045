You
have
have
a
python
script
that
requires
some
celery
tasks
and
you
need
Django
ORM
too
for
the
database
interactions
.
You
can
setup
the
django
project
create
an
app
for
your
purpose
","
include
in
settings.py
and
inside
your
app
in
models.py
create
the
required
models
.

What
minimal
files
i
need
to
use
django
ORM
Set
up
the
environment
for
executing
celery
.
Ie
","
redis
server
.
integrate
""""
djcelery
""""
with
django
project
.
for
the
celery
task
purpose
.
you
can
use
celery
beats
for
the
periodic
tasks
.
or
delay
.
ref
:
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/django/first-steps-with-django.html
You
can
import and
use
the
django
models
like
normal
inside
the
celery
tasks
.
And
The
celery
tasks
you
can
run
using
i
.
celery
-
A
tasks
worker
-
-
loglevel=info
ii
.
celery
-
A
tasks
beat
-
l
info
.
use
beats
if
you
want
the
tasks
which
are
written
for
periodic
execution
.
If
the
tasks
need
to
be
executed
asynchronously
just
immediately
or
after
a
time
interval
","
you
can
use
task_name.delay()
call
the
tasks
inside
the
python
script
using
delay()
i
think
to
use
djcelery
in
your
script
you
may
need
to
set
up
the
django
env
inside
the
script
.
just
Do
django.setup()
.
i
think
this
will
help
you
to
solve
your
problem
.
