Python
favours
explicit
over
implicit
.
Your
options
are
to
explicitly
use
the
bisect
module
if
you
know
your
data
is
sorted
","
or
create
a
subclass
of
list
that
implements
__contains__
by
using
that
module
.
For
example
:
could
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
list
","
and
in
will
use
__contains__
automatically
.
You'd
probably
want
to
override
__setitem__
","
.
extend()
and
.
append()
to
maintain
the
list
in
sorted
order
","
too
.
