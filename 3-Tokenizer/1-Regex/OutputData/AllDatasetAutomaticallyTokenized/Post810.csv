Assuming
all
the
scripts
are
python
the
easiest
solution
would
be
to
write
functions
that
imports(and thus runs)
the
other
scripts
.
point
to
these
functions
with
either
the
multiprocessing
or
threading
module
.
Now
that
you
have
each
script
running
in
its
own
process
or
thread
","
you
can
use
condition
objects
and
the
.
wait()
.
notify()
methods
to
have
them
stop
and
wait
on
each
other
.
All
the
documentation
to
implement
such
a
thing
can
be
found
here
.
