This
is
a
bit
hacky
","
but
it
could
work
.
Why
not
call
multiple
.
py
scripts
in
a
row
?
Each
scripts
can
pass
in
a
small
subset
of
the
parameters
","
and
the
values
to
a
temp
text
file
.
The
final
script
will
read
and
work
off
of
the
temp
text
file
.
I
agree
that
this
method
is
filled
with
danger
and
WTF's
","
but
sometimes
you
have
to
just
hack
stuff
together
.
