You
implemented
a
naive
matrix
multiplication
algorithm
","
which
scipy.weave
compiles
to
fast
machine
code
.
However
","
there
are
non-obvious
","
more
CPU
cache
efficient
algorithms
for
matrix
multiplication
(
which
usually
split
the
matrix
into
blocks
and
deal
with
those
)
","
and
additional
speed
can
be
gained
with
CPU-specific
optimizations
.
Numpy
by
default
uses
an
optimized
BLAS
library
for
this
operation
","
if
you
have
one
installed
.
These
libraries
will
likely
be
fast
compared
to
anything
you
can
code
up
yourself
without
doing
an
amount
of
research
