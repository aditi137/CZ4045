(
I
wrote
this
before
I
saw
matzeri's
response
.
I
still
may
try
extending
python
to
run
code
from
the
C
library
","
but
getting
the
C
code
I've
already
written
to
work
would
be
vastly
preferable
.

I
have
no
idea
what's
going
on
with
Cygwin's
gdb
","
but
after
getting
over
my
frustration
I
answered
my
alternative
question
.
Turns
out
you
can
indeed
call
a
C
function
from
python
.
Extending
Python
with
C
or
C
+
+
I'll
try
it
tomorrow
and
I
see
caveats
","
but
if
python.org
has
a
section
on
it
","
I'm
betting
it
can
be
done
.
