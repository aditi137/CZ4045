My
database
consists
of
collection
of
a
large
no
.
of
hotels
(
approx
121
","
000
)
.
This
is
how
my
collection
looks
like
:
Each
document
can
have
1
or
more
phone
numbers
separated
by
""""
|
""""
delimiter
.
I
have
to
group
together
documents
having
same
phone
number
.
By
real
time
","
I
mean
when
a
user
opens
up
a
particular
hotel
to
see
its
details
on
the
web
interface
","
I
should
be
able
to
display
all
the
hotels
linked
to
it
grouped
by
common
phone
numbers
.
While
grouping
","
if
one
hotel
links
to
another
and
that
hotels
links
to
another
","
then
all
3
should
be
grouped
together
.
Example
:
Hotel
A
has
phone
numbers
1|2
","
B
has
phone
numbers
3|4
and
C
has
phone
numbers
2|3
","
then
A
","
B
and
C
should
be
grouped
together
.
This
is
one
code
I
wrote
in
Python
.
In
this
one
","
I
tried
performing
linear
search
in
a
for
loop
.
I
am
getting
some
errors
as
of
now
but
it
should
work
when
rectified
.
I
need
an
optimized
version
of
this
as
liner
search
has
poor
time
complexity
.
I
am
pretty
new
to
this
so
any
other
suggestions
to
improve
the
code
are
welcome
.
Thanks
.
