The
error
you
are
seeing
can
only
be
explained
if
csv.writer
is
a
string
.
This
recreates
your
error
:
I'm
guessing
you
are
either
working
in
an
environment
like
Spyder
which
by
default
keeps
a
single
session
alive
for
code
to
run
in
","
or
you
are
experimenting
in
a
REPL
like
IPython
or
a
Jupyter
notebook
.
At
some
point
you
mistakenly
assigned
a
new
value
to
csv.writer
.
The
problem
will
go
away
if
you
reset
your
environment
","
since
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
your
code
.
To
reset
","
for
IPython
or
Spyder
just
exit
and
start
again
.
For
Jupyter
notebook
select
""""
Kernel|Restart
""""
from
the
menu
.
