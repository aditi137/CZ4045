The
better
way
of
doing
this
now
is
to
use
pip
install
with
the
-
e
option
.
It
uses
a
directory
with
the
setup.py
file
.
The
""""
.
""""
indicates
this
directory
.
This
works
the
same
way
as
the
setuptools
develop
method
.
I
believe
that
the
develop
creates
an
egg
link
in
your
sight
packages
folder
which
points
to
the
folder
of
the
library
.
http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#develop-deploy-the-project-source-in-development-mode
I
believe
this
is
why
you
get
the
absolute
path
.
There
may
be
a
conflict
with
a
develop
link
and
an
install
.
Things
could
have
also
been
moved
.
For
double
clicking
just
have
something
that
checks
sys.argv
.
If
there
is
no
value
for
sys.argv
[1]
append
build
","
install
","
or
develop
.
In
addition
","
I've
always
heard
that
you
want
to
import the
modules
then
call
the
functions
from
the
modules
.
from
package
import lib
.
lib.foo()
that
way
you
know
where
the
method
came
from
.
I
believe
the
import does
the
same
thing
for
both
ways
;
this
may
clean
up
your
import
.
Python
pathing
and
packaging
can
be
a
pain
.
