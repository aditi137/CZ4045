First
of
all
","
I
saw
many
threads
regarding
to
""""
maximum
recursion
depth
exceeded
""""
couldn't
find
in
any
of
them
a
solution
for
my
issue
.
I'm
learning
Python
these
days
and
trying
to
understand
the
following
issue
:
assume
we
have
two
classes
:
and
a
child
class
:
While
instantiating
MongoDbReporter
instance
the
following
exception
is
raised
:
Probably
I
created
some
recursion
here
but
I
can't
find
it
","
What
am
I
doing
wrong
?
