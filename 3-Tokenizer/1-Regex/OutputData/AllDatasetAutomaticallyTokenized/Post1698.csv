Don't
use
globals
.
This
should
technically
work
","
but
it's
bad
practice
and
in
this
case
there's
no
downside
to
simply
adding
a
variable
to
your
class
.
NotNone
has
this
very
moment
posted
an
example
of
how
to
do
so
with
a
kivy
property
","
which
adds
some
other
behaviour
you
may
find
convenient
later
.

Your
move
function
isn't
compatible
with
an
eventloop
driven
gui
like
kivy
(
or
many
other
gui
libraries
)
.
The
problem
is
that
the
while
function
is
a
blocking
call
-
all
of
kivy's
normal
tasks
can't
be
performed
until
the
move
function
terminates
.
Detecting
and
propagating
touch
is
one
of
these
things
","
so
on_touch_up
will
never
be
called
","
and
the
touched_down
variable
will
never
become
False
.
You
probably
instead
want
to
do
something
like
:
Using
the
clock
like
this
inserts
the
movement
into
the
normal
kivy
eventloop
","
so
it's
called
every
frame
without
blocking
everything
else
.
It
might
also
be
more
natural
to
have
an
update
function
that
is
always
scheduled
(
and
does
other
things
too
)
","
and
use
a
self.touched_down
attribute
as
above
to
optionally
perform
movement
during
that
function
.
