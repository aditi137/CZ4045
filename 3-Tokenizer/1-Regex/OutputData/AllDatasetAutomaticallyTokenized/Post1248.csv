I
am
trying
to
learn
pygtk
and
I
am
developing
a
GUI
for
axel
.
My
problem
is
I
need
to
show
progress
of
download
in
my
main
window
.
I
used
two
threads
one
for
downloading
and
second
for
progress
calculation
.
Download
is
done
by
axel
but
my
second
thread
is
not
running
until
first
thread
stops
.
and
second
thread
is
not
updating
the
gui
I
used
gobject.idel_add
it
stucks
the
main
window
upon
download
start
tried
to
use
Gtk.gdk.thread_init()
/
thread_enter()
/
thread_leave()
it
says
no
module
gdk
in
Gtk
.
On
top
of
the
page
Gtk
is
imported
from
gi.repository
By
the
way
I
am
using
quickly
to
develop
the
app
Is
there
any
way
to
solve
the
problem
.
or
any
similiar
examples
.
