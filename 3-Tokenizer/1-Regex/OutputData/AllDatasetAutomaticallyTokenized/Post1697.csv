I'm
quite
new
to
Kivy
&
Python
so
please
excuse
the
poor
code
/
explanation
!
When
the
touch
down
event
is
activated
I
want
a
section
of
code
to
continuously
run
until
the
touch
up
event
is
activated
.
My
current
method
is
using
a
global
variable
which
is
manipulated
by
both
events
.
But
the
loop
doesn't
seem
to
register
the
change
in
the
global
variable
.
Is
there
anyway
to
make
this
method
work
.
Or
alternatively
another
method
which
would
be
more
suitable
?
Thanks
!
