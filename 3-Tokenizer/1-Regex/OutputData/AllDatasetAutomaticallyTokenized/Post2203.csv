I
want
to
serve
some
Polymer-code
via
Django
in
a
Google
App
Engine
.
The
problem
is
","
that
Polymer
uses
double
curly
braces
","
as
does
Django
.
In
newer
Django
versions
","
one
can
use
the
verbatim-tag
","
but
in
the
version
used
in
Google
App
Engine
","
this
tag
is
not
implemented
.
Is
there
an
alternative
?
