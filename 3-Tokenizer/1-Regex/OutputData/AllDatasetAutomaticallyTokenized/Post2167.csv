With
Tkinter
","
such
things
are
commonly
done
using
the
universal
widget
after()
method
.
You
should
generally
not
use
time.sleep()
in
a
Tkinter
program
because
it
prevents
the
mainloop()
from
running
(
which
is
what
is
making
the
GUI
unresponsive
in
your
code
)
.
A
successful
after()
call
will
return
an
integer
""""
cancel
id
""""
which
can
used
to
stop
the
callback
just
scheduled
.
This
is
what's
needed
by
the
Stop()
method
of
your
Example
class
to
stop
the
method
doing
the
counting
.
