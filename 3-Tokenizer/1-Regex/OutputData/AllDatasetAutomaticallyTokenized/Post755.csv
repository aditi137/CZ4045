Two
different
ideas
for
performance
constraints
:
The
bottleneck
is
the
workers
fighting
each
other
and
the
parent
for
access
to
the
job
queue
.
The
bottleneck
is
connection
rate-limits
(
syn-flood
protection
)
on
the
servers
.
Gathering
more
information
:
Profile
the
amount
of
work
done
:
tasks
completed
per
second
","
use
this
as
your
core
performance
metric
.
Use
packet
capture
to
view
the
network
activity
for
network-level
delays
.
Have
your
workers
document
how
long
they
wait
for
access
to
the
job
queue
.
Possible
improvements
:
Have
your
workers
use
persistent
connections
if
available
/
applicable
(
e.g
.
HTTP
)
.
Split
the
tasks
into
multiple
job
queues
fed
to
pools
of
workers
.
