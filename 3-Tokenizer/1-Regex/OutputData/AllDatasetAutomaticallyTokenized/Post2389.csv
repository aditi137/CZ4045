Virtualenvs
are
notorious
.
They
tinker
around
with
paths
lots
of
times
and
mess
up
quite
a
lot
of
things
.
You
need
to
check
the
PATH
variable
inside
b.py
in
both
scenarios
.
This
will
most
probably
not
be
the
same
.
You'd
need
to
set
the
path
to
include
your
c.py's
directory
.
You
can
check
the
PATH
in
main.py
and
if
it
is
correct
there
","
it
would
mean
that
one
of
your
other
imports
is
changing
your
sys.path
ina
way
to
remove
that
.
