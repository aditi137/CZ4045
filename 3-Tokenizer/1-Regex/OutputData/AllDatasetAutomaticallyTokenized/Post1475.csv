Suppose
I
have
a
Python
program
that
runs
slow
-
after
profiliing
and
I
have
identified
the
bottleneck
.
One
particular
function
from
a
3rd
party
module
I
imported
is
particularly
slow
.
For
this
particular
case
","
I
know
that
function
is
implemented
in
Python
(
Used
Eclipse
and
it's
easy
to
jump
to
the
function
definition
)
.
So
I
know
that
I
can
convert
that
function
into
Cython
as
a
speed-up
option
.
(
If
it
is
already
implemented
in
C
","
there
is
no
point
in
writing
it
in
Cython
...
)
.
If
I
don't
have
an
IDE
","
what
would
be
an
easy
option
to
determine
this
?
I
know
that
I
can
go
to
the
directory
where
the
module
is
installed
and
infer
that
it
is
in
C
if
the
module
is
in
.
so
.
But
is
there
any
alternative
?
Thanks
