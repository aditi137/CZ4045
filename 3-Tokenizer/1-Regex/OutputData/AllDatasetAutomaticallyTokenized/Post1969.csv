I
have
some
class
instances
that
I
pickle
using
__reduce__
.
These
classes
have
members
that
I
collect
in
another
array
.
I
need
to
pickle
this
array
","
but
I
can't
find
the
right
way
to
do
it
.
Just
to
clarify
things
","
imagine
I
have
classes
that
represent
square
","
rectangle
and
circle
.
I
create
some
instances
:
I
can
pickle
the
list
but
I
need
a
way
to
pickle
this
array
of
the
class
instances
properties
keeping
the
reference
to
the
original
objects
so
that
if
one
object
changes
the
relative
property
changes
:
imagine
I
call
C.grow(2)
I
expect
to
have
dimensions
[2]
=
12
.
To
solve
the
problem
I
now
pickle
this
dictionary
:
but
I
think
this
is
a
very
poor
solution
.
I
appreciate
any
suggestion
.
