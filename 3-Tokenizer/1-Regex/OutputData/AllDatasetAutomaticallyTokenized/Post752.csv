I
have
a
python
(
2.6.5
64-bit
","
Windows
2008
Server
R2
)
app
that
launches
worker
processes
.
The
parent
process
puts
jobs
in
a
job
queue
","
from
which
workers
pick
them
up
.
Similarly
it
has
a
results
queue
.
Each
worker
performs
its
job
by
querying
a
server
.
CPU
usage
by
the
workers
is
low
.
When
the
number
of
workers
grows
","
CPU
usage
on
the
servers
actually
shrinks
.
The
servers
themselves
are
not
the
bottleneck
","
as
I
can
load
them
up
further
from
other
applications
.
Anyone
else
seen
similar
behavior
?
Is
there
an
issue
with
python
multiprocessing
queues
when
a
large
number
of
processes
are
reading
or
writing
to
the
same
queues
?
