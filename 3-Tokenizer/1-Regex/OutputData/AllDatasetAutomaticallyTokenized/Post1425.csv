I've
tried
to
implement
WebSocket
frame
unmasking
algorithm
(
based
on
this
:
How
can
I
send
and
receive
WebSocket
messages
on
the
server
side
?
)
on
the
server
side
.
Here's
what
I've
got
:
However
I
get
very
strange
results
.
On
JavaScript
side
:
produces
on
the
server
side
:
More
calls
to
"w.send(""test"")"
;
produces
"[2, 97, 0, 0]"
.
Also
first
two
arrays
have
length
>
4
(
number
of
characters
in
word
test
)
.
And
none
of
these
gets
converted
to
word
test
.
It
seeems
that
I
must
be
doing
something
wrong
in
my
decoding
code
.
What's
causing
that
?
Any
help
?
EDIT
Have
look
at
raw
frames
:
Of
course
these
numbers
are
a
bit
random
(
due
to
masking
)
","
but
note
that
second
byte
(
which
is
supposed
to
represent
the
length
of
payload
)
is
134
","
then
133
and
then
always
132
.
Also
first
two
frames
are
longer
then
other
frames
.
What's
going
on
here
?
