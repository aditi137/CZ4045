I
want
to
parse
the
YAML
file
having
the
following
data
structure
:
I
have
the
following
code
but
I'm
having
a
""""
TypeError
:
list
indices
must
be
integers
","
not
str
""""
in
the
line
20
:
(
I'm
calling
this
method
later
with
iStream
set
to
sys.stdin
to
read
the
data
file
)
.
I
think
I'm
missing
something
basic
here
regarding
the
data
structure
or
the
way
the
yaml.load_all
is
working
.
What
am
I
missing
?
