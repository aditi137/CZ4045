Reading
small
files
isn't
slow
","
provided
you
do
it
in
one
go
.
First
","
let's
create
a
80
byte
test
file
;
Then
we
define
a
function
to
read
all
of
it
;
Then
","
a
timing
run
(
reading
from
a
normal
harddisk
","
not
an
SSD
)
:
So
it
takes
18
μs
to
read
such
a
file
.
I
wouldn't
call
that
slow
.
When
I
create
9
of
these
test
files
and
read
them
in
a
loop
:
With
the
loop
overhead
it
is
still
only
about
21
μs
per
file
.
Edit
:
Having
seen
your
code
","
it
seems
pretty
complicated
for
what
it
does
.
I
would
structure
it
like
this
:
Advantages
:
This
reads
every
sensor
file
in
one
go
.
It
also
removes
two
function
calls
per
sensor
.
Much
less
typing
.
