This
is
not
impossible
to
render
in
Bokeh
(
as
of
0.4.4
)
but
there
is
no
built-in
support
to
help
with
graphs
and
graph
layout
yet
.
You
would
have
to
compute
or
use
a
library
to
compute
the
line
points
for
the
edges
","
etc.
and
then
pass
those
to
Bokeh
.
Graph
support
is
on
our
roadmap
but
it
will
probably
not
be
until
later
this
year
unless
a
complete
PR
gets
dropped
in
our
lap
.
