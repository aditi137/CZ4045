The
xlwt
module
doesn't
support
the
xlsx
format
.
The
xlsx
file
format
is
completely
different
from
the
xls
format
supported
by
xlwt
.
As
an
alternative
have
a
look
at
XlsxWriter
which
is
a
Python
module
for
creating
xlsx
files
.
It
supports
a
lot
of
Excel
features
.
Have
a
look
at
the
documentation
or
start
with
the
examples
.
