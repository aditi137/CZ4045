Just
a
style
question
:
Is
there
a
build-in
method
to
get
the
combinations
under
the
assertion
of
commutative
property
and
excluding
elements
paired
with
itself
?
Doesn't
seem
very
Python
.
I
know
of
itertools.product
which
is
the
Cartesian
product
.
I
could
convert
it
to
a
set
which
would
exclude
the
identity-pairings
but
it's
still
the
non-commutative
product
.
