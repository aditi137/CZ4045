This
question
has
been
answered
but
I
wanted
to
address
the
comment
that
using
list
comprehension
is
much
slower
than
using
.
remove()
.
Some
profiles
from
my
machine
(
using
Python
2.7.6
)
.
If
you
use
the
fastest
way
to
copy
a
list
(
which
isn't
very
readable
)
","
you
will
be
about
36
%
faster
than
using
list
comprehension
.
But
if
you
copy
the
list
by
using
the
list()
class
(
which
is
much
more
common
and
Pythonic
)
","
then
you're
going
to
be
26
%
slower
than
using
list
comprehension
.
Really
","
it's
all
pretty
fast
.
I
think
the
argument
could
be
made
that
.
remove()
is
more
readable
than
list
a
list
comprehension
technique
","
but
it's
not
necessarily
faster
unless
you're
interested
in
giving
up
readability
in
the
duplication
.
The
big
advantage
of
list
comprehension
in
this
scenario
is
that
it's
much
more
succinct
(
i.e.
if
you
had
a
function
that
was
to
remove
an
element
from
a
given
list
for
some
reason
","
it
could
be
done
in
1
line
","
whilst
the
other
method
would
require
3
lines
.
)
There
are
times
in
which
one-liners
can
be
very
handy
(
although
they
typically
come
at
the
cost
of
some
readability
)
.
Additionally
","
using
list
comprehension
excels
in
the
case
when
you
don't
actually
know
if
the
element
to
be
removed
is
actually
in
the
list
to
begin
with
.
While
.
remove()
will
throw
a
ValueError
","
list
comprehension
will
operate
as
expected
.
