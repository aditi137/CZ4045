Yes
","
it's
possible
:
All
you
need
to
do
is
using
the
most
proper
geometry
manager
(
pack
in
this
case
)
for
the
label
widget
that
is
intended
to
show
a
status
(
ststlabel
)
;
then
adding
some
options
to
the
geometry
manager
:
fill
makes
it
extended
as
you
stretch
the
window
horizontally
;
and
side
puts
it
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
screen
which
means
it
will
always
stay
there
(
until
you
make
the
geometry
of
any
of
preceding
widgets
to
bottom
.
Otherwise
","
it'll
be
replaced
with
that
)
.
Now
we
got
it
!
But
there
is
a
problem
that
it
doesn't
show
the
beginning
of
the
status
text
.
To
solve
this
add
an
anchor
option
to
the
status
label
and
change
its
value
to
W
since
we
want
to
see
the
beginning
(
the
most
left
side
)
of
the
text
.
And
W
which
stands
for
""""
West
""""
","
does
it
.
