","
the
paginator
contains
a
bug
that
doesn't
tally
with
the
documentation
(
or
vice
versa
)
.
MaxItems
doesn't
return
the
Marker
or
NextToken
when
total
items
exceed
MaxItems
number
.
Indeed
PageSize
is
the
one
that
controlling
return
of
Marker
/
NextToken
indictator
.
It
is
not
your
mistake
that
your
code
doesn't
works
.
MaxItems
in
the
paginator
seems
become
a
""""
threshold
""""
indicator
.
Ironically
","
the
MaxItems
inside
original
boto3.iam.list_users
still
works
as
mentioned
.
If
you
check
boto3.iam.list_users
","
you
will
notice
either
you
omit
Marker
","
otherwise
you
must
put
a
value
.
Apparently
","
paginator
is
NOT
a
wrapper
for
all
boto3
class
list_
*
method
.
You
can
follow
up
the
issue
I
filed
in
boto3
github
.
According
to
the
member
","
you
can
call
build_full_result
after
paginate()
","
that
will
show
the
desire
behavior
.
