Besides
@Matt's
approach
","
one
way
to
change
the
default
directory
to
use
for
notebooks
permanently
is
to
change
the
config
files
.
Firstly
in
the
cmdline
","
type
:
to
initialize
a
profile
with
the
default
configuration
file
.
Secondly
","
in
file
ipython_notebook_config.py
","
uncomment
and
edit
this
line
:
changing
D:\\Documents\\Desktop
to
whatever
path
you
like
.
This
works
for
me
;
)
UPDATE
:
There
is
no
c.NotebookManager.notebook_dir
anymore
.
Now
","
the
line
to
uncomment
and
config
is
this
one
:
c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir
=
'
Z:\\username_example\folder_that_you_whant
'
