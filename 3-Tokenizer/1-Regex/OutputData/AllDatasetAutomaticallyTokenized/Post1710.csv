If
you
want
to
use
the
id
for
a
single
request
then
passing
around
the
local
variable
as
you
seem
to
be
doing
is
better
than
using
globals
.
If
you
want
to
preserve
the
id
across
requests
you
can
save
the
value
in
cookies(if safety of id is not a concern)
and
access
it
then
easily
.
The
cookie's
are
saved
on
the
user's
computer
and
are
accessible
only
during
the
request
.
For
more
on
using
cookies
in
bottle
refer
bottle's
documentation(it is explained in the tutorial)
.
Also
:
instead
of
embedding
the
html
in
your
code
use
templates
!
It
will
make
your
code
neater
.
