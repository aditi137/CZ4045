I'm
an
ubuntu
user
.
As
you
know
","
python
promt
is
a
very
useful
tool
.
And
I
want
to
replace
my
calculator
app
with
it
.
What
I
want
is
a
new
terminal
with
python
shell
running
on
it
to
show
up
when
I
press
a
key
combination
.
I
can
assign
scripts
to
shortcut
keys
with
compiz-config
settings
manager
","
but
I
can't
get
the
result
I
want
.
'
gnome-terminal;python3
;
'
launches
a
new
terminal
without
python
running
on
it
.
Looks
like
it
starts
python
in
background
on
tty7
.
So
how
can
I
get
the
result
I
want
.
