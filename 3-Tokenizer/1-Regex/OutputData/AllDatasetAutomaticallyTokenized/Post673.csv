You
can
quite
easily
listen
to
your
UDP
port
with
the
standard
socket
module
.
Examples
are
available
.
As
a
first
step
","
your
data
could
go
in
a
simple
Python
list
","
as
lists
are
optimized
for
appending
data
.
Removing
the
first
elements
takes
much
more
time
","
so
you
might
want
to
only
do
this
from
time
to
time
","
and
only
plot
","
in
the
mean
time
","
the
last
1024
(
or
whatever
)
elements
of
the
list
.
Plotting
can
then
conveniently
be
done
with
the
famous
Matplotlib
plotting
library
:
matplotlib.pyplot.plot(data_list)
.
Since
you
want
real
time
","
you
might
find
the
animation
examples
useful
.
If
you
need
to
optimize
the
data
acquisition
speed
","
you
can
have
the
(
also
famous
)
NumPy
array-manipulation
library
directly
interpret
the
data
from
the
stream
as
an
array
of
numbers
(
Matplotlib
can
plot
such
arrays
)
","
with
the
numpy.frombuffer()
function
.
