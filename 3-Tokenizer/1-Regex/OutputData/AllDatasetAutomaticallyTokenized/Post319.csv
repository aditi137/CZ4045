The
web
service
is
the
best
way
","
but
there
are
some
caveats
:
You
should
always
ask
the
user
if
it
is
ok
to
send
error
feedback
information
.
You
should
be
prepared
to
fail
gracefully
if
there
are
network
errors
.
Don't
let
a
failure
to
report
a
crash
impede
recovery
!
You
should
avoid
including
user
identifying
or
sensitive
information
unless
the
user
knows
(
see
#
1
)
and
you
should
either
use
SSL
or
otherwise
protect
it
.
Some
jurisdictions
impose
burdens
on
you
that
you
might
not
want
to
deal
with
","
so
it's
best
to
simply
not
save
such
information
.
Like
any
web
service
","
make
sure
your
service
is
not
exploitable
by
miscreants
.
