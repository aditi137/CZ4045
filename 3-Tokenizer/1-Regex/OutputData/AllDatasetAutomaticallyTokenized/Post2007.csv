I
have
a
file
at
/
location
/
data.txt
.
In
this
file
I
have
entry
like
:
aaa:xxx:abc.com:1857:xxx1:rel5t2:y
ifa:yyy:xyz.com:1858:yyy1:rel5t2:y
I
want
to
access
'
aaa
'
from
my
code
either
I
mention
aaa
while
giving
the
input
in
caps
or
small
after
running
my
python
code
it
should
return
me
aaa
is
the
right
item
But
here
I
want
to
include
one
exception
that
if
I
give
the
input
with
-
mc
suffix
(
aaa-mc
)
either
in
small
latters
or
in
caps
it
should
ignore
the
-
mc
.
Below
is
the
my
code
and
output
as
well
which
I
am
getting
now
.
def pITEMName():
When

gives
me
the
result
