Here's
how
I
would
solve
it
:
Read
the
csv-file
.
This
can
be
done
using
the
csv
module
for
python
Read
and
/
or
convert
the
date
stamps
according
to
your
bin
size
","
and
iterate
through
each
line
","
adding
to
the
correct
hour
bin
.
I
just
do
it
the
dirty
way
and
cut
the
minutes
and
seconds
:
row
[0]
[
:
-
5
]
returns
15
/
07
/
2015
11
","
a
date
and
hour
to
work
with
.
You'll
end
up
with
a
list
status_records
which
consists
of
two
dicts
","
representing
the
two
status
options
","
which
then
contain
the
hour
bins
:
""""
1
""""
:
{
""""
15
/
07
/
2015
11
""""
:
3
","
...
}
""""
-
11
""""
:
{
""""
15
/
07
/
2015
11
""""
:
0
","
...
}
Here's
a
sample
data.csv
with
some
more
data
(
so
that
you
can
actually
see
something
","
which
is
difficult
with
just
your
2
entries
-
I'm
using
the
same
date
format
and
the
status
codes
you
mentioned
)
:
And
here's
my
code
(
you'll
have
to
change
row
[0]
etc.
to
the
according
rows
to
work
with
your
csv
)
:
Output
:
Improvements
:
You
may
want
to
add
some
useful
labels
","
and
decide
wether
to
show
time
in
which
nothing
happens
(
which
will
maybe
clutter
the
chart
with
gaps
)
.
Also
","
be
aware
that
as-is
the
dates
should
be
sorted
in
the
csv
","
else
you
have
to
sort
them
yourself
in
the
code
.
Anyway
","
this
should
give
you
something
to
start
with
.
