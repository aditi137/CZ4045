I'd
like
to
""""
install
""""
a
version
of
Python
locally
","
which
doesn't
touch
anything
on
the
system
(
Windows
in
this
case
)
except
the
directory
I
extract
it
into
.
I
would
run
it
by
specifying
that
particular
python.exe
.
This
is
for
the
end-user
.
Essentially
","
I
want
to
be
able
to
extract
a
Python
into
a
directory
and
start
using
it
immediately
","
without
requiring
the
user
to
even
know
that
my
program
is
using
Python
.
I'm
looking
into
py2exe
and
PyInstaller
as
well
","
but
I'd
like
to
know
if
this
option
is
viable
.
