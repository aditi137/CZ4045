config.ini
.
py
This
works
fine
when
I
tested
it
locally
","
but
I
pushed
it
to
Heroku
and
got
a
ConfigParser.NoSectionError
when
I
check
the
Heroku
logs
.
Both
my
.
py
file
and
config.ini
file
are
in
the
same
directory
.
Googling
this
issue
shows
that
it
might
be
fixable
my
explicitly
stating
the
file
path
;
how
do
I
do
this
when
app
is
on
Heroku
?
Are
there
any
other
fixes
I
can
try
?
