You
can
make
your
own
ignore
function
:
Or
","
if
you
want
to
be
able
to
call
copytree
with
a
relative
path
:
From
the
docs
:
If
ignore
is
given
","
it
must
be
a
callable
that
will
receive
as
its
arguments
the
directory
being
visited
by
copytree()
","
and
a
list
of
its
contents
","
as
returned
by
os.listdir()
.
Since
copytree()
is
called
recursively
","
the
ignore
callable
will
be
called
once
for
each
directory
that
is
copied
.
The
callable
must
return
a
sequence
of
directory
and
file
names
relative
to
the
current
directory
(
i.e.
a
subset
of
the
items
in
its
second
argument
)
;
these
names
will
then
be
ignored
in
the
copy
process
.
ignore_patterns()
can
be
used
to
create
such
a
callable
that
ignores
names
based
on
glob-style
patterns
.
