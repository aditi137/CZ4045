Depends
on
your
platform

If
you're
using
*
nix
","
you
can
use
the
'
arp
'
command
to
look
up
the
mac
address
for
a
given
IP
(
assuming
IPv4
)
address
.
If
that
doesn't
work
","
you
could
ping
the
address
and
then
look
","
or
if
you
have
access
to
the
raw
network
(
using
BPF
or
some
other
mechanism
)
","
you
could
send
your
own
ARP
packets
(
but
that
is
probably
overkill
)
.
