mktime
documentation
is
a
bit
misleading
here
","
there
is
no
meaning
saying
it's
calculated
as
a
local
time
","
rather
it's
calculating
the
seconds
from
Epoch
according
to
the
supplied
tuple
-
regardless
of
your
computer
locality
.
If
you
do
want
to
do
a
conversion
from
a
utc_tuple
to
local
time
you
can
do
the
following
:
Perhaps
a
more
accurate
question
would
be
how
to
convert
a
utc_tuple
to
a
local_tuple
.
I
would
call
it
gm_tuple_to_local_tuple
(
I
prefer
long
and
descriptive
names
)

Hope
this
