If
you
don't
want
to
insert
movie
id
manually
","
change
creating
your
imdb
table
definition
with
:
"c.execute('''CREATE TABLE imdb (mov_id ROWID, Title, Rating)"
'
'
'
)
which
lets
you
omit
specifying
mov_id
in
your
insert
.
Then
","
just
add
your
record
using
just
instead
of
your
#
Insert
a
row
of
data
line
.
BTW
:
I'd
personally
do
rstrip()
on
your
Title
to
remove
newline
character
","
if
you
don't
need
it
:
Title
=
d
[4]
.
rstrip()
