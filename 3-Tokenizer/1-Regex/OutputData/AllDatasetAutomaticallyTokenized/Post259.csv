They're
useful
for
the
""""
Quick
Hack
""""
that
is
for
plugging
a
gap
in
your
main
language
for
a
quick
(
and
potentially
dirty
)
fix
faster
than
it
would
take
to
develop
the
same
in
your
main
language
.
An
example
:
a
simple
script
in
perl
to
go
through
a
large
text
file
and
replace
all
instances
of
an
email
address
with
another
is
trivial
with
an
amount
of
time
taken
in
the
10
minute
range
.
Hacking
a
console
app
together
to
do
the
same
in
your
main
language
would
take
multiples
of
that
.
You
also
have
the
benefit
that
exposing
yourself
to
additional
languages
broadens
your
abilities
and
learning
to
attack
problems
from
a
different
languages
perspective
can
be
as
valuable
as
the
language
itself
.
Finally
","
scripting
languages
are
very
useful
in
the
realm
of
extension
.
Take
LUA
as
an
example
.
You
can
bolt
a
lua
interpreter
into
your
app
with
very
little
overhead
and
you
now
have
a
way
to
create
rich
scripting
functionality
that
can
be
exposed
to
end
users
or
altered
and
distributed
quickly
without
requiring
a
rebuild
of
the
entire
app
.
This
is
used
to
great
effect
in
many
games
most
notably
World
of
Warcraft
.
