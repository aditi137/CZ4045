I'm
developing
zmq
/
protobuf
application
and
I
have
a
problem
with
deserialization
of
messages
sent
from
C
+
+
to
python
.
I
easily
handle
messages
from
python
to
C
+
+
however
in
the
other
direction
I
have
a
problem
.
Protobuf
library
in
python
client
application
complains
that
it
detected
:
File
""""
C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\google\protobuf\internal\python_message.py
""""
","
line
844
","
in
MergeFromString
raise
message_mod.DecodeError('Unexpected end-group tag.')
I
presume
there
is
a
problem
between
C
+
+
serizalization
and
python
deserialization
.
I'm
wondering
if
there
is
some
problem
with
null
terminator
in
C
/
C
+
+
.
I'm
using
RaspberryPi
running
Raspian
for
C
+
+
code
and
x64
CPU
running
Windows
7
for
python
code
.
This
is
my
C
+
+
serialization
code
.
.
This
is
my
python
deserialization
code
.
.
I
debugged
that
deserialization
fails
in
this
function
\
google\protobuf\internal\python_message.py
Could
you
help
me
with
enabling
my
application
?
