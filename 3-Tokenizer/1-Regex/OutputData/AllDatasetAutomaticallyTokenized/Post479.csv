Well
","
first
you
rewrite
LINQ
in
Python
.
Then
your
solution
is
a
one-liner
:
)
If
you
put
all
the
simple
methods
above
into
a
module
called
LINQ.py
","
you
can
impress
your
friends
.
(
Disclaimer
:
of
course
","
this
is
not
actually
rewriting
LINQ
in
Python
.
People
have
the
misconception
that
LINQ
is
just
a
bunch
of
trivial
extension
methods
and
some
new
syntax
.
The
really
advanced
part
of
LINQ
","
however
","
is
automatic
SQL
generation
so
that
when
you're
querying
a
database
","
it's
the
database
that
implements
Distinct()
rather
than
the
client
side
.
