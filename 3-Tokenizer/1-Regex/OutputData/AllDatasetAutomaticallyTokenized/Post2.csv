There
are
drawbacks
of
using
reference
counting
.
One
of
the
most
mentioned
is
circular
references
:
Suppose
A
references
B
","
B
references
C
and
C
references
B
.
If
A
were
to
drop
its
reference
to
B
","
both
B
and
C
will
still
have
a
reference
count
of
1
and
won't
be
deleted
with
traditional
reference
counting
.
CPython
(
reference
counting
is
not
part
of
python
itself
","
but
part
of
the
C
implementation
thereof
)
catches
circular
references
with
a
separate
garbage
collection
routine
that
it
runs
periodically
...
Another
drawback
:
Reference
counting
can
make
execution
slower
.
Each
time
an
object
is
referenced
and
dereferenced
","
the
interpreter
/
VM
must
check
to
see
if
the
count
has
gone
down
to
0
(
and
then
deallocate
if
it
did
)
.
Garbage
Collection
does
not
need
to
do
this
.
Also
","
Garbage
Collection
can
be
done
in
a
separate
thread
(
though
it
can
be
a
bit
tricky
)
.
On
machines
with
lots
of
RAM
and
for
processes
that
use
memory
only
slowly
","
you
might
not
want
to
be
doing
GC
at
all
!
Reference
counting
would
be
a
bit
of
a
drawback
there
in
terms
of
performance
...
