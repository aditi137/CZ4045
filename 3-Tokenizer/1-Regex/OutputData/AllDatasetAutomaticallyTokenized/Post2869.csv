Here
is
a
code
i
would
like
to
","
insert
the
value
of
""""
K
""""
and
""""
v
""""
in
cmd
after
robocopy
command
","
so
that
with
in
the
for
loop
it
will
perform
robocopy
for
all
the
source
and
destination
mentioned
in
dictionary
D
=
{
}
i
would
also
like
that
the
script
checks
for
failures
in
the
robocopy
output
logs
in
error.log
file
if
two
files
have
failed
then
the
script
should
send
a
mail
to
some
email
address
.
