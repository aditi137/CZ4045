problem

I
can
not
change
the
records
by
rows
","
cause
the
position
of
the
products
(
PROCOD
)
may
vary
.
Any
suggestions
to
get
the
PROCOD
and
change
the
value
of
PROEST
?
UPDATED

But
the
question
now
is
","
how
i
edit
the
value
based
on
the
CODIGO
field
(
Stock
code
)
.
I
have
multiples
stocks
ID
:
(
1
","
2
","
5
","
11
)
.
The
code
update
just
the
first
result
","
i
need
update
a
specific
record
based
in
the
CODIGO

be
:
""""

PROEST
SET
