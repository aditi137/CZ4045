The
question
you
are
asking
-
-
about
what
happens
when
-
-
relates
to
events
that
occur
upstream
of
Flask...like
when
gunicorn
starts
up
.
Flask
is
a
Web
Server
Gateway
Interface
(
WSGI
)
application
framework
.
WSGI
is
a
Python-specific
framework
that
defines
how
a
web
server
will
interface
with
an
application
.
(
The
Java
equivalent
is
a
Java
servlet
.
)
The
server
will
use
Python's
WSGI
protocol
to
call
Flask
when
appropriate
.
The
Flask
documentation
on
deploying
a
standalone
WSGI
application
shows
how
to
set
this
up
manually
","
and
gives
you
a
little
insight
into
what's
going
on
upstream
of
Flask
.
The
section
on
Gevent
is
useful
because
it
explicitly
shows
the
import statement
for
yourapplication
and
its
relationship
to
the
HTTP
server
:
The
source
code
for
gunicorn
shows
a
similar
approach
","
loading
the
WSGI
application
once
per
worker
","
and
then
running
indefinitely
.
...
Flask's
application
context
But
you
may
be
searching
for
a
way
to
create
some
new
variable
or
instantiate
a
new
database
connection
or
establish
a
unique
session
cookie
-
-
things
that
should
occur
every
time
a
request
is
processed
","
and
not
just
once
when
the
application
code
is
loaded
.
For
this
","
you
should
look
into
Flask's
application
context
.
From
the
cited
page
:
The
application
context
is
created
and
destroyed
as
necessary
.
It
never
moves
between
threads
and
it
will
not
be
shared
between
requests
.
As
such
it
is
the
perfect
place
to
store
database
connection
information
and
other
things
.
