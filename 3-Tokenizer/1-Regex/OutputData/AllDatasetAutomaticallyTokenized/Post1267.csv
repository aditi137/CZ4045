I
have
a
table
similar
to
this
:
I
need
to
find
sum
of
count
for
a
given
name
with
the
following
conditions
:
For
a
given
name
Flag
should
be
false
Entry
should
be
added
after
the
last
flag=true
entry
for
that
name
In
this
case
I
want
sum
of
count
for
entries
03
and
04
.
How
should
I
do
this
in
Django
?
EDIT
:
I
am
looking
for
creating
a
query
like
this
:
EDIT
:
Also
if
there
was
no
entry
with
flag=true
then
I
need
all
the
entries
for
that
name
.
