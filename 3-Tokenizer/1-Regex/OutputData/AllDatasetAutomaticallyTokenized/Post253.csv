I
think
the
main
benefits
of
dynamic
languages
can
be
boiled
down
to
Rapid
development
Glue
The
short
design-code-test
cycle
time
makes
dynamic
languages
ideal
for
prototyping
","
tools
","
and
quick
&
dirty
one-off
scripts
.
IMHO
","
the
latter
two
can
make
a
huge
impact
on
a
programmer's
productivity
.
It
amazes
me
how
many
people
trudge
through
things
manually
instead
of
whipping
up
a
tool
to
do
it
for
them
.
I
think
it's
because
they
don't
have
something
like
Perl
in
their
toolbox
.
The
ability
to
interface
with
just
about
anything
(
other
programs
or
languages
","
databases
","
etc.
)
makes
it
easy
to
reuse
existing
work
and
automate
tasks
that
would
otherwise
need
to
be
done
manually
.
