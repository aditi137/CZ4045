A
couple
quick
notes
from
quickly
skimming
the
code
:
In
get_score()
you
could
add
an
else
clause
to
handle
any
ties
that
happen
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
check
for
it
explicitly
in
play_game()
Move
the
import random
to
the
top
of
the
file
.
imports
are
generally
always
found
at
the
top
of
the
file
.
Also
","
there's
no
need
to
re-import
every
time
you
want
a
random
number
.
Not
sure
if
this
is
a
typo
","
cause
play
seems
to
always
hold
an
integer
","
but
you
have
play
=
=
True
and
play
=
=
False
inside
play_game()
.
If
you
want
to
make
play
contain
either
True
or
False
","
you
need
to
be
using
a
single
equals
sign
","
eg
","
play
=
True
.
But
this
doesn't
seem
to
make
sense
because
you're
comparing
play
to
computer
as
if
they're
integers
.
Also
","
what
are
you
trying
to
accomplish
with
the
score
variable
in
the
get_score()
method
?
Ah
","
if
you
made
the
get_score()
method
return
something
so
you
know
who
won
the
match
it
would
be
helpful
.
You
can't
access
computer_wins
or
player_wins
inside
the
get_score()
method
because
they
were
defined
inside
main()
.
A
simple
way
to
do
this
is
return
an
int
from
get_score()
.
here
is
a
rather
C-style
way
of
handling
it
(
returning
-
1
/
0
/
1
)
.
something
like
(
pseudo
code
)
:
