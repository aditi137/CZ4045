I
want
to
do
an
automation
of
the
Internet
Explorer
.
Open
the
Internet
Explorer
","
navigate
to
login.live.com
and
set
a
value
into
the
email
textbox
.
Here's
the
simple
script
:
The
last
line
always
returns
the
following
TypeError
:
getElementById()
takes
exactly
1
argument
(
2
given
)
When
I
try
to
add
the
value
through
the
console
of
the
Internet
Explorer
it
works
.
Btw
.
the
getElementsByTagName()
method
works
without
any
Errors
.
Thanks
for
any
help
!
