If
I
am
not
mistaken
","
pythonanywhere
uses
Django
1.3.7
by
default
.
It
looks
like
Django
timezone
support
was
not
added
until
version
1.4
:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/releases/1.4/#what-s-new-in-django-1-4
You
should
update
Django
to
the
most
recent
version
(
or
at
least
an
earlier
version
)
and
everything
should
work
as
expected
(
at
least
with
timezones
)
.
You
can
upgrade
by
opening
a
bash
console
from
the
Consoles
tab
on
your
pythonanywhere
profile
","
and
running
the
command
:
Or
install
a
newer
version
in
a
virtualenv
:
Edit
:
I
tested
out
my
first
suggestion
","
and
was
not
able
to
get
it
to
work
on
my
pythonanywhere
account
(
I
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
permissions
that
pythonanywhere
gives
their
users
)
.
However
","
using
the
second
method
(
i.e.
","
using
a
virtualenv
)
did
work
to
install
the
latest
version
of
Django
","
which
does
include
timezone
support
in
django.utils.timezone
.
