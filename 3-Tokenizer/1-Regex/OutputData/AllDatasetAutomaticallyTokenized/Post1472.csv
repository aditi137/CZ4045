There
can
be
several
factors
.
Two
I
can
think
off
of
right
now
:
Initial
byte
compilation
.
Python
caches
the
compiled
bytecode
in
.
pyc
files
","
on
a
first
run
that
file
needs
to
be
created
","
subsequent
runs
only
need
to
verify
the
timestamp
on
the
byte
code
cache
.
Disk
caching
The
Python
interpreter
","
the
3
libraries
you
refer
to
directly
","
anything
those
libraries
use
","
all
need
to
be
loaded
from
disk
","
quite
apart
from
the
script
and
it's
bytecode
cache
.
The
OS
caches
such
files
for
faster
access
.
If
you
ran
other
things
on
the
same
system
","
those
files
will
be
flushed
from
the
cache
and
need
to
be
loaded
again
.
The
same
applies
to
directory
listings
;
the
checks
for
where
to
find
the
modules
in
the
module
search
path
and
tests
for
bytecode
caches
all
are
sped
up
by
cached
directory
information
.
If
such
startup
times
affect
your
application
","
consider
creating
a
daemon
that
services
these
tasks
as
a
service
.
RPC
calls
(
using
sockets
or
localhost
network
connections
)
will
almost
always
beat
those
startup
costs
.
A
message
queue
could
provide
you
with
the
architecture
for
such
a
daemon
.
