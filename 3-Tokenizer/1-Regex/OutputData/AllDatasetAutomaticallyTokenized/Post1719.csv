There
is
something
that
is
tripping
me
up
with
models
","
and
I
guess
SQL
tables
in
general
.
Let
us
suppose
you
have
these
models
:
When
you
create
an
instance
of
Car
like
say
","
the
following
A
couple
questions
:
When
you
create
an
instance
of
Car
","
are
you
also
creating
an
instance
of
Manufacturer
as
a
by-product
?
Or
does
'
honda
'
need
to
exist
as
an
instance
already
.
If
not
","
is
there
a
way
to
make
an
instance
of
both
","
in
say
","
one
form
.
Can
I
make
calls
on
'
civic
'
for
things
pertaining
to
the
manufacture
?
For
example
","
could
I
get
the
'
company_created
'
data
from
the
civic
instance
?
If
not
","
why
bother
having
the
relationship
in
the
first
place
?
Thanks
so
much
in
advance
.
I
would
really
appreciate
a
thorough
answer
so
I
can
understand
models
and
relationships
fully
.
And
yes
","
I
have
read
the
docs
.
