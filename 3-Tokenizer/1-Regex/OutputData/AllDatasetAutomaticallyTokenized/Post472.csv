I
can't
really
read
your
LINQ
","
but
I
think
you're
trying
to
get
5
random
numbers
up
to
100
and
then
remove
duplicates
.
Here's
a
solution
for
that
:
But
perhaps
you're
actually
looking
for
5
distinct
random
numbers
between
0
and
100
.
In
which
case
:
Now
","
this
one
might
violate
your
sense
of
""""
not
too
many
loops
","
""""
but
presumably
Take
and
Distinct
are
just
hiding
the
looping
from
you
.
It
would
be
easy
enough
to
just
add
methods
to
Enumerable
to
hide
the
while
loop
.
