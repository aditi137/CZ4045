I
want
to
convert
a
binary
file
(
such
as
a
jpg
","
mp3
","
etc
)
to
web-safe
text
and
then
back
into
binary
data
.
I've
researched
a
few
modules
and
I
think
I'm
really
close
but
I
keep
getting
data
corruption
.
After
looking
at
the
documentation
for
binascii
I
came
up
with
this
:
When
I
try
to
open
the
converted.jpg
I
get
data
corruption
:
-
/
I
also
tried
using
b2a_base64
with
57-long
blocks
of
binary
data
.
I
took
each
block
","
converted
to
a
string
","
concatenated
them
all
together
","
and
then
converted
back
in
a2b_base64
and
got
corruption
again
.
Can
anyone
help
?
I'm
not
super
knowledgeable
on
all
the
intricacies
of
bytes
and
file
formats
.
I'm
using
Python
on
Windows
if
that
makes
a
difference
with
the
\
r\n
stuff
