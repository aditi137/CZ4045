A
side-note
:
The
proposed
solution
(
distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib()
)
does
not
work
when
there
is
more
than
one
site-packages
directory
(
as
recommended
by
this
article
)
.
It
will
only
return
the
main
site-packages
directory
.
Alas
","
I
have
no
better
solution
either
.
Python
doesn't
seem
to
keep
track
of
site-packages
directories
","
just
the
packages
within
them
.
