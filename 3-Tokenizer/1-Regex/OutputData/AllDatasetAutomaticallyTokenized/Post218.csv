Yes
","
take
a
look
at
the
""""
6.4
Packages
""""
section
in
http://docs.python.org/tut/node8.html:
Basically
","
you
can
place
a
bunch
of
files
into
a
directory
and
add
an
__init__.py
file
to
the
directory
.
If
the
directory
is
in
your
PYTHONPATH
or
sys.path
","
you
can
do
""""
import directoryname
""""
to
import everything
in
the
directory
or
""""
import directoryname
.
some_file_in_directory
""""
to
import a
specific
file
that
is
in
the
directory
.
The
__init__.py
files
are
required
to
make
Python
treat
the
directories
as
containing
packages
;
this
is
done
to
prevent
directories
with
a
common
name
","
such
as
""""
string
""""
","
from
unintentionally
hiding
valid
modules
that
occur
later
on
the
module
search
path
.
In
the
simplest
case
","
__init__.py
can
just
be
an
empty
file
","
but
it
can
also
execute
initialization
code
for
the
package
or
set
the
__all__
variable
","
described
later
.
