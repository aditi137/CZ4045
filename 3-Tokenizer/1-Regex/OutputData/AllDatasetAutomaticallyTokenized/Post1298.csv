I
have
created
a
listctrl
with
some
of
the
data
in
the
listctrl
are
very
long
","
and
instead
of
showing
all
of
the
text
it
ends
with
....
For
example
Att
PSSM_r1_0_T
is
[
-
10.179077
","
0.944198
]
|
Att
PSSM_r1_0_Y
is
....
How
would
i
be
able
to
make
it
so
it
shows
all
of
the
text
.
Something
like
Att
PSSM_r1_0_T
is
[
-
10.179077
","
0.944198
]
|
Att
PSSM_r1_0_Y
is
[
-
4.820935
","
9.914433
]
|
Att
PSSM_r1_2_I
is
[
-
8.527803
","
1.953804
]
|
Att
PSSM_r1_2_K
is
[
-
12.083334
","
-
0.183813
]
|
Att
PSSM_r1_2_V
is
[
-
14.112536
","
5.857771
]
|
1
As
the
text
is
very
long
I
would
prefer
if
it
covered
more
than
one
line
.
