I
came
across
a
question
when
I
solve
this
LeetCode
problem
.
Although
my
solution
got
accepted
by
the
system
","
I
still
do
not
have
any
idea
after
searching
online
for
the
following
question
:
What
is
the
time
complexity
of
dict.keys()
operation
?
Does
it
return
a
view
of
the
keys
or
a
real
list
(
stores
in
memory
)
of
the
keys
?
