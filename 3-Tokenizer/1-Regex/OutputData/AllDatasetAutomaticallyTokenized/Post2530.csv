I
haven't
run
this
yet
","
so
I
could
be
wrong
","
but
fetch()
is
an
asynchronous
method
that
takes
a
callback
","
and
the
callback
is
what
handles
the
response
from
the
server
when
it
comes
.
In
other
words
","
I'm
pretty
sure
all
you're
doing
here
in
this
~
1
second
is
creating
the
representations
of
the
requests
—
you're
definitely
not
waiting
for
responses
","
and
I'm
not
sure
you're
necessarily
even
sending
the
requests
.
I
don't
know
the
internal
implementation
here
","
but
you
might
be
buffering
them
in
some
sense
","
or
you
could
be
making
attempts
to
send
them
as
fast
as
possible
but
some
/
many
are
failing
—
and
you
don't
really
know
what's
actually
happening
","
because
these
asynchronous
requests
are
""""
fire
and
forget
""""
.
If
you
want
to
know
how
many
USEFUL
requests
you
can
send
","
as
in
ones
that
will
reach
the
server
and
get
a
response
","
you'd
need
to
do
the
timing
in
a
callback
","
not
in
the
thread
that's
creating
the
requests
.
