I
am
trying
to
use
PdfFileMerger()
in
PyPDF2
to
merge
pdf
files
(
see
code
)
.
However
","
my
merge
commands
are
subject
to
certain
conditions
and
it
could
turn
out
that
no
merged
pdf
file
is
generated
.
I
would
like
to
know
how
to
determine
the
page
count
after
performing
merges
using
PdfFileMerger()
.
If
nothing
else
","
I
would
like
to
know
if
the
number
of
pages
is
non-zero
.
Maintaining
a
counter
to
do
this
would
be
cumbersome
because
I
am
performing
the
merges
across
several
functions
and
would
prefer
a
more
elegant
solution
.
