the
webhandler
module
needs
access
to
several
variables
that
are
generated
in
the
datahandler
module
It
might
make
sense
to
push
any
""""
generated
""""
data
to
a
third
location
.
So
datahandler
functions
call
"config.setvar( name, value )"
when
appropriate
and
webhandler
functions
call
config.getvar( name )
when
they
need
to
.
config
would
be
a
third
sub-module
","
containing
simple
setvar
and
getvar
functions
that
you
write
(
wrappers
around
setting
/
getting
elements
of
a
global
dictionary
would
be
the
simplest
approach
)
.
Then
the
datahandler
code
would
import webhandler
","
config
but
webhandler
would
only
need
to
import config
.
I
agree
with
poke
however
","
that
the
need
for
such
a
question
betrays
the
fact
that
you
probably
haven't
yet
got
the
design
finalized
as
neatly
and
logically
as
you
thought
.
If
it
were
me
","
I
would
re-think
the
way
modules
are
divided
up
.
