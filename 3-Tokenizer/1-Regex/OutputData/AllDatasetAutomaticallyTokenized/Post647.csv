I've
installed
Ninja
IDE
on
two
Windows
machines
","
a
Windows
7
machine
with
only
standard
Python
3
installed
where
it
gives
me
that
error
you
mentioned
.
And
a
Windows
XP
machine
on
which
I
had
pythonxy
which
comes
with
PyQt
in
a
convenient
easy
to
use
installer
thus
it
worked
without
any
further
troubles
.
