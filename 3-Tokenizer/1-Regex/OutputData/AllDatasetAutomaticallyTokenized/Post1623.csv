You
are
already
using
requests
library
to
make
web
calls
.
It
has
gevent
flavour
called
grequests
:
https://github.com/kennethreitz/grequests
Overall
I
don't
immediately
see
much
reason
to
prefer
one
style
of
threading
to
the
other
","
if
your
pool
is
so
small
.
Of
course
real
threads
are
relatively
heavy
(
start
with
8MB
stack
)
","
but
you
have
to
take
that
into
proportion
to
the
size
of
your
job
.
My
take
","
try
both
(
done
)
","
verify
you
are
doing
both
right
(
to
do
)
and
let
numbers
do
the
talking
.
