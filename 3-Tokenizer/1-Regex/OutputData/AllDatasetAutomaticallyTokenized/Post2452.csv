I
am
trying
to
write
a
unit
test
for
a
piece
of
code
that
includes
using
pandas
to
read
a
CSV
file
from
a
relative
path
.
The
directory
structure
is
:
In
main.py
","
I
have
:
In
test_main.py
","
I
have
Things
work
fine
if
I
run
main.py
","
but
when
I
ask
Anaconda
to
""""
run
project
tests
""""
","
I
get
an
IOError
complaining
that
'
dat
/
file.csv
'
does
not
exist
.
It's
related
to
the
fact
that
it's
a
relative
path
","
since
when
I
change
it
to
/
home
/
user
/
...
/
thing1
/
dat
/
file.csv
","
it
works
.
Is
there
a
way
that
I
can
make
the
unit
test
work
while
keeping
the
relative
path
?
