Another
clean
solution
is
to
download
the
wheel
file
for
SciPy(compatiable with your architecture of Python)
and
use
pip
install
pythonModule.whl
and
it
should
install
SciPy
with
no
problems
.
I
had
to
do
this
the
other
day
and
I
stumbled
upon
this
website
","
which
has
many
Python
modules
already
compiled
to
binaries
.
Just
another
way
to
do
it
if
you
don't
want
to
download
Anaconda
.
I
did
this
for
NumPy
","
SciPy
","
and
Scikit-Learn
.
