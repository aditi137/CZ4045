new_row.append(image[r][c])
should
be
outside
of
the
if
.
Also
","
you're
flipping
the
image
horizontally
...
twice
.
Make
your
for
loop
use
"range(0,cols/2,3)"
.
(
That
may
also
eliminate
the
need
for
that
if
.
)
You're
also
modifying
the
original
image
in-place
;
are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
that
?
Seems
a
simpler
solution
might
be
to
loop
through
each
row
in
reverse
","
appending
to
a
row
for
the
new
image
.
