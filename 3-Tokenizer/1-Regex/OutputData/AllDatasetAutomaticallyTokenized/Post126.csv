The
filesystem
backend
is
only
worth
looking
at
if
you're
not
going
to
use
a
database
for
any
other
part
of
your
system
.
If
you
are
using
a
database
then
the
filesystem
backend
has
nothing
to
recommend
it
.
The
memcache
backend
is
much
quicker
than
the
database
backend
","
but
you
run
the
risk
of
a
session
being
purged
and
some
of
your
session
data
being
lost
.
If
you're
a
really
","
really
high
traffic
website
and
code
carefully
so
you
can
cope
with
losing
a
session
then
use
memcache
.
If
you're
not
using
a
database
use
the
file
system
cache
","
but
the
default
database
backend
is
the
best
","
safest
and
simplest
option
in
almost
all
cases
.
