To
build
on
Ben's
answer
","
you
can
also
use
:
from
your
original
post
","
but
add
the
following
line
beneath
it
so
the
coordinates
are
in
the
correct
format
for
the
task_config-->Region
field
:
It
prevents
a
""""
task_config
""""
formatting
mismatch
when
you
get
to
here
:
This
will
allow
you
to
use
the
given
function
from
the
API
","
but
it
will
extract
the
coordinates
in
such
a
way
that
you
can
use
them
in
the
approach
suggested
by
Ben
above
.
