I
have
a
dict
object
as
:
I
want
this
device
dict
to
map
to
another
dict
","
namely
","
master_device
as
:
Where
all
the
fields
in
sub
document
having
key
data
","
are
mapped
from
device
dict
.
What
is
the
'
one-liner
'
way
to
achieve
this
?
P.S
.
:
I
don't
want
it
to
be
like
:
Or
some
other
""""
for-loop
""""
way
.
(
I
simply
dont
want
this
way
)
Thanks
in
advance
.
