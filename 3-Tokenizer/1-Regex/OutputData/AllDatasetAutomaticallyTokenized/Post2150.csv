On
my
system
both
Python
and
Javascript
produce
the
same
result
(
modulo
sign
)
:
And
new
"Date(2000, 6, 1)"
.
getTimezoneOffset()
returns
-
240
(
different
sign
","
same
value
)
.
Python
uses
:
local
time
=
utc
time
+
utc
offset
definition
.
While
Javascript
uses
a
different
definition
:
utc
offset
=
utc
time
-
local
time
i.e.
","
both
results
are
correct
and
have
correct
signs
for
the
corresponding
definitions
.
For
a
portable
Javascript
solution
","
you
could
use
momentjs
library
that
provides
access
to
the
same
tz
database
as
pytz
Python
module
:
