This
is
the
code(python)
my
teacher
wrote
.
(
with
the
prime
numbers
i've
found
using
a
bruteforce
)
.
I
also
have
some
test
data
with
passwords
that
have
matching
hashes
(
not
that
it
really
matters
now
that
i've
found
the
two
primes
used
in
the
function
)
.
Can
anyone
help
me
on
the
way
of
finding
a
way
to
""""
reverse
""""
this
or
atleast
give
me
a
tip
?
