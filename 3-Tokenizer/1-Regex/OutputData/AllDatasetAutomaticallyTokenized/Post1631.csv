I
have
got
an
excel
file
","
that
was
created
by
some
rather
old
soft
.
This
file
couldn't
be
opened
in
OpenOffice(some encoding errors)
and
in
Excel
2010
at
first
it
could
only
be
opened
in
Protected
View
.
When
I
tried
to
open
it
by
xlrd
:
I
got
an
error
:
Same
thing
with
encoding
by
cp1252
","
utf-7
.
utf_16_le
","
that
was
adviced
in
similar
topic
returns
Without
encoding
I
got
additional
string
in
traceback
After
saving
file
in
Excel
2010
(
in
xlsx
)
format
this
problem
had
disappeared
-
file
can
be
opened
both
in
xlrd
and
OO
.
Is
there
any
way
to
open
such
file
by
xlrd
without
resaving
?
Upd
.
There
is
no
such
problem
for
python2.7
xlrd
.
However
I
still
don't
know
what's
wrong
with
python3.3
xlrd
.
