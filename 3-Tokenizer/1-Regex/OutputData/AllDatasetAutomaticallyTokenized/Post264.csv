The
""""
real
benefit
""""
that
an
employer
could
see
is
a
better
programmer
who
can
implement
solutions
faster
;
however
","
you
will
not
be
able
to
provide
any
hard
numbers
to
justify
the
expense
and
an
employer
will
most
likely
have
you
work
on
what
makes
money
now
as
opposed
to
having
you
work
on
things
that
make
the
future
better
.
The
only
time
you
can
get
training
on
the
employer's
dime
","
is
when
they
perceive
a
need
for
it
and
it's
cheaper
than
hiring
a
new
person
who
already
has
that
skill-set
.
