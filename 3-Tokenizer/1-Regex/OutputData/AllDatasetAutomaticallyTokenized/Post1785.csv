I
am
trying
to
update
a
couple
of
columns
in
my
SQLite
database
using
:
However
this
seems
to
take
a
very
long
time
to
even
update
one
column
.
I
have
resorted
to
using
:
in
my
SELECT
queries
which
works
a
lot
quicker
","
however
is
there
a
reason
why
the
UPDATE
method
is
so
slow
?
(
I
only
have
670K
rows
in
my
database
)
NOTE
:
My
computer
is
fairly
high-end
and
when
the
UPDATE
is
running
","
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
much
pressure
on
my
desktops
resources
.
