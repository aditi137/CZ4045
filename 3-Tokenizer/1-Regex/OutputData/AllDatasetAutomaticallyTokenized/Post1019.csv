im
trying
to
parse
lines
in
the
form
:
Where
OP
is
a
symbol
for
a
logical
gate
(
AND
","
OR
","
NOT
)
and
something
is
the
thing
i
want
to
evaluate
.
The
output
im
looking
for
is
something
like
:
Where
a
condition
itself
can
be
a
dict
/
list
pair
itself
(
nested
conditions
)
.
So
far
i
tried
something
like
:
I
tried
other
ways
aswell
but
i
just
can't
wrap
my
head
around
this
whole
recursion
thing
so
im
wondering
if
i
could
get
some
pointers
here
","
i
looked
around
the
web
and
i
found
some
stuff
about
recursive
descent
parsing
but
the
tutorials
were
all
trying
to
do
something
more
complicated
than
i
needed
.
PS
:
i
realize
i
could
do
this
with
existing
python
libraries
but
what
would
i
learn
by
doing
that
eh
?
