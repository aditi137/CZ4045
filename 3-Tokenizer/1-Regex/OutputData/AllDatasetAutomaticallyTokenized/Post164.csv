I've
been
really
enjoying
Python
programming
lately
.
I
come
from
a
background
of
a
strong
love
for
C-based
coding
","
where
everything
is
perhaps
more
complicated
than
it
should
be
(
but
puts
hair
on
your
chest
","
at
least
)
.
So
switching
from
C
to
Python
for
more
complex
things
that
don't
require
tons
of
speed
has
been
more
of
a
boon
than
a
bane
in
writing
projects
.
However
","
coming
from
this
land
of
brackets
and
parentheses
and
structs
as
far
as
the
naked
eye
can
see
","
I
come
across
a
small
problem
:
I
find
Python
difficult
to
read
.
For
example
","
the
following
block
of
text
is
hard
for
me
to
decipher
unless
I
stare
at
it
(
which
I
dislike
doing
)
:
The
problem
occurs
at
the
end
of
that
if
block
:
all
the
tabbing
and
then
suddenly
returning
to
a
jarring
block
feels
almost
disturbing
.
As
a
solution
","
I've
started
coding
my
Python
like
this
:
And
this
","
for
some
odd
reason
","
makes
me
more
able
to
read
my
own
code
.
But
I'm
curious
:
has
anyone
else
with
my
strange
problem
found
easier
ways
to
make
their
tabbed-out
code
more
readable
?
I'd
love
to
find
out
if
there's
a
better
way
to
do
this
before
this
becomes
a
huge
habit
for
me
.
