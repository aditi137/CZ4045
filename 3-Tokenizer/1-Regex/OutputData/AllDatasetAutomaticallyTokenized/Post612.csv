If
you
look
at
the

Partition

section
of
the
Partiton
(
number
theory
)
page
on
Wikipedia
","
you'll
see
that
there
isn't
a
simple
way
to
find
the
partition
number
.
Instead
","
your
best
bet
is
probably
:
or
","
slightly
simpler
but
memory
hogging
for
large
numbers
using
your
existing
function
.
Also
note
if
you
want
to
be
able
to
save
the
values
returned
by
P
","
you
should
be
yielding
p
[
:
]
not
p
-
-
you
want
to
make
a
copy
","
not
yield
the
same
list
(
which
you
change
)
over
and
over
.
You
can
see
why
if
you
do
list(P(6)
)
-
-
it
returns
a
list
of
the
same
empty
list
repeated
over
and
over
.
