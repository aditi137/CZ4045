It
looks
like
you
tried
to
search
for
'
Lang
'
key
through
all
dictionaries
in
your
PDF
file
.
To
check
the
language
information
from
a
PDF
file
","
you
need
to
check
'
Lang
'
entry
in
the
catalog
.
However
the
existance
of
this
entry
depends
on
PDF
creating
software
which
is
used
to
create
the
PDF
file
and
most
PDF
files
do
not
have
this
entry
.
I
do
not
understand
Python
code
but
I
belive
that
the
PDF
library
you
are
using
will
provide
you
the
access
to
the
trailer
(
dictionary
)
or
catalog
(
root
)
dictionray
.
If
you
have
an
access
to
the
trailer
dict
","
get
'
Root
'
value
from
the
dict
.
This
is
the
indirect
reference
to
Catalog
(
Root
)
dictionary
.
Then
resolve
this
reference
to
dict
to
get
the
catalog
dictionary
.
Taking
/
Lang
value
from
this
catalog
dict
will
give
you
the
attribute
