I've
made
the
decision
to
enter
the
world
of
mobile
app
development
.
I've
gotten
pretty
familiar
with
Kivy
in
order
to
do
this
.
I'm
running
into
wall
after
wall
trying
to
deploy
anything
I
make
.
First
off
","
I
am
absolutely
unable
to
create
a
working
VM
on
my
machine
at
home
.
I
attempted
to
Enable
virtualization
in
my
machine's
BIOS
so
I
could
use
the
64-bit
version
of
Ubuntu
","
and
I
can't
find
the
option
in
the
menus
.
The
32-bit
option
throws
a
fatal
""""
kernel
panic
""""
error
at
installation
.
I
installed
the
new
Bash
on
Ubuntu
on
Windows
utility
in
an
attempt
to
use
that
to
run
the
Buildozer
tool
to
package
my
.
apk
file
.
However
","
Buildozer
cannot
be
run
as
root
.
I
get
a
security
issue
when
trying
to
access
the
app
directory
(
which
lives
on
my
Windows
host's
home
drive
)
as
a
non-root
user
.
On
top
of
that
","
I've
tried
to
move
the
files
into
the
lxss
folder
","
where
the
Ubuntu
files
seem
to
live
.
I'm
running
out
of
options
entirely
.
My
entire
process
is
being
stymied
because
of
this
one
tool
simply
not
cooperating
.
What
can
I
do
to
get
Buildozer
to
run
properly
knowing
that
I'm
almost
exclusively
limited
to
a
Windows
machine
?
Edit
:
The
VM
image
at
https://kivy.org/#download
will
not
run
for
me
either
.
It
gets
hung
up
while
booting
.
