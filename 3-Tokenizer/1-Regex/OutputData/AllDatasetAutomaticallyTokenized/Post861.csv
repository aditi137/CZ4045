Taking
you
very
literally
","
and
if
you
just
mean
""""
to
stub
them
out
so
that
they
won't
be
loaded
by
a
straight
import
""""
","
not
""""
make
them
unloadable
by
untrusted
code
""""
","
then
:
Of
course
","
there
is
no
module
system
so
you
might
have
meant
sys
","
in
which
case
you're
in
trouble
.
If
you're
trying
to
keep
untrusted
code
from
being
able
to
do
Bad
Things
","
then
take
a
look
at
http://wiki.python.org/moin/SandboxedPython
and
realise
that
you're
after
something
not
immediately
feasible
.
