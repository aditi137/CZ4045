I'm
the
one
supporting
CairoPlot
and
I'm
very
proud
it
came
up
here
.
Surely
matplotlib
is
great
","
but
I
believe
CairoPlot
is
better
looking
.
So
","
for
presentations
and
websites
","
it's
a
very
good
choice
.
Today
I
released
version
1.1
.
If
interested
","
check
it
out
at
CairoPlot
v1.1
EDIT
:
After
a
long
and
cold
winter
","
CairoPlot
is
being
developed
again
.
Check
out
the
new
version
on
GitHub
.
