As
other
answers
have
stated
","
check
that
port
3050
is
open
.
However
","
fdb
only
supports
Firebird
2.0
or
higher
.
For
Firebird
1.5
","
you
can
use
either
pyodbc
or
pyfirebirdsql
Note
that
","
among
other
issues
(
like
not
handling
Firebird
INTEGER
datatypes
properly
)
","
pyfirebirdsql
isn't
100
%
compliant
with
PEP
249
-
-
Python
DB
API
2.0
as
calls
to
Cursor.rowcount
always
return
-
1
.
Edit
:
After
posting
this
","
I
took
it
upon
myself
to
write
the
code
for
pyfirebirdsql's
rowcount
function
","
so
now
it
works
as
expected
","
instead
of
always
returning
1
.
Shortly
after
that
","
the
pyfirebirdsql
author
fixed
the
INTEGER
issues
as
well
.
