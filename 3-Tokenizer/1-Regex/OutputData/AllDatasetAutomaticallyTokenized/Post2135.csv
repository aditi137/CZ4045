If
you're
splitting
the
text
file
into
words
based
on
whitespace
","
just
use
split()
on
the
whole
thing
.
There's
nothing
to
be
gained
by
reading
each
line
and
stripping
it
","
because
split()
already
handles
all
that
.
So
to
get
the
initial
list
of
words
","
all
you
need
is
this
:
Then
to
remove
duplicates
","
convert
the
word
list
to
a
set
:
And
finally
sort
it
:
This
can
all
be
simplified
to
three
lines
","
like
so
:
(
NB
:
the
with
statement
will
automatically
close
the
file
for
you
)
