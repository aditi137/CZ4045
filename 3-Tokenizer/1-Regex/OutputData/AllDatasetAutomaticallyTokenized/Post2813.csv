I
am
a
beginner
in
Python
and
programming
in
general
and
I'm
trying
to
solve
a
problem
on
codingbat.com
(
the
problem
is
called
""""
array_front9
""""
under
the
section
""""
Warmup-2
""""
)
.
The
problem
is
:
""""
Given
an
array
of
ints
","
return
True
if
one
of
the
first
4
elements
in
the
array
is
a
9
.
The
array
length
may
be
less
than
4
.
""""
Here
is
my
code
which
works
if
I
create
a
list
and
then
run
it
locally
(
on
codingbat.com
it
is
necessary
to
create
a
function
but
I
do
not
create
a
function
to
test
my
code
locally
)
:
Here
is
the
code
I'm
trying
to
run
on
codingbat.com
but
I
receive
""""
Error:list
index
out
of
range
""""
error
:
Here
is
the
solution
according
to
codingbat.com
:
Here
is
the
current
URL
for
this
problem
:
http://codingbat.com/prob/p110166
Can
anyone
point
me
to
what
I'm
doing
wrong
?
