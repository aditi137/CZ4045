If
you
are
working
in
the
same
directory
","
that
is
","
b.py
is
in
the
same
folder
as
a.py
","
I
am
unable
to
reproduce
this
problem
(
and
do
not
know
why
this
problem
occurs
)
","
but
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
post
what
os.getcwd()
returns
for
b.py
.
If
that's
not
the
case
","
add
this
on
top
of
b.py
OR
if
they
are
in
the
same
path
","
