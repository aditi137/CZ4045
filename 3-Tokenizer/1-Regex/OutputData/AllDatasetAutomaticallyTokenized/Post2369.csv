I
have
data
from
a
csv
file
that
looks
like
this
:
I
want
to
plot
the
exit_status
count
(
i.e
the
amount
of
times
exit_status
=
=
1
or
exit_status
=
=
-
11
)
versus
start_time
in
bins
of
1
hour
.
Since
there
are
several
distinct
exit_status
codes
","
I
need
to
plot
it
in
the
form
of
a
stacked
bar
chart
where
each
distinct
exit
status
is
given
a
different
color
.
Can
anyone
please
help
me
?
I've
been
stuck
on
this
for
2
days
!
!
Thanks
!
