I've
a
fully
functional
python
code
who
generates
some
hashes
and
uses
cryptography
.
It
is
an
implementation
of
MS-CHAPV2
GenerateNTResponse()
method
so
I
use
SHA1
","
MD4
and
DES
.
Since
I
need
to
deal
with
almost
10000000
hashes
","
I
was
looking
for
a
way
to
speed
it
up
by
using
CUDA
.
The
pure
python
version
takes
something
like
2
hours
to
generate
about
the
90
%
of
all
the
hashes
.
Now
the
problem
is
:
can
I
reuse
the
python
code
and
adapt
it
to
PyCuda
?
I've
not
found
any
kind
of
information
about
it
so
","
following
some
of
the
examples
","
I'm
trying
to
do
it
in
C
using
PyCuda's
SourceModule
.
But
here
comes
another
problem
:
So
","
as
far
as
I
know
","
only
functions
declared
with
__device__
can
be
used
in
SourceModule
.
But
how
can
I
do
it
with
openssl
/
sha.h
functions
?
Here's
the
simple
testing
code
that
I'm
using
to
calculate
SHA1
with
PyCuda
