I
am
trying
to
develop
a
program
that
a
user
enters
in
some
text
then
press
submit
and
it
would
take
the
text
in
the
entry
field
and
compare
it
to
another
value
.
The
code
is
intended
to
print
to
the
console
""""
hello
""""
if
""""
hello
""""
is
written
in
the
entry
field
before
the
user
presses
submit
.
However
","
the
code
does
not
print
""""
hello
""""
to
the
console
","
any
suggestions
?
