MyClass1
You
may
want
to
do
the
addition
and
store
the
sum
in
the
__init__()
method
to
avoid
having
it
recalculated
every
time
doAdd()
is
called
.
And
like
@gragas
says
","
this
method
lets
you
store
the
data
for
later
use
in
other
methods
.
MyClass2
You're
not
using
any
object
oriented
features
here
","
so
it
might
as
well
just
be
a
regular
function
.
