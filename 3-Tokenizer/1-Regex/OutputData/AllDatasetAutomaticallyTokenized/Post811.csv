I
am
looking
for
a
mechanism
to
sync
between
scripts
(
bash
or
perl
or
Python
)
My
requirement
is
as
follows
Scripts
a
","
b
and
c
will
start
(
not
necessarily
at
the
same
time
)
.
Once
a
","
b
","
or
c
hits
a
certain
point
in
the
script
","
it
should
stop
for
other
scripts
to
hit
the
same
point
.
For
the
sake
of
discussion
lets
call
these
as
syncpoints
.
Once
the
syncpoint
is
hit
","
by
all
scripts
","
all
scripts
can
proceed
to
next
syncpoint
or
end
of
script
Here
is
an
example
Script
