Will
split
on
the
literal
sequence
of
three
characters
single
quote
","
space
","
single
quote
","
which
don't
appear
in
your
command
strings
.
I
think
you
will
need
to
approach
this
more
like
:
Note
the
use
of
a
second
argument
to
tell
split
how
many
times
to
do
so
;
'
set
title
""""
"foo""'.split"
(
""""
""""
","
1
)
=
=
[
'
set
'
","
'
title
""""
foo
""""
'
]
.
Precisely
how
you
implement
will
depend
on
the
range
of
things
you
want
to
be
able
to
parse
.
