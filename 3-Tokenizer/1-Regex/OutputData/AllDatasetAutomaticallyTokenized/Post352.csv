PythonCard
is
really
easy
to
use
.
That's
what
I
would
recommend
.
Here's
their
writeup
:
PythonCard
is
a
GUI
construction
kit
for
building
cross-platform
desktop
applications
on
Windows
","
Mac
OS
X
","
and
Linux
","
using
the
Python
language
.
The
PythonCard
motto
is
""""
Simple
things
should
be
simple
and
complex
things
should
be
possible
.
""""
PythonCard
is
for
you
if
you
want
to
develop
graphical
applications
quickly
and
easily
with
a
minimum
of
effort
and
coding
.
Apple's
HyperCard
is
one
of
our
inspirations
;
simple
","
yet
powerful
.
PythonCard
uses
wxPython
.
If
you
are
already
familiar
with
wxPython
","
just
think
of
PythonCard
as
a
simpler
way
of
doing
wxPython
programs
with
a
whole
lot
of
samples
and
tools
already
in
place
for
you
to
copy
and
subclass
