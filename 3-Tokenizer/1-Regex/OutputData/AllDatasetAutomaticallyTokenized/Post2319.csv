I
have
a
python
DataFrame
from
Pandas
Every
time
I
construct
this
DataFrame
","
the
number
and
name
of
columns
after
the
snapDate
are
different
.
I
would
need
to
construct
a
new
DataFrame
by
selecting
snapDate
as
the
indexcolumn
but
the
remaining
columns
should
be
dynamically
selected
for
plotting
any
ideas
.
How
can
I
achieve
this
?
for
the
df
above
","
I
should
always
select
the
snapDate
column
and
all
the
columns
after
the
snapDate
column
The
number
and
name
of
the
columns
after
the
snapDate
column
will
vary
.
My
objective
is
to
do
I
want
to
create
a
plot
from
the
DataFrame
by
always
picking
the
SnapDate
column
and
the
remaining
columns
which
depending
on
the
DataFrame
could
be
2
or
3
or
4
etc.
