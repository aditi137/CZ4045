Having
some
spare
time
","
I
have
modified
your
code
.
The
code
you
supplied
is
riddled
with
small
coding
and
logical
errors
.
You
would
be
best
running
the
diff
command
between
your
original
code
and
the
code
below
","
to
see
where
the
many
differences
are
and
there
is
no
guarantee
that
is
bug
free
now
either
.
I
hope
you're
not
planning
on
fleecing
your
fellow
pupils
","
the
rebalance
routine
is
the
twisted
work
of
a
future
loan-shark
