I'm
confused
as
when
to
exactly
use
assertion
testing
in
my
python
functions
.
If
I
specify
assumptions
regarding
the
input
arguments
to
a
function
","
should
I
assume
that
correct
input
is
being
fed
to
the
function
or
should
I
use
assertions
to
check
the
conditions
on
the
input
args
enumerated
in
the
specification
?
