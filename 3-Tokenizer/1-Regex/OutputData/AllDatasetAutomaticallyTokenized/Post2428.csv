Okay
","
to
be
clear
I've
searched
and
read
","
followed
the
official
docs
","
tried
multiple
solutions
from
SOF
","
nothing
seems
to
be
working
so
I
have
to
resort
to
shamefully
asking
for
help
.
I'm
simply
trying
to
generate
urls
the
proper
way
.
root
urls.py
:
urls.py
:
template
file
:
also
tried
:
Error
:
Reverse
for
'
vieworder
'
with
arguments
'
(
1
","
)
'
and
keyword
arguments
'
{
}
'
not
found
.
1
pattern(s)
tried
:
[
'
|
/
vieworder
/
(
?
P<order_id>d
+
)
/
$
'
]
I
don't
understand
why
this
is
not
working
.
I
tested
the
regex
against
vieworder
/
1
/
in
a
regex
tester
and
it
works
fine
.
Django
even
tells
me
in
the
error
that
it
tried
the
correct
url
pattern
","
however
the
error
really
isn't
very
clear
on
what
is
actually
wrong
.
