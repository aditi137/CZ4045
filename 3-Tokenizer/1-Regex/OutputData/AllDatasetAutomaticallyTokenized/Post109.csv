I
think
this
is
cleaner
:
and
gets
the
same
information
as
:
Where
[0]
is
the
current
frame
in
the
stack
(
top
of
stack
)
and
[1]
is
for
the
file
name
","
increase
to
go
backwards
in
the
stack
i.e.
would
be
the
file
name
of
the
script
that
called
the
current
frame
.
Also
","
using
[
-
1
]
will
get
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
stack
","
the
original
calling
script
.
