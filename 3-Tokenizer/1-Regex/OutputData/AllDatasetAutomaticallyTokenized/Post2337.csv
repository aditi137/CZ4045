I
got
a
weird
problem
that
I
wasn't
been
able
to
find
answer
all
over
the
internet
(
or
I
don't
know
how
to
ask
)
.
I
have
module
AAA.py
and
module
BBB.py
then
when
I
call
everything
works
as
expected
and
I
see
output
BUT
when
I
try
to
import and
use
class
AAA
from
module
BBB.py
I
get
following
error
Any
suggestions
?
I
cant
create
circular
dependencies
in
Python
?
I
am
using
version
Python
2.7.6
on
Ubuntu
