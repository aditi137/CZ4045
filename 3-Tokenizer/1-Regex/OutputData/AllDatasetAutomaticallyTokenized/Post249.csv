Personally
I
work
on
a
Java
app
","
but
I
couldn't
get
by
without
perl
for
some
supporting
scripts
.
I've
got
scripts
to
quickly
flip
what
db
I'm
pointing
at
","
scripts
to
run
build
scripts
","
scripts
to
scrape
data
&
compare
stuff
.
Sure
I
could
do
all
that
with
java
","
or
maybe
shell
scripts
(
I've
got
some
of
those
too
)
","
but
who
wants
to
compile
a
class
(
making
sure
the
classpath
is
set
right
etc
)
when
you
just
need
something
quick
and
dirty
.
Knowing
a
scripting
language
can
remove
90
%
of
those
boring
/
repetitive
manual
tasks
.
