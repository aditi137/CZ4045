If
all
you
have
is
a
hammer
","
every
problem
begins
to
look
like
a
nail
.
There
are
times
when
having
a
screwdriver
or
pair
of
pliers
makes
a
complicated
problem
trivial
.
Nobody
asks
contractors
","
carpenters
","
etc

Why
learn
to
use
a
screwdriver
if
i
already
have
a
hammer
?
""""
.
Really
good
contractors
/
carpenters
have
tons
of
tools
and
know
how
to
use
them
well
.
All
programmers
should
be
doing
the
same
thing
","
learning
to
use
new
tools
and
use
them
well
.
But
before
we
use
any
power
tools
","
lets
take
a
moment
to
talk
about
shop
safety
.
Be
sure
to
read
","
understand
","
and
follow
all
the
safety
rules
that
come
with
your
power
tools
.
Doing
so
will
greatly
reduce
the
risk
of
personal
injury
.
And
remember
this
:
there
is
no
more
important
rule
than
to
wear
these
:
safety
glasses
