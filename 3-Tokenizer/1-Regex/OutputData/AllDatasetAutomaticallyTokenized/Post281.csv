I
use
CherryPy
as
my
web
server
(
which
comes
bundled
with
Turbogears
)
","
and
I
simply
run
multiple
instances
of
the
CherryPy
web
server
on
different
ports
bound
to
localhost
.
Then
I
configure
Apache
with
mod_proxy
and
mod_rewrite
to
transparently
forward
requests
to
the
proper
port
based
on
the
HTTP
request
.
