So
currently
I
have
something
like
this
:
Model
:
Admin
:
I
create
these
objects
in
code
-
meaning
I
set
the
report
object
.
But
what
I
would
like
in
the
Django
admin
is
if
I
could
allow
a
user
to
edit
that
report
object
but
only
the
one
set
.
They
would
be
allowed
to
change
it
(
so
hopefully
the
drop
down
menu
would
no
longer
be
there
)
so
the
nice
pencil
icon
would
still
be
there
","
but
things
like
that
""""
+
""""
icon
would
be
gone
.
And
this
is
not
to
say
the
user
can't
edit
all
reports
","
it's
just
that
in
the
ConfirmEmail
Admin
they
can
only
view
that
specific
report
attached
to
it
.
I've
been
smacking
away
at
this
and
can't
seem
to
get
it
work
.
I
would
also
be
inclined
to
just
have
the
current
Report
Form
embedded
into
the
ConfirmEmail
form
-
but
don't
know
how
I
would
go
about
doing
that
.
