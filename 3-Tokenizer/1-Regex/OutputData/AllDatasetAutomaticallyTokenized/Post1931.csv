There
is
an
itertools
recipe
called
partition
that
can
do
this
.
Here
is
the
implementation
:
From
itertools
recipes
:
Upper
and
Lowercase
Letters
You
can
manually
implement
the
latter
recipe
","
or
install
a
library
that
implements
it
for
you
","
e.g
.
pip
install
more_itertools
:
Here
partition
uses
a
predicate
function
to
determine
if
each
item
in
an
iterable
is
lowercase
.
If
not
","
it
is
filtered
into
the
false
group
.
Otherwise
","
it
is
filtered
into
the
group
of
true
items
.
We
iterate
to
expose
these
groups
.
Even
and
Odd
Indices
You
can
modify
this
to
work
for
odd
and
even
indices
as
well
:
Here
we
zip
an
itertools.count()
object
to
enumerate
the
iterable
.
Then
we
iterate
the
children
so
that
the
sub
items
yield
the
letters
only
.
