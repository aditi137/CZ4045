I
have
the
following
snippet
in
Python
.
Here
","
load
is
the
list
created
from
reading
an
input
csv
file
.
After
searching
on
line
","
I
understand
what
are
the
purposes
of
function
calls
islice
and
chain_from_iterable
.
The
question
for
me
here
is
:
why
do
we
need
to
repeat(load)
here
?
Does
that
mean
we
make
copies
of
the
list
obtained
from
the
input
csv
file
and
handle
them
based
on
the
task_id
or
things
like
that
?
Sort
of
in
a
parallel
fashion
?
I
am
pretty
sure
I
can
learn
Python
very
well
","
but
right
now
I
am
kindof
new
to
Python
.
