I
want
to
use
some
functions
from
a
shared
library
in
python
.
From
the
python
doc
","
I
know
ctypes
is
a
good
choice
.
However
such
library
have
some
undefined
symbols
and
I
should
link
it
to
another
shared
library
to
get
the
symbols
.
In
g
+
+
","
it
is
simple
:
g
+
+
main.cpp
-
la
-
lb
.
The
function
I
need
is
in
liba.so
","
and
liba.so
has
some
undefined
function
which
can
be
solved
in
libb.so
.
But
how
to
do
that
in
ctypes
?
ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('liba.so')
said
that
there
are
some
undefined
symbols
","
how
to
tell
ctypes
to
find
libb.so
?
Because
ldd
liba.so
not
show
a
link
to
libb.so
.
Example
:
I
want
to
use
some
functions
in
gsl
.
In
g
+
+
:
and
ldd
libgsl.so
does
not
show
a
link
to
libgslcblas
In
python
:
how
to
tell
ctypes
to
find
libgslcblas
?
The
same
problem
also
happen
if
I
use
scalapack
.
I
use
ubuntu
16.04
