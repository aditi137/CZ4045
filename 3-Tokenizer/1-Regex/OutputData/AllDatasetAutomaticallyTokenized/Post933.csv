For
input
files
you
could
use
fileinput
module
.
It
follows
common
convention
for
input
files
:
if
no
files
given
or
filename
is
'
-
'
it
reads
stdin
","
otherwise
it
reads
from
files
given
at
a
command-line
.
There
is
no
need
in
-
f
and
-
-
file
options
.
If
your
program
always
requires
an
input
file
then
it
is
not
an
option
.
-
o
and

output
is
used
to
specify
the
output
file
name
in
various
programs
.
optparse
argparse
argparse
module
allows
you
to
specify
explicitly
files
as
arguments

I've
added

-
inplace
option
in
the
second
example
:
