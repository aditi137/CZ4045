The
reason
for
spaces
is
that
tabs
are
optional
.
Spaces
are
the
actual
lowest-common
denominator
in
punctuation
.
Every
decent
text
editor
has
a
""""
replace
tabs
with
spaces
""""
and
many
people
use
this
.
But
not
always
.
While
some
text
editors
might
replace
a
run
of
spaces
with
a
tab
","
this
is
really
rare
.
Bottom
Line
.
You
can't
go
wrong
with
spaces
.
You
might
go
wrong
with
tabs
.
So
don't
use
tabs
and
reduce
the
risk
of
mistakes
.
