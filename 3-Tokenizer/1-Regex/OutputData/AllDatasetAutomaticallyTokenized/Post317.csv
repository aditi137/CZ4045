Some
kind
of
simple
web
service
would
suffice
.
You
would
have
to
consider
security
so
not
just
anyone
could
make
requests
to
your
service
.
.
On
a
larger
scale
we
considered
a
JMS
messaging
system
.
Put
a
serialized
object
of
data
containing
the
traceback
/
error
message
into
a
queue
and
consume
it
every
x
minutes
generating
reports
/
alerts
from
that
data
.
