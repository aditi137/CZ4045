If
you
can
do
without
using
a
browser
","
you
can
use
one
of
Python
Plotting
Libraries
.
If
you
insist
on
using
the
browser
","
you
would
be
better
off
using
a
javascript-based
library
for
the
view
.
I
have
used
web2py
web
framework
before
along
with
protovis
.
But
a
simpler
web
framework
like
Bottle
or
CherryPy
can
also
be
used
to
pass
the
data
to
the
view
.
Bottle
has
a
Simple
Template
Engine
(
very
similar
to
what
I
used
in
Web2py
)
.
Developing
in
two
languages
(
one
of
which
is
javascript
)
is
a
bit
of
a
pain
.
You
could
use
something
like
Pyjamas
that
translates
python
into
javascript
but
I
am
not
really
sure
if
this
would
work
out
well
","
and
I
have
no
experience
with
it
.
