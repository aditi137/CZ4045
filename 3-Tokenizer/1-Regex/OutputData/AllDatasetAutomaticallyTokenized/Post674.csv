It
is
possible
","
but
not
too
simple
.
You
should
inform
yourself
about
the
API
and
maybe
have
a
look
at
some
implementations
.
If
you
have
done
so
","
you
can
maybe
provide
a
function
which
not
only
gives
you
a
peek
at
the
raw
array
","
but
maybe
even
reassembles
it
into
the
right
order
and
length
(
if
it
is
a
circular
buffer
)
.
This
might
be
very
convenient
as
you
nevertheless
have
to
copy
the
data
.
