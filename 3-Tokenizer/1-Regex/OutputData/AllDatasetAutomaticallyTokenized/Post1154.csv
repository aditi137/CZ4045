I
have
a
program
which
uses
QThreads
and
Signals
/
Slots
to
communicate
to
a
GUI
.
It
has
the
simplified
form
shown
below
.
However
","
I
would
like
to
change
this
to
a
QProcess
so
that
I
can
take
advantage
of
multicore
processing
.
Is
there
a
simple
way
to
do
this
?
If
I
simply
change
QThread
to
QProcess
","
there
is
no
moveToThread()
function
for
processes
.
I
have
been
trying
several
different
approaches
to
multicore
processing
","
such
as
Pipes()
and
Queues()
in
the
multiprocessing
module
","
but
I
can't
get
anything
to
work
very
well
.
So
","
I
figured
it
would
be
easier
to
use
QProcess
since
I
am
already
in
Qtland
.
Here
is
the
simplified
code
I
have
for
QThreads
","
signals
and
slots
.
