I'm
new
to
python
","
and
I
have
the
following
problem
:
I
am
trying
to
minimize
a
python
function
that
has
a
numpy
array
as
one
of
its
arguments
.
When
I
use
scipy.optimize.fmin
","
it
turns
my
array
into
a
list
(
which
results
in
the
function
failing
to
evaluate
)
.
Is
there
an
optimization
function
that
does
accept
numpy
arrays
as
function
arguments
?
Thanks
in
advance
!
