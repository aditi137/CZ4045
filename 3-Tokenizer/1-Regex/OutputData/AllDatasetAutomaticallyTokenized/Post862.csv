Yes
","
you
can
use
Python
from
the
command
line
.
python
-
c
<
stuff
>
will
run
<
stuff
>
as
Python
code
.
Example
:
There
isn't
a
direct
equivalent
to
the
-
p
option
for
Perl
(
the
automatic
input
/
output
line-by-line
processing
)
","
but
that's
mostly
because
Python
doesn't
use
the
same
concept
of
$_
and
whatnot
that
Perl
does
-
in
Python
","
all
input
and
output
is
done
manually
(
via
raw_input()
/
input()
","
and
print
/
print()
)
.
For
your
particular
example
:
(
Obviously
somewhat
more
unwieldy
.
It's
probably
better
to
just
write
the
script
to
do
it
in
actual
Python
.
