I
have
two
models
:
The
relationship
is
one-to-many
(
one
answer
has
many
photos
)
I
need
to
write
a
reporting
function
that
outputs
all
answers
along
with
corresponding
photos
.
Here
is
what
I
have
:
This
works
","
but
as
you
can
see
it
already
","
the
number
of
times
for
photo
in
answer.photos.all()
will
be
executed
equal
to
the
number
of
answers
in
the
db
.
Preferably
","
I
would
like
to
only
execute
two
db
querys
","
one
fetches
all
of
the
answers
and
the
other
fetches
all
of
the
photos
.
So
I
tried
this
:
This
approach
has
decreased
the
number
of
db
queries
down
to
two
but
it
takes
even
longer
to
execute
as
whole
.
9.5
seconds
for
this
approach
vs
7.5
seconds
for
the
1st
approach
.
Any
suggestions
on
how
to
be
more
effcient
?
Thank
you
!
P.S
.
I
am
using
Django
1.8.2
UPDATE
:
I
used
the
method
suggested
by
@Mark
Galloway
","
and
the
execution
time
has
dropped
to
1.6
seconds
.
The
number
of
queries
becomes
3
.
Django
performed
the
following
query
:
select
*
from
answer
select
*
from
photo
select
*
from
photo
where
'
photo.answer_id
'
in
(
19
","
20
","
3
...
)
#
the
numbers
inside
the
(
)
does
not
seem
to
be
continous
I
wonder
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
last
query
?
