In
my
opinion
","
Python's
syntax
is
much
cleaner
","
simpler
","
and
consistent
.
You
can
define
nested
data
structures
the
same
everywhere
","
whether
you
plan
to
pass
them
to
a
function
(
or
return
them
from
one
)
or
use
them
directly
.
I
like
Perl
a
lot
","
but
as
soon
as
I
learned
enough
Python
to
""""
get
""""
it
","
I
never
turned
back
.
In
my
experience
","
random
snippets
of
Python
tend
to
be
more
readable
than
random
snippets
of
Perl
.
The
difference
really
comes
down
to
the
culture
around
each
language
","
where
Perl
users
often
appreciate
cleverness
while
Python
users
more
often
prefer
clarity
.
That's
not
to
say
you
can't
have
clear
Perl
or
devious
Python
","
but
those
are
much
less
common
.
Both
are
fine
languages
and
solve
many
of
the
same
problems
.
I
personally
lean
toward
Python
","
if
for
no
other
reason
in
that
it
seems
to
be
gaining
momentum
while
Perl
seems
to
be
losing
users
to
Python
and
Ruby
.
Note
the
abundance
of
weasel
words
in
the
above
.
Honestly
","
it's
really
going
to
come
down
to
personal
preference
.
