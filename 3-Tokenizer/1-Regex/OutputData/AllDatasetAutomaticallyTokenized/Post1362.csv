From
looking
at
the
faq
","
it
looks
like
what
you
need
to
do
is
add
the
following
line
to
your
Python
file
:
Then
","
it
looks
like
you
need
to
run
your
script
by
using
the
Python
interpreter
bundled
with
Sage
from
the
command
line
/
console
:
However
","
if
you
want
to
use
Sage
directly
from
the
shell
","
you
should
probably
try
using
the
interactive
shell
.
(
just
type
in
sage
or
maybe
sage
-
python
from
the
command
line
)
Caveat
:
I
haven't
tested
any
of
this
myself
","
so
you
might
need
to
do
a
bit
of
experimenting
to
get
everything
to
work
.
