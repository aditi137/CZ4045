I'm
currently
reading
a
config
file
getting
all
values
from
a
specific
section
and
printing
them
however
","
instead
of
printing
them
I
would
like
to
create
a
new
config
file
with
just
that
section
I
am
reading
.
How
would
I
go
about
this
?
code
config
ini
Also
while
I'm
here
","
I'm
not
sure
how
I
would
get
this
to
work
with
encoded
strings
like
""""
Ã±
""""
as
it
errors
","
however
I
need
my
new
config
file
exactly
how
I'm
reading
it
.
