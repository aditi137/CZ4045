I've
just
started
out
Python
and
was
trying
to
make
a
countdown
timer
and
make
it
unbreakable
as
possible
","
however
when
I
enter
blank
inputs
","
the
while
loop
won't
handle
it
","
and
this
message
would
show
up
instead
:
invalid
literal
for
int()
with
base
10
:
'
'
.
It
also
pointed
the
error
occurring
at
the
line
where
it
asks
for
count-down
.
Any
help
will
be
appreciated
.
