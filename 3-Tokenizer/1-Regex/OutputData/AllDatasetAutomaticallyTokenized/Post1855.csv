The
recommended
way
is
using
Celery
.
If
you
want
don't
want
to
use
async
task
handling
you
can
also
just
create
a
custom
management
command
and
run
it
via
cron
.
Both
of
them
should
work
with
the
whole
projects
context
(
e.g
.
what
your
defined
in
your
settings
)
","
so
you
can
use
the
Django
ORM
to
connect
to
your
DB
etc..
