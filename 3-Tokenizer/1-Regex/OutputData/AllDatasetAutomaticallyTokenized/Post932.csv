If
you
can
use
argparse
(
i.e.
Python
2.7
+
)
","
it
has
built-in
support
for
what
you
want
:
straight
from
argparse
doc
The
FileType
factory
creates
objects
that
can
be
passed
to
the
type
argument
of
ArgumentParser.add_argument()
.
Arguments
that
have
FileType
objects
as
their
type
will
open
command-line
arguments
[
…
]
FileType
objects
understand
the
pseudo-argument
'
-
'
and
automatically
convert
this
into
sys.stdin
for
readable
FileType
objects
and
sys.stdout
for
writable
FileType
objects
.
So
my
advice
is
to
simply
use
Then
you
can
do
To
read
from
file
and
output
to
output
","
or
to
read
""""
Ni
!
""""
and
output
to
output
","
or
…
And
it's
good
","
since
using
-
for
the
relevant
stream
is
a
convention
that
a
lot
of
programs
use
.
If
you
want
to
point
it
out
","
add
it
to
the
help
strings
.
For
reference
","
the
usage
message
will
be
