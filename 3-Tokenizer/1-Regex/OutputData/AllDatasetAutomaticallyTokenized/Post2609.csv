Your
data
is
not
JSON-formatted
","
not
even
the
one
you
included
in
your
updated
answer
.
Your
data
is
a
JavaScript-object
","
not
an
encoded
string
.
Please
note
the
""""
N
""""
in
JSON
:
Notation
-
-
it
is
a
format
inspired
from
how
data
is
written
in
JavaScript
code
","
but
runtime
JavaScript
data
is
not
represented
in
JSON
.
The
""""
JSON
""""
you
pasted
is
how
your
browser
represents
the
object
to
you
","
it
is
not
proper
JSON
(
that
would
be
{
""""
ClientTypeId
""""
:
6
","
...
}
-
-
note
the
quotes
around
the
property
name
)
.
When
sending
this
data
to
the
server
","
you
have
to
encode
it
.
You
think
you
are
sending
it
JSON-encoded
","
but
you
aren't
.
You
are
sending
it
""""
web
form
encoded
""""
(
data
of
type
application
/
x-www-form-urlencoded
)
.
Now
either
you
have
to
learn
how
to
send
the
data
in
JSON
format
from
Angular
","
or
use
the
correct
parsing
routine
in
Python
:
urllib.parse.parse_qs
.
Depending
on
the
library
you
are
using
","
there
might
be
a
convenience
method
to
access
the
data
as
well
","
as
this
is
a
common
use
case
.
