This
way
fits
in
better
with
the
rest
of
the
language
.
The
convention
in
python
is
that
you
add
__foo__
special
methods
to
objects
to
make
them
have
certain
capabilities
(
rather
than
e.g
.
deriving
from
a
specific
base
class
)
.
For
example
","
an
object
is
callable
if
it
has
a
__call__
method
iterable
if
it
has
an
__iter__
method
","
supports
access
with
[]
if
it
has
__getitem__
and
__setitem__
.
...
One
of
these
special
methods
is
__len__
which
makes
it
have
a
length
accessible
with
len()
.
