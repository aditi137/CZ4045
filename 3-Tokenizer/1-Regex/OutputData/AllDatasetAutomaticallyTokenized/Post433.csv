I
personally
don't
agree
with
spaces
over
tabs
.
To
me
","
tabs
are
a
document
layout
character
/
mechanism
while
spaces
are
for
content
or
delineation
between
commands
in
the
case
of
code
.
I
have
to
agree
with
Jim's
comments
that
tabs
aren't
really
the
issue
","
it
is
people
and
how
they
want
to
mix
tabs
and
spaces
.
That
said
","
I've
forced
myself
to
use
spaces
for
the
sake
of
convention
.
I
value
consistency
over
personal
preference
.
