Creating
of
new
thead
is
very
expensive
operation
.
One
of
the
simplest
ways
for
controling
a
lot
of
paralell
network
connections
is
to
use
stackless
threads
with
support
of
asyncronical
sockets
.
Python
had
great
support
and
a
bunch
of
libraries
for
that
.
My
favorite
one
is
gevent
","
which
has
a
great
and
comletely
transparent
monkey-patching
utility
.
