When
assigning
with
a
pandas
object
","
pandas
treats
the
assignment
more
""""
rigorously
""""
.
A
pandas
to
pandas
assignment
must
pass
stricter
protocols
.
Only
when
you
turn
it
to
a
list
(
or
equivalently
"pd.Series([0, 1])"
.
values
)
did
pandas
give
in
and
allow
you
to
assign
in
the
way
you'd
imagine
it
should
work
.
That
higher
standard
of
assignment
requires
that
the
indices
line
up
as
well
","
so
even
if
you
had
the
right
shape
","
it
still
wouldn't
have
worked
without
the
correct
indices
.
