Question
:
instead
of
specifying
""""
names
""""
of
the
columns
using
Designinfo
(
which
basically
makes
my
code
less
re-usable
)
","
can
I
not
READ
the
names
given
by
this
DesignMatrix
so
that
I
can
feed
this
into
a
DataFrame
later
","
without
needing
to
know
pre-hand
what
the
""""
reference
level
/
control
group
""""
level
was
?
ie
.
When
I
do
"dmatrix(""C(carbs, Treatment(reference='lo')"
)
+
score
""""
","
dta
)
so
g
would
be
the
transformed
dataframe
I
can
do
logistic
modelling
on
without
needing
to
keep
a
note
of
(
or
hard-coding
thereof
)
of
the
column
names
&
their
reference
levels
.
