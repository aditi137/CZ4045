I
would
like
to
understand
how
to
reprint
multiple
lines
in
Python
3.5
.
This
is
an
example
of
a
script
where
I
would
like
to
refresh
the
printed
statement
in
place
.
What
I
am
trying
to
do
is
have
:
Write
on
top
of
/
update
/
refresh
:
The
values
of
each
line
will
change
each
time
.
This
is
effectively
giving
me
a
status
update
of
each
Line
.
I
saw
another
question
from
5
years
ago
however
with
the
addition
of
the
end
argument
in
Python
3
+
print
function
","
I
am
hoping
that
there
is
a
much
simpler
solution
.
