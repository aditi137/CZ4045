The
piece
that
seems
to
be
missing
from
the
docs
is
how
to
pass
the
API
key
.
Through
a
bit
of
testing
and
the
script
mentioned
above
","
I
found
the
X-API-Key
header
.
That
means
you
can
create
tickets
without
using
a
script
","
you
can
use
curl
as
easily
as
:
This
will
only
work
if
it
is
run
from
the
IP
address
you
specified
when
you
created
the
API
key
.
