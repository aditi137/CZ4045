Right
answer
:
They're
both
the
same
length
of
a
fraction
.
But
which
faster
if
subject
is
time
?
A
little
test
case
:
I
am
not
work
an
Swiss
labs
but
I've
tested
.
.
Based
of
this
question
:
time.clock()
is
better
than
time.time()
Edit
:
time.clock()
is
internal
counter
so
can't
use
outside
","
got
limitations
max
32BIT
FLOAT
","
can't
continued
counting
if
not
store
first
/
last
values
.
Can't
merge
another
one
counter
...
