I
am
having
a
problem
with
'
Maximum
recursion
depth
exceeded
'
in
python
I
converted
a
java(I dont know java so it wasn't easy)
function
to
python
function
and
it
did
work
for
small
lists
but
when
I
use
large
lists
I
get
that
error
.
I
tried
to
do
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
but
it
seem
that
there
is
a
problem
because
it
will
not
finish
","
maybe
because
I
converted
the
java
code
to
python
in
a
wrong
way
.
this
is
the
python
code
of
the
function
the
function
should
return
a
list
from
list
b
which
are
the
nearest
points
from
list
a
I
thought
that
convert
this
function
to
iterative
will
resolve
the
problem
.
my
question
is
","
how
to
make
that
function
100
%
iterative
instead
of
recursive
?
thanks
