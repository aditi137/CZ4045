I
downloaded
Kakadu
(
free
software
for
non
commercial
purposes
)
and
I
use
the
module
kdu_expand
.
os.system('kdu_expand -i image.jp2 -o temp_image.tif')
Slight
off-topic
comment
for
those
running
the
Kakadu
(
KDU
)
demo
.
Would
like
to
add
that
if
running
kdu_expand
","
like
above
:
os.system('kdu_expand -i image.jp2 -o temp_image.tif')
and
this
gives
you
an
error
:
Check
the
permissions
of
libkdu_v78R.dylib
and
change
them
to
644
or
666
","
or
something
with
read
/
write
access
.
