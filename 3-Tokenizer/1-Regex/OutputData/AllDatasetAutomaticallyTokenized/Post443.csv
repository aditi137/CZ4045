Because
this
page
is
a
top
result
for
Google
searches
on
the
topic
","
I
think
it's
worth
mentioning
some
work
that
has
been
done
on
URL
normalization
with
Python
that
goes
beyond
urlencoding
space
characters
.
For
example
","
dealing
with
default
ports
","
character
case
","
lack
of
trailing
slashes
","
etc.
When
the
Atom
syndication
format
was
being
developed
","
there
was
some
discussion
on
how
to
normalize
URLs
into
canonical
format
;
this
is
documented
in
the
article
PaceCanonicalIds
on
the
Atom
/
Pie
wiki
.
That
article
provides
some
good
test
cases
.
I
believe
that
one
result
of
this
discussion
was
Mark
Nottingham's
urlnorm.py
library
","
which
I've
used
with
good
results
on
a
couple
projects
.
That
script
doesn't
work
with
the
URL
given
in
this
question
","
however
.
So
a
better
choice
might
be
Sam
Ruby's
version
of
urlnorm.py
","
which
handles
that
URL
","
and
all
of
the
aforementioned
test
cases
from
the
Atom
wiki
.
