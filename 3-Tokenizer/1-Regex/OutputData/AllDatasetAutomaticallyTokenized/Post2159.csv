I
often
see
this
in
the
context
of
matplotlib
and
open-high-low-close
","
but
I'm
wondering
if
you
can
add
a
volume
overlay
within
the
pandas
framework
.
The
final
graph
we
would
want
would
be
close
to
the
first
one
here
:
(
Matplotlib
-
Finance
volume
overlay
)
Say
we
have
a
DataFrame
like
such
:
How
can
we
get
the
[
'
num
'
","
'
rolling_30
'
","
'
rolling_10
'
","
'
rolling_60
'
]
line
chart
with
the
bottom
of
the
chart
listing
the
daily
volume
?
I
can
do
a
secondary_y
to
get
volume
on
the
right
","
but
honestly
that
looks
terrible
.
Need
it
to
be
the
traditional
volume
bar-graph
at
the
bottom
of
the
chart
.
