I'm
+
-
in
the
same
case
as
you
.
I
will
explain
my
solution
.
I'm
not
opening
the
pdfs
with
"PdfFileReader('filename.pdf', 'rb')"
but
I'm
passing
the
pdfs
content
in
an
array
for
the
merge
(
pdfs_content_array
)
.
Then
I'm
preparing
the
merger
and
my
output
(
don't
want
to
save
the
generated
file
locally
so
I
have
to
use
BytesIO
to
save
the
merged
content
somewhere
)
calc_page_sum
is
needed
to
compare
the
page
number
results
.
The
most
important
part
is
:
calc_page_sum
+
=
PdfFileReader(bytes_content)
.
getNumPages()
so
I
open
the
bytes
content
with
PdfFileReader
and
get
the
pages
number
.
Then
I'm
appending
the
merger
...
merger.append
","
bytes_content
I'm
writing
the
merge
into
my
bytes
output
and
compare
it
with
the
calc_page_sum
.
That's
it
.
Hope
this
will
help
!
