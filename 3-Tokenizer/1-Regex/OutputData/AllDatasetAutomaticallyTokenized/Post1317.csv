What
is
probably
happening
is
that
the
Web
site
is
loading
the
additional
data
through
JavaScript
and
/
or
XMLHttpRequest
or
through
CSS
.
Firebug
shows
you
the
DOM
once
it
has
been
completed
.
With
a
Webdriver
you
can
pilot
the
browser
in
loading
a
page
and
interact
with
it
.
The
issue
comes
when
some
of
the
additional
information
is
given
once
there
is
a
specific
user
interaction
.
So
a
way
to
mitigate
this
would
be
to
use
webdriver
to
pilot
the
browser
and
do
the
same
sequence
of
actions
so
that
the
DOM
will
change
accordingly
.
You
might
want
to
play
with
the
CSS
to
change
the
properties
and
make
the
element
visible
too
.
Given
that
you
didn't
provide
any
code
examples
of
what
you
are
trying
to
do
","
it
is
not
realistic
to
precisely
help
you
.
But
you
will
find
plenty
of
webdriver
code
examples
in
python
in
the
official
documentation
.
