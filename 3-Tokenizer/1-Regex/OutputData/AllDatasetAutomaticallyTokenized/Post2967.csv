I
have
some
standard
boiler
plate
code
to
draw
a
simple
bar
graph
with
a
""""
count
""""
label
on
top
of
each
bar
.
I
am
live
updating
this
bar
graph
as
the
data
changes
.
I
am
able
to
successfully
live
update
the
graph
.
Here
is
the
code
:
which
as
you
can
see
is
standard
boiler
plate
code
.
In
my
main
I
do
:
get_updated_data
will
just
pull
new
data
and
call
the
code
to
generate
the
graph
.
This
is
correctly
updating
the
bars
.
However
","
the
labels
added
above
each
bar
aren't
overwritten
.
They
get
""""
stacked
""""
above
each
other
each
time
the
graph
is
refreshed
.
Whats
the
appropriate
way
to
fix
this
?
I
have
tried
fig.canvas.draw()
but
it
is
not
working
.
Maybe
I
am
adding
it
in
the
wrong
place
.
Whats
the
right
approach
?
Thanks
