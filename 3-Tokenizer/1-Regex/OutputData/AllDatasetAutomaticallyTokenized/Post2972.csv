I
am
learning
powershell
and
trying
to
start
a
python
service
using
the
powershell
IDE
.
I
came
to
know
I
can
start
the
python
services
either
by
one
of
these
commands
.
Though
both
of
these
gives
the
same
result
","
I
am
curious
to
know
what
is
the
difference
between
these
two
in
terms
of
internal
functions
and
which
is
better
to
use
?
