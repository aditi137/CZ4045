So
I
have
managed
to
now
successfully
write
a
python
script
that
will
:
Read
a
CSV
file
of
coordinates
written
as
such
:
Then
using
this
:
Display
this
:
Now
I
am
able
to
write
a
CSV
file
and
output
it
but
I
am
unsure
how
to
then
write
a
new
output
CSV
file
","
or
even
just
display
it
as
a
list
in
the
shell
","
so
that
it
would
display
as
.
I've
been
reading
other
questions
/
answers
but
can't
find
anything
to
append
a
new
column
using
a
true
or
false
value
from
within
the
script
.
