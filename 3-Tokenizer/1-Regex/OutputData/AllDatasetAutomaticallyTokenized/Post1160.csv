I
think
you're
misunderstanding
the
way
celery
works
.
You
can't
just
replace
its
broker
with
a
MySQL
table
of
your
own
design
-
well
","
not
without
making
substantial
changes
to
its
source
code
.
The
broker
is
an
internal
part
of
celery
which
it
uses
to
keep
track
of
its
tasks
","
using
its
own
internal
format
","
so
there's
no
inherent
advantage
to
using
a
MySQL
broker
solely
because
that's
the
way
in
which
you
currently
store
the
information
necessary
to
perform
your
tasks
.
You
can
still
use
celery
if
you
like
","
but
you'd
have
to
write
the
code
necessary
to
translate
your
user
activity
table
into
celery
tasks
.
However
","
I'd
recommend
experimenting
with
celery
first
to
...
get
a
basic
understanding
of
how
to
use
it
determine
if
it's
a
good
solution
for
what
you're
trying
to
achieve
Start
off
with
the
celery
tutorial
","
and
see
how
it
goes
from
there
.
