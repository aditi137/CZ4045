I
need
some
help
mapping
views
in
Django
.
My
app
is
pretty
simple
-
-
it's
just
a
status
page
listing
all
of
our
environments
and
their
corresponding
apps
.
So
far
I
have
all
the
env's
listed
like
so
:
But
what
I
want
is
:
(
where
[
app
*
]
would
be
from
app_list
in
my
Environment
class
-
-
see
below
)
Here's
my
models.py
(
app_list
=
app1
","
app2
","
etc.
)
-

UPDATE

And
my
views.py

my
index.html
