What
are
some
useful
methods
or
libraries
that
can
be
used
to
track
IP
request
from
a
personal
computer
.
Ideally
I
would
like
the
option
to
block
or
pause
a
specific
outgoing
request
before
/
after
some
checks
are
carried
out
.
I've
seen
Twisted
","
but
I'm
not
sure
if
its
exactly
what
I'm
looking
for
just
yet
","
or
if
there
exist
simpler
methods
for
doing
this
.
I'm
not
looking
for
a
standalone
application
as
there
are
other
features
that
will
be
build
around
this
for
a
specific
purpose
.
Language
:
Preferably
in
Python
","
but
C
/
C
+
+
are
possible
options
as
well
.
OS
:
The
current
target
is
Linux
(
ubuntu
)
.
However
cross-platform
options
would
be
best
.
