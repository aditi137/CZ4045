I
wonder
why
would
a
C
+
+
","
C
#
","
Java
developer
want
to
learn
a
dynamic
language
?
Assuming
the
company
won't
switch
its
main
development
language
from
C
+
+
/
C
#
/
Java
to
a
dynamic
one
what
use
is
there
for
a
dynamic
language
?
What
helper
tasks
can
be
done
by
the
dynamic
languages
faster
or
better
after
only
a
few
days
of
learning
than
with
the
static
language
that
you
have
been
using
for
several
years
?
Update
After
seeing
the
first
few
responses
it
is
clear
that
there
are
two
issues
.
My
main
interest
would
be
something
that
is
justifiable
to
the
employer
as
an
expense
.
That
is
","
I
am
looking
for
justifications
for
the
employer
to
finance
the
learning
of
a
dynamic
language
.
Aside
from
the
obvious
that
the
employee
will
have
broader
view
","
the
employers
are
usually
looking
for
some
""""
real
""""
benefit
.
