I
am
trying
to
make
a
link
in
the
sidebar
of
my
Person
model
as
persons
.
For
that
I
made
a
templatetags
folder
where
my
member_template_tags.py
:
and
my
view
file
:
my
person_list.html
:
and
in
base.html
","
sidebar
code
is
:
When
I
tried
it
gives
following
traceback
:
Template
error
:
Exception
Type
:
NoReverseMatch
at
/
person
/
Edit
:
When
I
use
The
same
code
gives
'
get_person_list
'
received
too
many
positional
arguments
errors
.
The
new
traceback
:
How
do
I
fix
this
error
and
make
link
in
the
sidebar
so
that
it
gives
the
full
view
of
person_list
template
?
Any
help
will
be
much
appreciated
.
