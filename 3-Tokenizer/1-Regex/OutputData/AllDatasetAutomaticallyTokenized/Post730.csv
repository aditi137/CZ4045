I
am
working
in
an
application
which
(
among
other
things
)
need
to
read
a
satellite
image
(
with
only
one
band
per
image
)
and
process
the
pixel
data
.
The
format
is
JPEG-2000
and
therefore
I
cannot
use
the
PIL
library
(
which
simplifies
everything
)
.
I
have
found
the
PythonMagick
library
and
I
can
perfectly
read
the
image
and
extract
the
value
of
the
pixel
.
But
only
for
one
pixel
!
Therefore
","
I
need
a
for-loop
to
get
all
the
pixel
values
(
the
images
are
very
large
)
.
I
tried
with
Blob
function
to
get
the
data
but
it
crashes
.
Are
there
any
better
options
?
How
could
I
quickly
get
the
pixel
data
of
a
JPEG2000
image
and
save
it
into
an
array
?
