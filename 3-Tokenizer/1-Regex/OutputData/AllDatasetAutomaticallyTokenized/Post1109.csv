I
have
the
following
function
that
takes
3
pieces
of
information
(
name
","
age
","
hometown
)
for
3
people
and
saves
it
in
a
txt
file
.
I
am
now
trying
to
create
a
function
that
will
read
the
text
file
and
print
a
persons
name
if
their
hometown
is
'
Oxford
'
.
So
far
I
have
the
following
just
to
read
the
text
from
the
file
but
im
not
sure
how
to
skip
back
a
line
and
print
the
name
if
the
town
is
Oxford
.
Thanks
for
any
help
!
