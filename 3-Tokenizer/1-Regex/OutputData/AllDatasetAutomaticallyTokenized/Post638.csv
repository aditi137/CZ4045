Are
there
any
Python
solutions
out
in
the
web
for
satellite
/
radar
/
lidar
/
aircraft
based
2D
/
3D
visualization
of
atmospheric
measurements
.
My
interest
range
vary
from
simply
overlaying
flight
tracks
over
satellite
images
/
data
to
co-located
visualizations
of
lidar
/
radar
/
aircraft
measurements
(
within
themselves
)
and
with
matching
satellite
pixels
.
I
would
be
happy
to
know
if
such
visualization
attempts
(
tools
or
custom
Python
scripts
)
exist
before
I
start
working
on
my
own
solutions
.
Thank
you
.
