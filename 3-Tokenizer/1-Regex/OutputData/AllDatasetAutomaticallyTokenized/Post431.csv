The
answer
was
given
right
there
in
the
PEP
[
ed
:
this
passage
has
been
edited
out
in
2013
]
.
I
quote
:
The
most
popular
way
of
indenting
Python
is
with
spaces
only
.
What
other
underlying
reason
do
you
need
?
To
put
it
less
bluntly
:
Consider
also
the
scope
of
the
PEP
as
stated
in
the
very
first
paragraph
:
This
document
gives
coding
conventions
for
the
Python
code
comprising
the
standard
library
in
the
main
Python
distribution
.
The
intention
is
to
make
all
code
that
goes
in
the
official
python
distribution
consistently
formatted
(
I
hope
we
can
agree
that
this
is
universally
a
Good
Thingâ
„
¢
)
.
Since
the
decision
between
spaces
and
tabs
for
an
individual
programmer
is
a
)
really
a
matter
of
taste
and
b
)
easily
dealt
with
by
technical
means
(
editors
","
conversion
scripts
","
etc.
)
","
there
is
a
clear
way
to
end
all
discussion
:
choose
one
.
Guido
was
the
one
to
choose
.
He
didn't
even
have
to
give
a
reason
","
but
he
still
did
by
referring
to
empirical
data
.
For
all
other
purposes
you
can
either
take
this
PEP
as
a
recommendation
","
or
you
can
ignore
it
-
-
your
choice
","
or
your
team's
","
or
your
team
leaders
.
But
if
I
may
give
you
one
advice
:
don't
mix'em
;
-
)
[
ed
:
Mixing
tabs
and
spaces
is
no
longer
an
option
.
