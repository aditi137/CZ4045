If
you
want
to
remove
all
tuples
containing
the
number
x
from
the
list
of
combinations
"itertools.combinations(l, 2)"
","
consider
that
you
there
is
a
one-to-one
mapping
(
mathematically
speaking
)
from
the
set
"itertools.combinations([i for i in range(1,len(l)"
]
","
2
)
to
the
"itertools.combinations(l, 2)"
that
don't
contain
the
number
x
.
Example
:
The
set
of
all
of
combinations
from
"itertools.combinations([1,2,3,4], 2)"
that
don't
contain
the
number
1
is
given
by
[
(
2
","
3
)
","
(
2
","
4
)
","
(
3
","
4
)
]
.
Notice
that
the
number
of
elements
in
this
list
is
equal
to
the
number
of
elements
of
combinations
in
the
list
"itertools.combinations([1,2,3], 2)"
=
[
(
1
","
2
)
","
(
1
","
3
)
","
(
2
","
3
)
]
.
Since
order
doesn't
matter
in
combinations
","
you
can
map
1
to
4
in
[
(
1
","
2
)
","
(
1
","
3
)
","
(
2
","
3
)
]
to
get
[
(
1
","
2
)
","
(
1
","
3
)
","
(
2
","
3
)
]
=
[
