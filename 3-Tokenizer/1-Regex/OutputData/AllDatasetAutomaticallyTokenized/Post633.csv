According
to
what
we
can
see
in
Wikipedia
and
w3
school
","
you
should
not
have
'
and
""""
in
nodes
content
","
even
if
only
<
and
&
are
said
to
be
stricly
illegal
.
They
should
be
replaced
by
corresponding
""""
predefined
entity
references
""""
","
that
are
&apos
;
and
&quot
;
.
By
the
way
","
the
Python
parsers
I
use
will
take
care
of
this
transparently
:
when
writing
","
they
are
replaced
;
when
reading
","
they
are
converted
.
After
a
second
reading
of
your
answer
","
I
tested
some
stuff
with
the
'
and
so
on
in
Python
interpreter
.
And
it
will
escape
everything
for
you
!
So
we
can
see
that
Python
escapes
things
correctly
.
Could
you
then
copy-paste
the
error
message
you
get
(
if
any
)
?
