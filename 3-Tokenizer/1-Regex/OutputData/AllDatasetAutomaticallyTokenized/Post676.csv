If
the
module
is
specific
to
your
program
","
you
can
put
into
the
same
directory
as
the
main
script
.
From
the
documentation
:
When
a
module
named
spam
is
imported
","
the
interpreter
searches
for
a
file
named
spam.py
in
the
directory
containing
the
input
script
and
then
in
the
list
of
directories
specified
by
the
environment
variable
PYTHONPATH
.
I
would
recommend
that
you
read
the
entire
tutorial
on
modules
.
It's
pretty
short
and
has
a
lot
of
useful
info
.
