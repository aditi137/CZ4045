I
have
the
following
problem
:
I
have
a
defaultdict
called
word_count
containing
words
and
the
number
how
often
they
occur
.
I
get
this
by
counting
the
reply
of
the
Google
Speech
API
.
However
","
this
API
gives
me
back
things
like
'
\
303\266
'
for
the
German
letter
'
รถ
'
.
Now
I
want
to
go
through
this
dict
","
test
if
one
of
these
things
shown
above
is
there
and
replace
it
with
the
right
thing
like
this
:
Filling
the
defaultdict
:
So
far
it
works
fine
","
I
can
print
the
dict
and
it
gets
me
the
words
with
the
number
.
Now
replacing
the
key
:
Now
this
does
not
work
","
I
guess
because
I
cannot
pop(key)
as
it
expects
an
integer
.
How
else
would
I
do
this
?
I
tried
several
approaches
","
but
nothing
seems
to
work
here
.
Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
!
Solution
:
Turns
out
this
was
my
fault
","
as
I
sorted
the
dict
and
thereby
turned
it
to
a
list
of
tuples
.
Thanks
to
everyone
who
helped
me
figure
this
out
!
