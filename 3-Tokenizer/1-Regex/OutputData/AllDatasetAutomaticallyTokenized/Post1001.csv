I'm
trying
to
increment
all
timestamps
(
of
the
form
'
HH:MM:SS
'
)
in
a
text
file
by
a
number
of
seconds
specified
by
a
command-line
parameter
to
my
program
.
Here's
a
simplified
version
of
my
effort
so
far
:
This
works
fine
:
the
result
of
running
this
is
01:28:05
which
is
just
what
I
want
.
However
","
I've
heard
that
I
should
use
global
variables
as
less
as
possible
.
So
I
was
wondering
if
there's
a
simple
way
to
pass
time_diff
as
an
argument
to
replace_time
instead
of
using
a
global
variable
.
I
tried
the
obvious
","
but
it
failed
:
with
this
error
:
NameError
:
name
'
matchobj
'
is
not
defined
","
so
I
can't
pass
matchobj
directly
.
I've
looked
at
the
standard
re
page
and
standard
re
howto
","
but
can't
find
the
information
I
need
over
there
.
How
can
I
avoid
using
a
global
variable
here
?
Can
I
somehow
pass
an
extra
argument
to
the
replace_time
function
?
Thanks
in
advance
.
