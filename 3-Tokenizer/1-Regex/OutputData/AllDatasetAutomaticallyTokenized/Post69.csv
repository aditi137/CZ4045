This
document
seems
to
go
into
quite
a
bit
of
detail
(
and
I
think
a
complete
description
is
out
of
scope
for
a
stackoverflow
answer
)
:

The
general
idea
of
translating
from
one
language
to
another
isn't
particularly
revolutionary
","
but
it
has
only
recently
been
gaining
popularity
/
applicability
in
""""
real-world
""""
applications
.
GWT
does
this
with
Java
(
generating
Javascript
)
and
there
is
a
library
for
translating
Haskell
into
various
other
languages
as
well
(
called
YHC
)
