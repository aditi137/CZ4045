I
am
trying
to
send
images
from
a
Java
client
to
a
Python
server
using
gRPC
and
ProtoBuf
.
I
encode
the
image
as
a
ByteString
and
send
it
with
a
blockingStub
.
The
Python
server
receives
the
ProtoBuf
","
but
the
Java
ByteString
is
now
a
Python
str
.
I'm
not
sure
how
to
restore
the
image
from
the
str
.
When
I
call
in
the
server
:
it
raises
:
Traceback
(
most
recent
call
last
)
:
