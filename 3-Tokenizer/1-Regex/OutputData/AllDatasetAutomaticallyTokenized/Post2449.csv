After
your
Dialog
is
closed
","
and
the
popup
variable
referencing
it
goes
out
of
scope
","
Python
will
garbage-collect
it
.
This
causes
the
entire
underlying
C
+
+
object
","
including
all
of
its
sub-widgets
and
layouts
","
to
be
deleted
.
However
","
you're
keeping
a
reference
to
a
layout
used
by
the
dialog
","
and
hence
the
layout
will
have
been
deleted
by
the
second
time
you
try
to
open
the
dialog
.
I
find
it
odd
that
you're
doing
all
of
the
initialization
of
your
Dialog
class
outside
of
the
Dialog
class
.
Instead
","
I
would
recommend
moving
the
creation
of
popLayout
","
and
all
of
the
creation
and
setup
of
table
","
inside
your
Dialog
class
.
This
way
the
layout
gets
created
each
time
the
dialog
is
opened
.
You'll
need
to
add
gameResults
as
a
parameter
to
the
__init__
method
of
Dialog
","
and
you
can
also
remove
the
layout
parameter
you
have
there
at
the
moment
because
it
isn't
used
.
After
doing
this
","
your
Dialog
class
should
look
like
the
following
:
and
your
doStuff()
method
should
look
like
the
following
:
I
made
these
changes
to
your
code
and
I
was
able
to
open
the
dialog
multiple
times
.
I'll
leave
it
up
to
you
to
move
your
main
window
set-up
code
inside
your
Window
class
in
the
same
way
.
Finally
","
please
note
that
I
have
only
tested
this
using
PyQt
.
However
","
I
would
expect
that
my
changes
would
also
work
for
PySide
.
