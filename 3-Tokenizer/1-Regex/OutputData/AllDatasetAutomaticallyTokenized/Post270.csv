I
primarily
program
in
Java
and
C
#
but
use
dynamic
languages
(
ruby
/
perl
)
to
support
smoother
deployment
","
kicking
off
OS
tasks
","
automated
reporting
","
some
log
parsing
","
etc.
After
a
short
time
learning
and
experimenting
with
ruby
or
perl
you
should
be
able
to
write
some
regex
manipulating
scripts
that
can
alter
data
formats
or
grab
information
from
logs
.
An
example
of
a
small
ruby
/
perl
script
that
could
be
written
quickly
would
be
a
script
to
parse
a
very
large
log
file
and
report
out
only
a
few
events
of
interest
in
either
a
human
readable
format
or
a
csv
format
.
Also
","
having
experience
with
a
variety
of
different
programming
languages
should
help
you
think
of
new
ways
to
tackle
problems
in
more
structured
languages
like
Java
","
C
+
+
","
and
