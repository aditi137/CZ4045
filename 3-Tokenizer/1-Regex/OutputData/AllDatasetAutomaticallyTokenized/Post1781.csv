Turtle
uses
Tkinter
canvas
","
which
you
can
get
using
turtle.getcanvas()
","
and
according
to
this
you
cannot
read
the
colour
of
a
pixel
without
using
a
workaround
of
converting
the
canvas
to
a
picture
(
bitmap
)
and
read
the
bitmap
.
You
could
try
to
keep
an
open
array
to
work
as
the
bitmap
of
your
canvas
and
update
it
yourself
as
you
draw
new
elements
on
the
canvas
","
although
that
seems
impractical
unless
the
maze
is
simple
and
'
squary
'
.
