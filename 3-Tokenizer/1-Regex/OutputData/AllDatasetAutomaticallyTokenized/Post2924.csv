You
have
a
contingency
table
.
To
perform
the
Ï‡2
test
on
this
data
","
you
can
use
scipy.stats.chi2_contingency
:
Your
contingency
table
is
2x2
","
so
you
can
use
Fisher's
exact
test
.
This
is
implemented
in
scipy
as
scipy.stats.fisher_exact
:
scipy
doesn't
have
much
more
for
contingency
tables
.
It
looks
like
the
next
release
of
statsmodels
will
have
more
tools
for
the
analysis
of
contingency
tables
","
but
that
doesn't
help
right
now
.
It
isn't
hard
to
write
some
code
to
compute
the
difference
in
proportion
and
its
95
%
confidence
interval
.
Here's
one
way
:
For
example
","
The
first
value
returned
is
the
difference
in
proportions
delta
.
The
next
two
pairs
are
the
Wald
95
%
confidence
interval
for
delta
","
and
the
Wald
95
%
confidence
interval
with
Yates
continuity
correction
.
If
you
don't
like
those
negative
values
","
you
can
reverse
the
rows
first
:
For
comparison
","
here
is
a
similar
calculation
in
R
:
