Oakley
is
correct
","
the
image
is
not
a
jpg
in
terms
of
its
content
","
even
though
your
filesystem
thinks
it's
a
gif
.
On
my
end
I
tried
opening
a
jpg
with
your
program
and
got
the
same
error
'
TclError
:
couldn't
recognize
data
in
image
file
""""
hello.jpg
""""
.
'
So
you
can
do
this
:
Open
your
image
with
mspaint
","
then
go
to
File
>
Save
As
and
from
the
""""
Save
As
Type
""""
dropdown
","
choose
GIF
.
Then
the
code
should
work
.
This
is
what
I
used
:
(
btw
","
if
I
changed
line
7
above
to
photo
=
PhotoImage(imgPath)
then
like
you
","
no
image
appears
.
So
leave
it
as
photo
=
PhotoImage(file = imgPath)
)
