I
am
creating
a
program
that
loads
and
runs
python
scripts
from
a
compressed
file
.
Along
with
those
python
scripts
","
I
have
a
config
file
that
I
previously
used
configparser
to
load
info
from
in
an
uncompressed
version
of
the
program
.
Is
it
possible
to
directly
read
config
files
in
zip
files
directly
with
configparser
?
or
do
I
have
to
unzip
it
into
a
temp
folder
and
load
it
from
there
?
I
have
tried
directly
giving
the
path
:
Didn't
work
.
no
surprises
there
.
Then
I
tried
using
zipfile
and
found
that
it
didn't
work
either
.
so
I've
resorted
to
creating
a
temp
folder
","
uncompressing
to
it
","
and
reading
the
conf
file
there
.
I
would
really
like
to
avoid
this
if
possible
as
the
conf
files
are
the
only
limiting
factor
.
I
can
(
and
am
)
loading
the
python
modules
from
the
zip
file
just
fine
at
this
point
.
I
can
get
the
raw
text
of
the
file
if
there's
a
way
to
pass
that
directly
to
configparser
","
but
searching
the
docs
I
came
up
empty
handed
.
Update
:
I
tried
using
stringIO
as
a
file
object
","
and
it
seems
to
work
somewhat
.
configparser
doesn't
reject
it
","
but
it
doesn't
like
it
either
.
If
I
use
read_file
instead
","
it
doesn't
error
out
","
but
doesn't
load
anything
either
.
