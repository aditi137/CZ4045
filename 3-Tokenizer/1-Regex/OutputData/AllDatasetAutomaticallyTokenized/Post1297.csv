First
of
all
","
you
are
storing
the
return

is
always
None
","
instead
of
the
reference
to
the
widgets

Besides
","
you
shouldn't
use
both
geometry
managers

same

you
are
new
to
Tkinter

I'd
suggest
grid
instead
of
pack
)
.
To
update
the
text
of
the
widget
","
you
have
to
use
config
with
the
text
keyword
or
budget
