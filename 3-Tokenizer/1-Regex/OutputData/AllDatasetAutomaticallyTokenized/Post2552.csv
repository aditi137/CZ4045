I'm
using
sphinx-autodoc-annotation
to
read
the
function
annotations
in
my
Python
code
and
use
that
to
generate
the
appropriate
expected
argument
types
and
return
types
.
It's
working
great
on
my
local
machine
","
but
I
had
to
pip
install
sphinx-autodoc-annotation
of
course
.
I'm
trying
to
generate
the
same
documentation
using
Read
the
Docs
","
but
it
gives
me
an
error
:
Is
it
possible
to
configure
Read
the
Docs
to
work
with
sphinx-autodoc-annotation
","
and
if
so
","
how
do
I
make
it
work
?
