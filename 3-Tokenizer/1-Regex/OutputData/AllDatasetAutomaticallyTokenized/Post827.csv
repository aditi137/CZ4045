Hi
guys
:
Is
there
a
way
to
improve
trac
wiki
quality
using
a
plugin
that
deals
with
artifacts
like
for
obsolete
pages
","
or
pages
that
refer
to
code
which
doesn't
exist
anymore
","
pages
that
are
unlinked
","
or
pages
which
have
a
low
update-rate
?
I
think
there
might
be
several
heuristics
which
could
be
used
to
prevent
wiki-rot
:
Number
of
recent
edits
Number
of
recent
views
Wether
or
not
a
page
links
to
a
source
file
Wether
or
not
a
wiki
page's
last
update
is
<
or
>
the
source
files
it
links
to
Wether
entire
directories
in
the
wiki
have
been
used
/
edited
/
ignored
over
the
last
""""
n
""""
days
etc.
etc.
etc.
If
nothing
else
","
just
these
metrics
alone
would
be
useful
for
each
page
and
each
directory
from
an
administrative
standpoint
.
