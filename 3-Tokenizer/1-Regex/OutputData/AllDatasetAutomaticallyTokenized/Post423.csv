The
problem
with
tabs
is
that
they
are
invisible
","
and
people
can
never
agree
on
the
width
of
tabs
.
When
you
mix
tabs
and
spaces
","
and
you
set
tabstops
at
something
other
than
Python
(
which
uses
tabstops
every
8
spaces
)
you
will
be
seeing
the
code
in
a
different
layout
than
Python
sees
it
.
And
because
the
layout
determines
blocks
","
you
will
be
seeing
different
logic
.
It
leads
to
subtle
bugs
.
If
you
insist
on
defying
PEP
8
and
using
tabs
-
-
or
worse
","
mixing
tabs
and
spaces
-
-
at
least
always
run
python
with
the
'
-
tt
'
argument
","
which
makes
inconsistent
indentation
(
sometimes
a
tab
","
sometimes
a
space
for
the
same
indentation
level
)
an
error
.
Also
","
if
possible
","
set
your
editor
to
display
tabs
differently
.
But
really
","
the
best
approach
is
not
to
use
tabs
","
period
.
