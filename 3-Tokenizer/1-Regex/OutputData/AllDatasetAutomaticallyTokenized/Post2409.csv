I've
looked
through
some
of
the
other
posts
on
this
and
I
hope
I'm
not
duplicating
","
but
I'm
stuck
on
a
real
headscratcher
with
setting
a
proxy
server
for
urllib2
.
I'm
running
the
below
:
I'm
running
this
against
an
IP
info
site
","
but
try
as
I
might
the
response
always
comes
out
with
my
non-proxy
IP
address
.
When
I
manually
set
my
proxy
through
system
settings
I
do
get
a
different
response
","
so
I've
confirmed
it's
not
an
issue
with
the
proxy
criteria
itself
.
Any
help
that
could
be
offered
would
be
much
appreciated
!
