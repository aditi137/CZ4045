I
have
some
data
in
a
PostgreSQL
table
.
I
am
pulling
the
data
back
to
a
notebook
via
code
like
the
following
:
In
the
PostgreSQL
table
all
columns
were
typed
accurately
but
result_df
is
as
follows
:
Converting
the
date
column
was
fine
:
As
was
ensuring
all
None
values
are
now
NaN
values
:
But
to
convert
the
columns
score
&
cost
to
numeric
I
need
to
execute
the
following
3
lines
of
code
:
If
I
use
only
lines
1
and
2
then
the
typing
is
still
object
-
if
I
use
only
lines
1
and
3
then
all
the
data
is
converted
to
NaN
as
if
all
the
data
has
not
coerced
.
Why
do
I
have
to
use
this
code
and
is
there
a
more
elegant
solution
?
