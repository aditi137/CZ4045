In
your
REST_FRAMEWORK
settings
you
haven't
mentioned
the
Authentication
scheme
so
DRF
uses
the
default
authentication
scheme
which
is
SessionAuthentication
.
This
scheme
makes
it
mandatory
for
you
to
put
csrf
token
with
your
requests
.
You
can
overcome
this
by
:
To
make
this
setting
for
the
whole
project
in
settings.py
add
To
make
this
setting
in
specific
view
do
the
following
in
your
view
source
:
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#sessionauthentication
BTW
","
csrf
token
is
saved
as
a
cookie
called
'
csrftoken
'
.
You
can
retrieve
it
from
HTTP
Response
and
attach
it
to
your
request
header
with
the
key
'
X-CSRFToken
'
.
You
can
see
some
details
of
this
on
