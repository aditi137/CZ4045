I
have
a
2D
array
","
a
","
comprising
a
set
of
100
x
","
y
","
z
coordinates
:
I
would
like
to
create
a
3D
binary
image
","
b
","
with
101
pixels
in
each
of
the
x
","
y
","
z
dimensions
","
of
coordinates
ranging
between
0.00
and
1.00
.
Pixels
at
locations
defined
by
a
should
take
on
a
value
of
1
","
all
other
pixels
should
have
a
value
of
0
.
I
can
create
an
array
of
zeros
of
the
right
shape
with
b
=
"np.zeros((101,101,101)"
)
","
but
how
do
I
assign
coordinate
and
slice
into
it
to
create
the
ones
using
a
?
