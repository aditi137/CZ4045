Your
loop
should
work
if
you
don't
cast
to
a
list
","
and
if
you
do
the
assignment
like
:
In
your
first
attempt
","
np.array
is
just
doing
its
job
.
It
sees
a
nested
collection
of
data
that
can
be
converted
to
a
3-D
array
","
so
it
does
so
.
To
get
a
2-D
array
of
objects
","
you
can
change
this
:
to
this
:
Here's
a
concrete
example
:
I
don't
have
your
Vector
class
","
so
I'll
just
use
numpy
arrays
as
the
objects
that
I
want
in
the
array
of
objects
.
Here's
the
data
that
I
want
to
put
into
an
array
of
objects
.
It
is
a
nested
list
of
numpy
arrays
","
each
with
two
elements
:
You
could
change
"np.array([10*j + k, 10*j + k + 1])"
to
"Vector(10*j + k, 10*j + k + 1)"
to
try
this
with
your
Vector
class
.
a
is
the
array
of
objects
that
I'm
creating
:
Assign
the
vectors
to
a
like
this
:
