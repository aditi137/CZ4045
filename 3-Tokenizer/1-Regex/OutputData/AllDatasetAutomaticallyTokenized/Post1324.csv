I
am
using
SimPy
","
and
I
try
to
simulate
a
network
.
This
is
my
main
module
:
I
want
an
object
of
class
message
","
which
is
activated
by
an
object
of
class
node
","
to
interrrupt
an
object
of
class
Network
(
topology
)
.
But
I'm
getting
an
error
:
And
I
don't
know
how
to
make
an
object
global
.
And
if
I
type
topology
in
python
shell
then
it
shows
me
object
topology
","
so
why
can't
message
see
it
?
