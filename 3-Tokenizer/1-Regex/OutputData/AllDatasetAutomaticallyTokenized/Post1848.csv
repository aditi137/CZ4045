The
way
I
approached
such
scenario
(
in
a
python-only
project
","
donno
about
php
)
was
to
use
a
custom
handler
(
inheriting
webapp2.RequestHandler
which
I
was
already
using
for
session
support
)
.
In
its
customized
dispatch()
method
the
user
info
is
collected
and
stored
in
the
handler
object
itself
.
The
implementation
of
the
handler
exists
in
only
one
version
controlled
file
","
but
which
is
symlinked
(
for
GAE
accessibility
)
in
each
module
that
references
the
handler
.
This
way
I
don't
have
to
manage
multiple
independent
copies
of
the
user
and
session
verification
code
.
