Initially
I
was
not
using
the
unittest
framework
","
so
to
test
that
two
objects
of
the
same
class
are
not
comparable
using
the
operators
<
and
>
=
I
did
something
like
:
after
that
","
though
","
I
decided
to
start
using
the
unittest
module
","
so
I'm
converting
my
tests
to
the
way
tests
are
written
with
the
same
module
.
I
was
trying
to
accomplish
the
equivalent
thing
as
above
with
:
but
this
does
not
quite
work
","
because
o1
<
o2
tries
to
call
the
operator
<
","
instead
of
being
a
reference
to
a
function
","
which
should
be
called
as
part
of
the
test
.
Is
there
a
way
to
accomplish
what
I
need
without
needing
to
wrap
o1
<
o2
in
a
function
?
