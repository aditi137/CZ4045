Assume
I
have
a
series
of
classes
as
follows
:
If
now
D
is
a
both
B
and
C
","
it
can
be
implemented
as
Or
D
can
be
understood
as
a
combination
of
B
and
C
which
seems
a
bit
more
complicated
than
the
multi-inheritance
case
.
Well
","
Now
let's
imaging
class
D2
is
a
combination
of
5
pieces
of
B
and
3
pieces
of
C
","
and
class
D3
is
made
of
D2
plus
an
additional
C(with different parameter than the ones in D)
","
and
D4
is
made
of
D2
and
2
additional
pieces
of
C(these 2 additional C has same parameter but different from the ones in D2)
.
It
seems
D2
is
good
to
use
composition
","
but
D3
is
good
to
use
inheritance
of
D2
and
C
","
and
D4
is
good
to
use
inheritance
of
D2
and
C
.
Use
combinations
","
to
me
","
has
the
disadvantage
that
I
have
to
write
d.c.c1
rather
than
d.c1(as in inheritance case)
to
get
the
parameter
c
or
I
need
to
store
the
parameter
c
in
D
directly(besides the one as d.c.c1)
.
Is
there
any
philosophical
consistent
way
to
deal
with
these
classes
?
Thanks
!
