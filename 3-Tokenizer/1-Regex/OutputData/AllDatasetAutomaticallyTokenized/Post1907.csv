a
nutshell
","
floating
point
can't
really
represent
0.05

effect
is
minute

The
correct
solution
is
to
define
the
desired
precision
for
each

accordingly
when
necessary
.
In
your
case
","
you
can
round
to
5
digits
since
you're
only
adding
a
few
numbers
.
But
for
more
complex
calculations
which
need
to
be
correct
","
you
will
have
to
do
the
error
assessment
.
