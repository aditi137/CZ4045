I
have
a
very
effective
method
to
save
the
notebooks
in
a
desired
location
in
windows
.
One-off
activity
:
Make
sure
the
path
of
jupyter-notebook.exe
is
saved
under
environment
variable
.
Open
your
desired
directory
either
from
windows
explorer
or
by
cd
from
command
prompt
From
the
windows
explorer
on
your
desired
folder
","
select
the
address
bar(in a way that the path label is fully selected)
and
type
jupyter-notebook.exe
voila
!
!
the
notebook
opens
from
the
desired
folder
and
any
new
notebook
will
be
saved
in
this
location
.
