So
I
was
reading
about
pagination
","
I
have
done
it
quite
a
few
times
writing
this
app
but
I
was
wondering
how
does
pagination
in
django
work
at
sql
level
.
Does
Contacts.objects.all()
get
called
evertime
I
am
hitting
the
view
?
Or
does
Paginator
maintains
a
state
somehow
?
What
would
the
sql
query
look
like
for
paginator
=
"Paginator(contact_list, 25)"
Are
there
generators
being
used
behind
the
scenes
and
things
are
lazily
evaluated
?
Sorry
if
this
is
a
dumb
question
","
there
is
a
lot
of
abstraction
in
Django
and
I
seem
to
miss
all
the
action
behind
.
Thanks
in
advance
