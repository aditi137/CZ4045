You
can
use
the
psycopg2.extensions.AsIs
to
pass
in
parameters
for
database
name
etc.
As
said
here
:
http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html#the-problem-with-the-query-parameters
Warning
Never
","
never
","
NEVER
use
Python
string
concatenation
(
+
)
or
string
parameters
interpolation
(
%
)
to
pass
variables
to
a
SQL
query
string
.
Not
even
at
gunpoint
.
Your
code
would
look
like
:
The
conn.autocommit=True
is
there
because
you
can't
create
a
database
inside
a
transaction
.
EDIT
:
Note
that
you
will
still
be
vulnerable
to
SQL
injection
when
using
AsIs
","
but
you
can
at
least
execute
queries
in
the
usual
way
(
and
CREATE
DATABASE
cannot
be
executed
from
multi-command
string
","
so
it
would
still
fail
for
new_dbname
=
my_db;DROP
DATABASE
another_db
;
