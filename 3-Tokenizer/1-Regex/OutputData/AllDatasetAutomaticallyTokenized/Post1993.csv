I
need
to
search
if
any
item
of
a
list
contains
a
specific
string
.
At
the
moment
I
use
this
code
:
The
problem
is
that
if
I
try
so
search
Height
I
got
this
:
I
need
to
match
only
Height
included
in
Height
6
'
element
","
so
that
item
[0]
will
be
the
one
that
I
need
.
What's
the
best
way
to
do
that
?
