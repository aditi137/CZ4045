I
read
the
doc
string
of
the
exception
and
It
seems
like
for
mongoalchemy
the
model
defined
doesn't
register
currentPage
as
an
attribute
of
Presentation
document
","
but
in
the
code
you
copy
pasted
the
class
definition
define
the
attribute
.
If
the
class
you
copy
pasted
is
the
class
that
you
defined
in
your
project
","
try
to
delete
.
pyc
files
in
your
project
and
re-run
the
application
.
By
the
way
currentPage
variable
name
does
not
follow
PEP8
Naming
Conventions
.
