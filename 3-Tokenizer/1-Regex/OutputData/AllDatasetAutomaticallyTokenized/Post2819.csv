The
problem
is
""""
check
the
first
four
numbers
of
a
list
","
to
see
if
any
of
them
is
a
9
""""
.
Now
","
if
the
list
is
less
than
4
","
then
automatically
the
check
will
fail
:
Next
","
you
need
to
check
if
the
first
four
items
contain
nine
.
There
are
many
ways
to
do
this
","
one
of
the
easiest
is
:
Combine
the
two
:
The
issue
with
your
initial
approach
is
you
are
forcing
the
length
to
be
4
","
and
assuming
that
at
minimum
the
array
will
have
4
elements
.
If
the
array
has
3
elements
","
then
your
code
will
not
work
.
To
avoid
this
","
don't
assume
a
specific
length
.
If
you
use
slicing
","
then
you
are
guaranteed
that
you
will
get
at
most
4
items
.
Here
is
an
example
of
this
:
Even
though
i
only
has
two
items
","
the
slice
to
4
works
and
doesn't
raise
an
error
.
Once
i
has
more
than
4
items
","
it
will
limit
to
the
first
four
:
However
","
our
problem
statement
specifically
said
that
check
if
the
first
four
items
contain
9
.
If
we
just
use
the
slice
trick
","
like
this
:
It
will
return
true
even
if
we
pass
it
an
array
like
[
'
1
'
","
'
9
'
]
since
the
slice
will
always
work
.
To
catch
this
condition
-
we
first
check
if
the
length
of
the
list
is
less
than
4
","
because
if
it
is
-
it
automatically
fails
the
condition
.
