This
is
because
QueryDict
returns
the
last
value
of
a
list
in
__getitem__
:
QueryDict.getitem(key)
Returns
the
value
for
the
given
key
.
If
the
key
has
more
than
one
value
","
getitem()
returns
the
last
value
.
Raises
django.utils.datastructures.MultiValueDictKeyError
if
the
key
does
not
exist
.
(
This
is
a
subclass
of
Pythonâ€™s
standard
KeyError
","
so
you
can
stick
to
catching
KeyError
.

If
you
post
a
form
","
in
which
a
key
maps
to
a
list
:
this
is
what
you
get
in
the
request
body
:
Since
the
test
method
post
the
data
as
a
form
","
what
you
get
from
request.data
is
a
QueryDict
(
the
same
as
request.POST
)
","
hence
you
get
the
last
value
in
the
list
when
getting
request.data
.
To
get
expected
behavior
","
post
the
data
as
JSON
in
the
request
body
(
as
in
@Vladir
Parrado
Cruz's
answer
)
.
