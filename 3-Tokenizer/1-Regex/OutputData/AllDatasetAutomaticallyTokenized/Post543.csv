Python
has
a
major
advantage
of
being
available
in
a
production-ready
format
today
.
Python
has
Jython
and
IronPython
","
if
you
need
to
work
closely
with
Java
or
the
.
net
clr
.
Perl
6
has
the
advantages
of
being
based
on
the
same
principles
as
Perl
(
1-5
)
;
If
you
like
Perl
","
you'll
like
Perl
6
for
the
same
reasons
.
(
There's
more
than
one
way
to
do
it
","
etc.
)
Perl
6
also
has
an
advantage
of
being
only
partially
implemented
:
If
you
want
to
hack
on
language
internals
or
help
to
define
the
standard
libraries
","
this
is
a
great
time
to
get
started
in
Perl
6
.
Edit
:
(
2011
)
It's
still
a
great
time
to
hack
on
the
Perl6
internals
","
but
there
is
now
a
much
more
mature
","
usable
Perl6
distribution
","
Rakudo
Star
.
If
you
want
to
use
Perl6
today
","
that's
a
great
choice
.
