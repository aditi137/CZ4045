I'm
searching
for
a
string
Number
of
copies
:
in
a
text
file
and
once
it's
found
","
I
want
to
print
the
digits
associated
with
it
","
so
I'm
searching
for
","
(
\
sNumber
of
copies
:
(
\
d{1
","
2
}
)
)
and
I
want
to
return
(
\
d{1
","
2
}
)
.
I've
been
researching
nested
groups
in
REGEX
","
but
I
don't
have
the
syntax
down
for
it
in
Python
.
Any
help
would
be
appreciated
.
Here
what
the
line
I'm
looking
for
in
a
text
file
looks
like
:
My
desired
output
would
just
be
2
and
2
because
I'm
looking
for
the
number
that
follows
the
text
.
fi2Content
represent
a
whole
text
file
read
by
Python
.
I
can
print(zDiscs)
but
I
can't
print(zDiscs.group(2)
)
.
Why
?
I
get
the
following
error
:
when
I
try
to
print(zDiscs.group(2)
)
Here's
my
whole
script
if
that
helps
troubleshooting
