goal
Understanding
how
a
radiobutton
in
a
Tkinter
menu
works
code
I
have
a
radio
button
inside
the
options
menu
as
so
:
v
=
BooleanVar()
v.set(True)
"options.add_radiobutton(label=""change pop up"", command =togglePopUp,variable=v,onvalue=True,offvalue=False)"
togglePopUp
is
a
function
that
changes
the
value
of
variable
v
from
True
to
False
or
vice
versa
.
Main
window
is
already
opened
and
this
menu
will
be
added
later
to
the
window
.
This
is
just
the
fragment
of
code
that
is
related
to
the
radiobutton
.
Question
Now
my
question
is
when
I
press
the
radiobutton
(
after
running
the
code
)
will
the
value
of
the
variable
be
changed
or
will
the
function
togglePopUp
be
called
?
If
the
function
will
be
called
then
what
will
happen
to
the
status
of
the
radiobutton
?
will
the
status
of
the
radiobutton
be
updated
instantly
or
will
there
be
a
delay
?
research
I
read
about
the
radiobutton
and
the
Boolean
variable
from
the
Tkinter
book
at
effbot.org
.
But
I
was
not
convinced
about
how
it
worked
.
I
tried
a
program
but
I
am
not
getting
the
output
that
I
essentially
want
.
So
I
decided
to
understand
how
it
works
at
a
deeper
level
.
