Answering
my
own
question
here
","
but
if
anyone
knows
better
feel
free
to
answer
too
.
Some
of
it
seems
quite
fragile
(
eg
.
version
numbers
in
paths
)
","
so
comment
or
edit
if
you
know
a
better
way
.

.
Finding
the
files
Firstly
","
I
use
this
code
to
actually
find
the
root
of
the
GTK
runtime
.
This
is
very
specific
to
how
you
install
the
runtime
","
though
","
and
could
probably
be
improved
with
a
number
of
checks
for
common
locations
:

.
What
files
to
include
This
depends
on
(
a
)
how
much
of
a
concern
size
is
","
and
(
b
)
the
context
of
your
application's
deployment
.
By
that
I
mean
","
are
you
deploying
it
to
the
whole
wide
world
where
anyone
can
have
an
arbitrary
locale
setting
","
or
is
it
just
for
internal
corporate
use
where
you
don't
need
translated
stock
strings
?
If
you
want
Windows
theming
","
you'll
need
to
include
:
If
you
want
the
Tango
icons
:
There
is
also
localisation
data
(
which
I
omit
","
but
you
might
not
want
to
)
:

.
Piecing
it
together
Firstly
","
here's
a
function
that
walks
the
filesystem
tree
at
a
given
point
and
produces
output
suitable
for
the
data_files
option
.
So
now
you
can
call
setup()
like
so
:
