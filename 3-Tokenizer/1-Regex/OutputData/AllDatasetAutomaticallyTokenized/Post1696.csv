I'm
using
Scrapy
to
scrape
some
gold
that's
behind
an
authentication
screen
.
The
website
uses
ASP.net
and
ASP's
got
some
stupid
hidden
fields
littered
all
over
the
form
(
like
__VIEWSTATE
","
__EVENTTARGET
)
.
When
I
call
FormRequest.from_response(response
","
...
I'm
expecting
that
it
reads
these
hidden
fields
automatically
from
the
response
and
populates
them
in
the
formdata
dictionary
-
which
is
what
Scrapy's
FormRequest
documentation
says
it
should
do
.
But
if
that's
the
case
","
then
why
does
the
login
process
only
work
when
I
explicitly
list
these
fields
and
populate
them
?
Edit
:
Adding
form
HTML
