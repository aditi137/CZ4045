I
am
going
to
implement
below
C
#
piece
of
code
in
Python
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
","
when
I
instantiate
an
object
from
class
B
","
I
am
prone
to
get
some
flexibility
to
choose
between
the
parent-version
or
child
version
of
the
overrided
method
","
just
like
below
:
Where
the
output
is
:
But
I
have
no
clear
idea
to
the
same
with
super
keyword
in
python
.
I
have
written
below
code
:
where
the
output
is
:
which
is
not
my
desired
output
;
in
the
latter
case
","
i.e.
Python
one
","
the
two
strings
are
generated
just
by
one
method
call
.
Would
you
please
help
me
to
change
the
python
code
so
that
the
desired
output
is
acquired
?
