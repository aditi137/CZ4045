I
am
writing
a
web
service
using
Django
that
will
be
consumed
from
a
MS
SharePoint
workflow
.
In
the
SP
workflow
","
I
created
a
dictionary
with
2
items
(
id:1
","
text:'foo
'
)
","
and
used
this
dictionary
as
the
request
content
.
However
","
instead
of
using
the
dictionary
to
format
a
traditional
POST
parameter
list
","
it
sends
it
as
a
JSON
object
in
the
body
of
the
POST
request
","
so
instead
of
the
expected
:
in
the
body
of
the
request
","
there
is
this
:
which
of
course
","
in
turn
","
does
not
get
parsed
correctly
by
Python
/
Django
(
I
am
not
sure
who
exactly
does
the
parsing
)
.
How
can
I
either
get
it
to
parse
JSON
","
or
get
SharePoint
to
send
traditionally
encoded
POST
parameters
?
EDIT
I
saw
other
posts
that
explain
how
to
get
the
raw
body
and
parse
the
JSON
.
I
was
looking
for
a
solution
that
would
either
:
Make
SharePoint
send
normal
data
","
or
Get
Django
to
respect
the
Content-type
header
that
states
the
data
is
JSON
