Here
is
my
scenario
:
I
want
to
execute
local
fab
command
to
rsync
code
in
the
bastion
server
to
the
web
server
parallel
","
but
I
find
rsync_project
can
only
run
as
a
local
command
","
fail
to
find
code
base
path
in
my
local
machine
.
How
to
slove
this
issue
","
and
is
there
a
way
to
set
local
host
string
as
the
bastion
server
to
let
rsync_project
run
on
the
bastion
server
properly
?
Thank
you
for
you
time
.
