Here's
an
example
using
your
provided
10x10
grid
.
It
should
give
you
the
basic
idea
of
how
to
implement
this
.
Just
make
sure
you
keep
a
reference
to
every
Checkbutton
(
boxes
in
the
example
)
as
well
as
every
IntVar
(
boxVars
in
the
example
)
.
Here's
why
:
-
Checkbuttons
are
needed
to
call
config(state = DISABLED/NORMAL)
.
-
IntVars
are
needed
to
determine
the
value
of
each
Checkbutton
.
Aside
from
those
crucial
elements
its
basically
just
some
2D
array
processing
.
Here's
my
example
code
(
now
based
off
of
your
provided
code
)
.
