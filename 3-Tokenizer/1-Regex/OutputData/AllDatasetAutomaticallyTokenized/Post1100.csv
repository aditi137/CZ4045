The
problem
is
in
this
line
:
The
backward
slash
has
a
special
meaning
.
For
example
","
the
character
""""
\
t
""""
in
a
normal
string
is
the
tab
character
:
That's
why
in
your
error
message
:
You
see
a
double
slash
in
front
of
the
R
-
-
\
R
doesn't
have
any
special
meaning
","
and
so
it
knew
you
meant
one
""""
real
""""
slash
:
but
\
t
does
have
a
special
meaning
.
To
solve
this
problem
you
can
either
use
a
""""
raw
string
""""
","
and
add
""""
r
""""
before
the
string
literal
:
or
","
you
can
simply
use
forward
slashes
instead
-
-
which
Windows
supports
-
-
and
avoid
all
the
trouble
:
Either
way
should
work
.
