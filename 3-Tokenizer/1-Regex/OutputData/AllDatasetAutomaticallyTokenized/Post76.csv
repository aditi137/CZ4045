If
I'm
not
mistaken
the
zip
function
you
use
in
python
creates
a
pair
of
the
items
found
in
list1
and
list2
.
Basically
it
still
is
a
for
loop
with
the
addition
that
it
will
retrieve
the
data
from
the
two
seperate
lists
for
you
","
instead
that
you
have
to
do
it
yourself
.
So
maybe
your
best
option
is
to
use
a
standard
for
loop
like
this
:
or
whatever
you
have
to
do
with
the
data
.
If
you
really
are
talking
about
parallel
computing
then
you
should
take
a
look
at
the
Parallel
Computing
Toolbox
for
matlab
","
and
