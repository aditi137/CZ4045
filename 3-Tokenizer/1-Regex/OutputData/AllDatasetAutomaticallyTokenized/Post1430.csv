Is
there
a
good
reason
why
I
shouldn't
start
all
my
python
programs
with
this
?
Is
there
something
special
lost
when
doing
exec
like
this
?
There
are
60
questions
about
PYTHONIOENCODING
so
I
guess
it's
a
common
problem
","
but
in
case
you
don't
know
","
this
is
done
because
when
sys.stdout.encoding
=
=
None
then
you
can
only
print
ascii
chars
","
so
e.g
.
print
""""
åäö
""""
will
throw
an
exception
.
.
EDIT
This
happens
to
me
when
stdout
is
a
pipe
;
python
encoding.py|cat
will
set
encoding
to
None
Another
solution
is
to
change
the
codec
of
stdout
sys.stdout
=
codecs.getwriter('utf8')
(
sys.stdout
)
which
I'm
guessing
is
the
correct
answer
dispite
the
comments
on
that
question
.
