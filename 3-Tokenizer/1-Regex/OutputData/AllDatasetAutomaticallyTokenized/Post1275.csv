You
can
check
whether
the
cursor
is
null
easily
:
Otherwise
the
usual
thing
in
Python
is
to
""""
ask
for
forgiveness
not
permission
""""
:
use
your
database
connection
and
if
it
has
timed
out
catch
the
exception
and
handle
it
(
otherwise
you
might
just
find
that
it
times
out
between
your
test
and
the
point
where
you
use
it
)
.
