I've
got
a
fairly
simple
Python
script
:
When
I
run
it
","
I
sometimes
get
this
:
Other
times
","
though
","
the
script
runs
just
fine
.
All
my
other
Python
scripts
also
work
fine
.
This
error
doesn't
really
give
me
enough
context
to
even
know
where
to
look
.
Any
ideas
?
Even
just
a
way
to
get
some
actual
debug
info
would
be
appreciated
.
