I
am
able
to
fire
up
AWS
Ubuntu
EC2
instance
with
boto
.
Have
anyone
tried
to
upload
the
script
to
the
remote
Ubuntu
EC2
(
More
than
1
)
and
execute
the
script
via
SSH
locally
?
The
main
objective
is
to
automate
the
whole
process
using
a
Python
script
written
on
localhost
.
Is
there
an
alternative
way
or
Amazon
api
tools
to
made
this
possible
?
