I
am
learning
Apache-Spark
as
well
as
its
interface
with
AWS
.
I've
already
created
a
master
node
on
AWS
with
6
slave
nodes
.
I
also
have
the
following
Python
code
written
with
Spark
:
My
question
is
how
I
can
set
up
the
6
slave
nodes
in
AWS
","
such
that
5
slave
nodes
do
the
mapping
work
as
I
mentioned
in
the
code
","
and
the
other
slave
node
do
the
reducing
work
.
I
really
appreciate
if
anyone
helps
me
.
