I
have
a
dict
","
that
looks
like
this
:
And
I
need
to
get
it
to
look
like
:
I
should
point
out
that
there
can
and
will
be
multiple
top-level
keys
(
'
foo
'
in
this
case
)
.
I
could
probably
throw
something
together
to
get
what
i
need
","
but
I
was
hoping
that
there
is
a
solution
that's
more
efficient
.
