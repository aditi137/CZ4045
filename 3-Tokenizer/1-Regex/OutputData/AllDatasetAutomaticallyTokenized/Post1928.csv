I'm
wondering
whether
there
is
a
Pythonic
way
to
compute
the
means
and
variances
of
Counters
?
For
example
","
I
have
four
Counters
sharing
the
same
keys
:
My
way
to
do
that
is
:
I
could
use
the
following
code
to
find
the
mean
/
variance
for
each
key
:
Is
there
an
easier
way
to
compute
the
mean
/
variance
for
each
key
compared
to
my
way
?
