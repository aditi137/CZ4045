While
it's
true
that
id(object)
gets
the
object's
address
in
the
default
CPython
implementation
","
this
is
generally
useless
...
you
can't
do
anything
with
the
address
from
pure
Python
code
.
The
only
time
you
would
actually
be
able
to
use
the
address
is
from
a
C
extension
library
...
in
which
case
it
is
trivial
to
get
the
object's
address
since
Python
objects
are
always
passed
around
as
C
pointers
.
