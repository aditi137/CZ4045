I
am
having
an
issue
where
by
I
am
unable
to
connect
to
the
AR
Drone
2
camera
when
the
drone
is
connected
through
ROS
using
the
ardrone_autonomy
ardrone.launch
.
I
think
the
issue
is
due
to
the
fact
that
I
am
trying
to
access
the
drone
camera
through
the
IP
address
with
OpenCV
and
Python
while
connected
through
ardrone_autonomy
.
Below
is
a
code
snippet
of
how
I
am
accomplishing
this
.
As
you
can
see
that
I
am
using
the
IP
address
for
the
camera
.
This
works
perfectly
when
the
drone
is
not
connected
through
ROS
which
is
essentially
like
a
webcam
.
My
end
goal
is
for
tracking
and
navigation
through
the
use
of
images
received
from
the
camera
using
OpenCV
which
means
I
will
have
to
issue
movement
commands(cmd_vel)
which
requires
a
connection
through
ardrone_autonomy
based
on
the
images
received
and
processed
by
OpenCV
.
Is
there
anyway
I
can
accomplish
this
by
using
the
IP
camera
from
the
drone
while
connected
to
ROS
?
Thanks
for
any
help
!
