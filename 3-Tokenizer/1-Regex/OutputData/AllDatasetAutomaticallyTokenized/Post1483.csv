Say
for
example
I
want
to
match
a
substring
if
it
contains
a
certain
number
of
some
character
.
However
","
I
don't
know
the
exact
amount
that
character
is
","
but
I
know
it
is
not
negative
.
How
would
I
write
this
regex
?
Is
this
possible
to
do
?
If
so
","
how
do
I
do
it
?
EDIT
:
Example
input
:
k
=
2
string
=
01010
Expected
output
:
""""
101
""""
","
""""
0101
""""
","
""""
1010
""""
","
""""
01010
""""
So
in
each
substring
","
it
contains
exactly
2
characters
'
1
'
