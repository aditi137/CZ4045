I'm
not
very
familiar
with
Python
","
and
I
am
just
discovering
GDB
python
scripting
capabilities
;
the
motivation
of
my
question
is
to
enhance
the
GDB
printing
of
values
inside
the
MELT
monitor
which
will
later
be
connected
to
GCC
MELT
.
But
here
is
a
simpler
variant
.
My
system
is
Linux
/
Debian
/
Sid
/
x86-64
.
the
GCC
compiler
is
4.8.2
;
the
GDB
debugger
is
7.6.2
;
its
python
is
3.3
I
want
to
debug
a
C
program
with
a
""""
discriminated
union
""""
type
:
Here
is
my
Python
file
to
be
read
under
gdb
I'm
stuck
with
the
following
basic
questions
.
How
to
install
my
pretty
printer
in
python
under
GDB
?
(
I'm
seeing
several
ways
in
the
documentation
","
and
I
can't
choose
the
appropriate
one
)
.
How
to
ensure
that
GDB
pretty-prints
both
union
my_un
and
its
typedef-ed
synonym
myval_t
the
same
way
.
How
should
the
pretty
printer
detect
NULL
pointers
?
How
can
my
pretty
printer
recurse
for
struct
boxsequence_st
?
This
means
detecting
that
the
pointer
is
non-nil
","
then
dereferencing
its
ptag
","
comparing
that
tag
to
tag_sequence
","
pretty
printing
the
valtab
flexible
array
member
.
How
to
avoid
recursing
too
deeply
the
pretty
printing
?
