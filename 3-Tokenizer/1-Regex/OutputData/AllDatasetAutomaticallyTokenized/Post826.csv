How
about
these
:
BadLinksPlugin
:
This
plugin
logs
bad
local
links
found
in
wiki
content
.
It's
a
quite
new
one
","
just
deals
with
dangling
links
","
but
any
bad
links
as
I
see
from
source
code
.
This
is
at
least
one
building
block
to
your
solution
request
.
VisitCounterMacro
:
Macro
displays
how
many
times
was
wiki
page
displayed
.
This
is
a
rather
old
one
.
You'll
get
just
the
statistic
per
page
while
an
administrative
view
is
missing
","
but
this
could
be
built
rather
easily
","
i.e.
like
a
custom
PageIndex
.
