I'm
experimenting
with
pandas
and
non-matplotlib
plotting
.
Good
suggestions
are
here
.
This
question
regards
yhat's
ggplot
and
I
am
running
into
two
issues
.
Plotting
a
series
in
pandas
is
easy
.
I
don't
see
how
to
do
this
in
the
ggplot
docs
.
Instead
I
end
up
creating
a
dataframe
:
I
would
expect
ggplot
-
-
a
project
that
has
""""
tight
integration
with
pandas
""""
-
-
to
have
a
way
to
plot
a
simple
series
.
Second
issue
is
I
can't
get
stat_smooth()
to
display
when
the
x
axis
is
time
of
day
.
Seems
like
it
could
be
related
to
this
post
","
but
I
don't
have
the
rep
to
post
there
.
My
code
is
:
Any
help
regarding
non-matplotlib
plotting
would
be
appreciated
.
Thanks
!

I'm
using
ggplot
0.5.8
