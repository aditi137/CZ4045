You
do
need
to
import the
modules
somehow
but
the
“
recommended
”
way
is
a
bit
tricky
since
things
kept
changing
with
new
versions
of
Python
","
see
this
answer
.
Here's
an
example
based
on
the
test
runner
of
the
gorilla
library
that
is
compatible
with
Python
2
and
Python
3
:
Here
/
path
/
to
/
your
/
package
would
be
the
repository
to
the
package
","
that
is
the
directory
containing
the
readme
","
the
docs
","
and
so
on
like
it
is
commonly
the
case
with
Python's
packages
","
and
package_name
would
be
the
directory
name
inside
the
repository
that
contains
the
root
__init__.py
file
.
In
fact
the
function
module_iterator
also
accepts
a
module
for
its
parameter
package_dotted_path
","
such
as
'
package.subpackage.module
'
for
example
","
but
then
only
the
functions
from
this
specific
module
would
be
retrieved
.
If
a
package
is
passed
instead
","
then
all
the
recursively
nested
modules
will
be
inspected
.
