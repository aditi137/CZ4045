I
think
the
problem
is
","
that
you
didn't
tell
Scrapy
to
follow
each
crawled
URL
.
For
my
own
blog
I've
implemented
a
CrawlSpider
that
uses
LinkExtractor-based
Rules
to
extract
all
relevant
links
from
my
blog
pages
:
On
https://www.ask-sheldon.com/build-a-website-crawler-using-scrapy-framework/
I've
described
detailed
how
I've
implemented
a
website
crawler
to
warm
up
my
Wordpress
fullpage
cache
.
