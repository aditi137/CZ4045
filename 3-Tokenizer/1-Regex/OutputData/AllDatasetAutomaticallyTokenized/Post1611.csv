I'm
currently
doing
a
""""
Spell
Checker
""""
problem
.
I
have
already
created
a
list
that
holds
the
dictionary
.
Now
I'm
trying
to
see
if
word
is
in
the
list
.
I'm
new
to
using
classes
with
Python
so
I
am
probably
missing
something
tiny
.
Recent
error
has
been
""""
TypeError
:
'
list
'
object
cannot
be
interpreted
as
an
integer
""""
Here
is
an
excerpt
of
code
.
