Their
is
an
option
introduced
in
0.13.1
(
might
have
been
0.13.0
)
","
where
you
can
set
dropna=False
on
a
put
/
append
to
avoid
dropping
an
all-NaN
row
.
This
is
done
for
efficiency
","
as
most
of
the
time
in
say
storing
a
Panel
","
you
have
lots
of
all-NaN
rows
","
but
no
reason
to
store
them
.
Otherwise
the
frequency
information
will
be
preserved
.
Note
that
if
you
are
appending
the
frequency
information
will
NOT
be
preserved
if
you
append
multiple
times
.
You
can
always
pd.infer_freq(an_index)
if
you
need
to
re-infer
the
freqency
(
if
possible
)
.
Normally
this
is
done
automatically
in
any
event
if
needed
.
