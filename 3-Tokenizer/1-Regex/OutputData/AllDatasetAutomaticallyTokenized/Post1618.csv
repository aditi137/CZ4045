I'm
trying
to
start
an
environment
using
virtualenv
but
i
can't
install
the
packages
i
need
because
pip
wont
download
them
.
According
to
what
I've
found
the
problem
was
that
the
version
of
pip
i
was
using
didn't
work
well
because
of
SSL
veryfying
reasons
so
I
downgraded
to
pip
1.2.1
and
pip
would
then
download
the
packages
with
no
problems
.
However
whenever
I
try
to
use
virtualenv
it
automatically
installs
the
newest
version
of
pip
which
gives
me
the
SSL
veryfying
errors
.
Is
there
any
way
to
make
virtualenv
install
an
older
version
of
pip
?
I'm
fairly
new
to
python
and
it's
the
first
time
ive
used
virtualenv
.
Also
I'm
using
the
terminal
on
OSX
Lion
