From
OP's
comment
I
think
the
minimal
solution
a
set
of
helper
functions
instead
of
classes
.
the
xmltodict
library
makes
it
easy
to
turn
the
XML
data
into
nested
dictionaries
","
more
or
less
like
JSON
.
A
set
of
helpers
that
parse
the
contents
and
generate
appropriate
C-struct
strings
is
all
that's
really
needed
.
If
you
can
work
with
dictionaries
:
You
can
do
something
like

Which
will
produce
something
like

I'd
try
to
get
it
working
with
basic
functions
first
before
trying
to
build
up
a
class
scaffold
.
It
would
be
pretty
easy
to
hide
the
details
in
a
class
using
property
descriptors
:
