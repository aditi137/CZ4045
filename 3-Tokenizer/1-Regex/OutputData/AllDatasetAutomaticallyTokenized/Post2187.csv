One
of
my
folders
has
mostly
json
files
","
and
I'm
reading
the
data
they
contain
to
do
some
classification
for
an
SVM
.
A
question
I
had
was
based
on
this
code
:
Each
time
I
pipe
the
output
","
I
find
that
the
filenames
always
get
printed
in
the
same
order
","
like
so
:
There
are
a
few
text
files
","
and
some
python
files
in
this
directory
.
My
question
here
is
:
what
determines
the
order
in
which
these
files
are
printed
?
Does
the
for
loop
have
a
way
of
looking
for
files
?
I
tried
examining
whether
this
order
is
based
on
size
(
max
to
min
or
min
to
max
)
or
last
"modified(I had no reason for these tests,I just tried them since I can't think of any other insight)"
.
I
tried
this
snippet
4
times
","
and
the
order
is
the
same
each
time
.
I
have
a
labelled
classes
in
different
folders
","
so
if
I
can
be
assured
of
the
order
it
would
be
helpful
in
the
labeling
for
my
training
set(I don't know how good an idea this is)
.
