I'm
writing
a
blog
editor
using
pyqt4
.
My
issue
is
this
.
There
is
a
wysiwyg
editor
tab
and
a
html
code
editor
tab
.
A
change
done
in
one
should
reflect
in
the
other
.
One
option
is
to
use
the
setHtml
and
toHtml
functions
whenever
text
changes
in
a
qtextedit
.
But
the
issue
with
this
approach
is
that
when
I
use
setHtml
on
a
qtextedit
","
all
the
previous
edit
undo
history
is
lost
.
If
I
try
to
maintain
my
own
history
on
textchanged
signal
","
lots
of
memory
will
be
used
.
Consider
I
enter
a
sentence
","
textchanged
will
be
signaled
for
every
single
character
and
undo
would
be
character
by
character
.
I
tried
sharing
the
same
qtextdocument
between
the
two
qtextedits
but
that
also
failed
as
highlighting
is
linked
to
the
qtextdocument
and
hence
is
applied
to
both
qtextedits
.
Another
option
is
to
do
nothing
when
the
user
works
in
the
wysiwyg
editor
window
.
When
the
user
makes
some
edit
in
the
html
code
editor
","
I'll
wait
till
the
user
finishes
the
edit
and
then
once
done
","
I'll
find
the
diff
of
the
edit
and
somehow
","
make
a
corresponding
edit
change
in
the
wysiwyg
editor's
qtextdocument
.
Is
this
achievable
?
How
can
I
do
such
a
change
in
the
qtextdocument
?
Is
there
a
more
simple
way
that
I
am
not
aware
of
?
Please
help
.
