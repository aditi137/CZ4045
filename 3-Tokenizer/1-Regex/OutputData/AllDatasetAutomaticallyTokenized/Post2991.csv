Here's
one
method
that
splits
the
data
into
nested
lists
and
then
constructs
a
dict
.
I'm
largely
guessing
at
the
desired
data
structure
.
Disclaimer
:
there
is
likely
a
more
efficient
way
of
doing
this
with
regex
","
and
this
method
isn't
ideal
if
reading
the
entire
file
into
memory
is
going
to
be
an
issue
.
Output
:
