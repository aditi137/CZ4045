The
universal
problem
with
tabs
is
that
they
can
be
represented
differently
in
different
environment
.
In
a
given
editor
","
a
tab
might
be
8
spaces
or
it
might
be
2
.
In
some
editors
","
you
can
control
this
","
while
in
others
you
can't
.
Another
issue
with
tabs
is
how
they
are
represented
in
printed
output
.
I
believe
most
printers
interpret
a
tab
as
8
spaces
.
With
spaces
","
there
is
no
doubt
.
Everything
will
line
up
as
the
author
intended
.
