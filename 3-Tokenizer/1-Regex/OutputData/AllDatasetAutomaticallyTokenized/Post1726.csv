I
have
my
webapp
written
in
Python
running
on
Google
App
Engine
;
so
far
only
testing
in
my
localhost
.
My
script
needs
to
read
text
files
located
in
various
directories
.
So
in
my
Python
script
I
would
simply
use
"os.chdir(""./""+subdirectory_name)"
and
then
start
opening
and
reading
the
files
and
using
the
text
for
analysis
.
However
I
cannot
do
that
when
trying
to
move
it
over
to
App
Engine
.
I
assume
I
need
to
make
some
sort
of
changes
to
app.yaml
but
I'm
stuck
after
that
.
Can
anyone
walk
me
through
this
somewhat
thoroughly
?
From
the
answer
below
","
I
was
able
to
fix
this
part
","
I
have
a
followup
question
about
the
app.yaml
structure
though
.
I
have
my
folder
set
up
like
the
following
","
and
I'm
wondering
what
I
need
to
put
in
my
app.yaml
file
to
make
it
work
when
I
deploy
the
project
(
it
works
perfectly
on
localhost
right
now
)
.
Main_Folder
:
python_my_app.py
app.yaml
text_file1
text_file2
text_file3
subfolder1_with_10_text_files_inside
subfolder2_with_10_text_files_inside
subfolder3_with_10_text_files_inside
...
how
do
I
specify
this
structure
in
my
app.yaml
and
do
I
need
to
change
anything
in
my
code
if
it
works
right
now
on
localhost
?
