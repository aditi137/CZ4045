I
have
a
CSV
file
with
:
area
ID
area
name
URL
of
a
KML
file
with
the
area
boundaries
:
http://link.to/area_ID.kml
How
can
I
load
in
the
KML
to
a
column
in
the
CSV
in
order
to
upload
it
to
Fusion
Tables
?
I'm
working
in
Python
.
The
KML
is
also
available
as
JSON
if
that
helps
.
I
know
that
I
need
to
add
it
as
a
geometry
column
in
the
Fusion
Table
:
I
just
literally
don't
understand
how
to
get
it
into
the
CSV
file
so
that
I
can
then
upload
it
to
Fusion
Tables
.
Thanks
for
your
help
.
UPDATE
:
I've
tried
to
write
the
KML
as
a
string
to
the
column
in
the
CSV
(
<
Polygon
>
....
<
/
Polygon
>
)
","
but
Fusion
Tables
is
refusing
to
import it
","
with
a
502
error
-
perhaps
because
the
file
is
now
very
large
.
