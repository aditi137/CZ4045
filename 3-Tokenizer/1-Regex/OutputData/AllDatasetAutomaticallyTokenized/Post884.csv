How
do
I
find
the
program
associated
with
a
given
file
type
using
Python
under
Windows
?
For
example
","
given
http
I'd
like
python
to
determine
the
default
browser
.
I
can
do
this
from
a
cmd
prompt
by
running
'
ftype
http'.
Windows
gives
me
the
full
path
to
the
browser
.
I've
tried
:
which
results
in
:
WindowsError
:
[
Error
2
]
The
system
cannot
find
the
file
specified
which
launches
a
cmd
window
","
but
doesn't
do
anything
else
