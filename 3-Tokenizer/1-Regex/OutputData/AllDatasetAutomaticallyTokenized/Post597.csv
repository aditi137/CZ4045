I'm
totally
","
completely
new
to
programming
","
so
please
forgive
what
is
probably
a
stupid
question
","
but
I've
been
beating
my
head
on
this
for
the
past
couple
of
days
.
I
have
two
models
","
Photos
and
Thumbnails
.
I'm
trying
to
come
up
with
an
easy
","
dynamic
way
to
get
the
thumbnail
links
for
each
Photo
.
I've
come
up
a
function
that
does
this
(
get_thumbs
)
but
I'd
like
it
to
run
automatically
when
the
model
is
called
(
basically
so
that
I
get
Photo.get_%s_url
%
thumb.name
as
soon
as
the
model
is
available
)
.
Below
is
my
models.py
.
Any
help
or
nudge
in
the
right
direction
(
even
if
it's
just
""""
google
blah
""""
)
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
Thanks
.
