So
in
order
to
parse
a
JSON
with
bash
","
I
use
python
-
mjson.tool
to
grep
the
field
and
awk
to
get
the
value
.
I
used
to
pipe
it
right
after
curl
","
so
I
could
do
something
like
curl
$url
|
python
-
mjson.tool
|
grep
(
something
)
|
awk
(
something
)
But
I
want
to
store
the
curl
output
to
a
variable
and
send
that
to
the
python
-
mjson.tool
.
I
tried
python
-
mjson.tool
$json
or
python
-
mjson.tool
<
<
<
$json
but
neither
has
worked
.
Is
there
a
way
to
feed
in
a
json
variable
to
python
?
Also
","
I
cannot
use
jq
.
