You
might
want
to
look
into
PropertySheets
.
These
are
files
containing
Visual
C
+
+
settings
","
including
user
macros
.
The
sheets
can
inherit
from
other
sheets
and
are
attached
to
VC
+
+
projects
using
the
PropertyManager
View
in
Visual
Studio
.
When
you
create
one
of
these
sheets
","
there
is
an
interface
for
creating
user
macros
.
When
you
add
a
macro
using
this
mechanism
","
there
is
a
checkbox
for
setting
the
user
macro
as
an
environment
variable
.
We
use
this
type
of
mechanism
in
our
build
system
to
rapidly
set
up
projects
to
perform
out-of-place
builds
.
Our
various
build
directories
are
all
defined
as
user
macros
.
I
have
not
actually
verified
that
the
environment
variables
are
set
in
an
external
script
called
from
post-build
.
I
tend
to
use
these
macros
as
command
line
arguments
to
my
post-build
scripts
-
but
I
would
expect
accessing
them
as
environment
variables
should
work
for
you
.
