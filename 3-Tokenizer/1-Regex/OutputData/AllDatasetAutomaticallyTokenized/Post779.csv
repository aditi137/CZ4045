I
have
a
system
that
accepts
MP3
uploads
to
the
BlobStore
","
and
now
I
would
like
to
embed
them
in
an
HTML5
player
.
The
trouble
is
:
I
can't
seem
to
get
a
link
directly
to
the
MP3
file
.
I've
used
images.get_serving_url(blob_key)
to
great
effect
","
but
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
equivalent
for
audio
files
.
The
documentation
explains
how
to
create
a
handler
that
serves
any
file
from
the
blobstore
","
with
two
slightly
different
approaches
:
BlobstoreDownloadHandler
and
Sample
App
Both
had
the
same
result
for
me
","
which
you
can
see
here
:

This
is
supposed
to
be
a
3
+
minute
song
","
but
usually
only
the
first
few
seconds
come
through
.
Refreshing
the
page
will
randomly
change
the
amount
that
is
streamed
(
sometimes
you
get
lucky
and
10
seconds
play
!
)
.
The
HTTP
header
(
gotten
via
curl
)
looks
like
this
:
Ultimately
","
I
want
to
be
able
to
use
an
embedded
player
of
some
kind
.
However
","
the
following
code
yields
a
big
X
in
firefox
.
