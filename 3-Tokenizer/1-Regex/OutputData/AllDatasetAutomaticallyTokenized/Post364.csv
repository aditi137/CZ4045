wxPython
","
and
I'm
assuming
PyGTK
also
","
can
use
wxGlade
to
help
you
design
most
UIs
you
will
create
.
That
is
a
big
plus
.
You
don't
have
to
learn
how
to
hand-code
the
GUI
until
you're
ready
.
I
made
several
GUI
programs
straight
from
wxGlade
before
I
was
comfortable
enough
in
how
wxPython
worked
to
take
a
shot
at
hand-coding
.
PyQt
has
a
similar
graphic
layout
device
but
I've
never
had
good
luck
getting
PyQt
to
compile
correctly
.
There
was
also
a
lack
of
tutorials
and
documentation
that
showed
how
to
create
the
final
Python
code
;
many
of
the
documents
I
found
referred
to
the
C
+
+
version
of
Qt
.
Tkinter
is
good
for
quick
and
dirty
programs
but
","
realistically
","
if
you
use
wxGlade
it
may
be
faster
to
make
the
program
with
wxPython
.
At
a
minimum
","
you
can
use
wxGlade
to
show
a
visual
representation
of
the
program
to
a
client
rather
than
take
the
time
to
hand-code
the
""""
dummy
""""
program
.
