tab_change
can
show
their
id
and
names
","
but
not
correctly
.
When
Tab1
is
clicked
","
I
clicked
Tab2
but
it
still
print
0
Tab1
","
it
needs
one
more
click
to
print
1
Tab2
.
Tab2
click
to
Tab1
is
the
same
","
it
needs
one
more
click
to
show
the
current
selected
tab
.
I
want
to
find
why
the
tabs
need
double
click
?
And
how
can
I
get
selected
tab
correctly
by
a
single
click
?
