I
wrote
this
simple
function
""""
processing_flush
""""
in
order
to
print
a
sequence
of
points
(
given
by
index
)
to
test
if
my
software
is
processing
my
data
and
eventually
the
speed
.
The
total
size
of
my
data
is
unknown
.
The
problem
that
i
cannot
fix
is
when
all
points
are
printed
the
first
time
(
ex
:
Processing
....
if
index
is
equal
to
5
)
the
cursor
doesn't
start
from
zero
.
