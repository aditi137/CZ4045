I've
got
a
script
running
that
I
want
to
toggle
between
different
variables
.
Let's
say
I've
got
a
list
of
urls
and
I
want
to
concatenate
one
of
the
variables
a
","
b
or
c
.
I
don't
care
which
but
I'd
expect
the
variables
to
repeat
but
the
list
would
run
through
once
.
v
would
end
up
looking
like
url1+string1
url2+string2
url3+string3
url4+string1
url5+string2
etc
I
was
able
to
get
this
to
work
on
my
own
but
I'm
new
and
learning
","
does
anyone
have
a
more
elegant
solution
to
this
?
it
returns
what
I
was
looking
for
but
it's
messy
:
string1a
string2b
string3c
string4a
string5b
string6c
string7a
string8b
