The
error
message
says
that
installer
tries
to
delete
file
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
json_util.py
but
it
fails
because
you
don't
have
permissions
.
There
are
two
possible
reasons
:
You
are
trying
to
install
mongoengine
as
a
different
user
from
the
one
who
own
the
virtualenv
.
Let's
assume
that
you
are
logged
in
as
user
holms
so
your
bash
prompt
looks
like
:
[
holms@localhost
~
]
$
Now
check
ownership
of
virtualenv
with
:
ls
-
la
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
|
grep
backend
If
the
output
should
look
like
:
drwxr-xr-x
.
9
holms
holms
4096
05-06
15:49
backend
If
instead
of
holms
you
get
for
example
bruce
then
virtualenv
is
owned
by
this
user
and
you
should
perform
installation
as
bruce
:
sudo
su
-
bruce
source
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
bin
/
activate
pip
install
mongoengine
You
are
logged
in
as
the
correct
user
but
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
json_util.py
is
owned
by
someone
else
.
Again
I'm
assuming
that
your
username
is
holms
.
Check
permissions
:
ls
-
la
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
|
grep
json_util.py
If
you
see
that
someone
else
e.g
.
bruce
owns
this
specific
file
then
change
the
ownerschip
:
sudo
chown
holms:holms
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
Now
you
should
be
able
to
install
mongoengine
.
