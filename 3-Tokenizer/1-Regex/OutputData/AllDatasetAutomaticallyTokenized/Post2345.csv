I'm
trying
to
aggregate
the
mean
visits
per
page
made
by
visitors
to
a
website
grouped
by
their
visitor
id's
and
pages
they
visited
.
In
the
example
data
below
unique_visit
is
the
individual
visits
","
visitor_id
is
who
visited
","
and
page
is
the
page
they
visited
.
I
want
to
compute
the
following
:
visitor
009903
visited
page
3ghtr
three
times
","
page
4ifac
once
and
page
9fgvb
once
.
The
mean
page
visits
of
visitor
009903
is
therefore
x
.
And
do
this
for
each
visitor
.
I'm
aiming
to
return
an
aggregated
DataFrame
/
Series
where
column
1
would
be
the
visitor_id
and
column
2
would
be
a
mean
number
as
an
'
int64
'
.
