One
possibility
would
be
to
use
filter
:
Instead
of
the
partial
one
could
also
use
the
__ne__
method
of
'
c
'
here
:
However
","
the
latter
approach
is
not
considered
very
pythonic
(
normally
you
shouldn't
use
special
methods
-
starting
with
double
underscores
-
directly
)
and
it
could
give
weird
results
if
the
list
contains
mixed
types
but
it
could
be
a
bit
faster
than
the
partial
approach
.
