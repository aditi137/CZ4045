I
was
using
gdata
module
to
access
","
upload
","
download
files
from
google
doc
.
I
have
the
oauth
key
and
secret
with
me
.
Now
I
want
to
switch
to
google
drive
api
.
Learning
and
studying
a
bit
on
google
drive
api
","
it
looks
like
a
bit
different
in
the
authentication
.
I
also
have
downloaded
pydrive
module
so
as
I
can
start
things
up
.
But
I
am
not
able
to
authorize
my
server
side
python
code
to
authorize
/
authenticate
the
user
using
my
oauth
keys
and
access
my
drive
.
Do
any
one
has
any
spare
know
how
on
how
I
can
use
pydrive
to
access
my
drive
with
my
previous
auth
keys
.
I
just
need
a
simple
way
to
authenticate
.
