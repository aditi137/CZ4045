I'm
using
networkx(library for python to deal with graphs)
.
I
basically
have
nodes
with
various
edges
but
want
to
see
what
a
path
would
look
like
if
it
used
the
nodes
that
were
the
most
connected
.
I
can
use
this
command
to
see
the
number
of
connections
:
and
I
can
get
the
number
of
edges
","
but
I'm
not
sure
how
to
apply
this
to
list
as
a
path
.
For
example
","
I
can
add
this
number
as
an
attribute
but
I
don't
think
attributes
are
taken
into
consideration
when
finding
a
path
and
because
I'm
adding
this
after
the
edges
are
connected
","
I
cannot
add
the
weights
to
the
edges
themselves
.
The
other
problem
is
the
higher
the
score
the
more
I
want
the
path
to
be
followed
but
with
edges
I
think
it
follows
the
lowest
weighted
edge
.
I'm
wondering
what
approach
do
other
people
take
to
find
paths
based
on
certain
characteristics
of
the
node
?
If
someone
knows
how
to
do
this
for
networkx
","
great
!
but
I
think
networkx
has
many
features
so
if
I
can
get
the
theory
or
general
approach
I'm
sure
I
can
find
a
way
to
do
it
in
python
.
UPDATE
:
Sorry
I
might
be
explaining
it
wrong
.
I
understand
I
can
add
attributes
to
nodes
","
but
I'm
not
sure
how
to
make
path
decisions
based
on
those
attributes
.
So
in
my
case
","
based
on
certain
conditions
I
am
adding
edges
between
nodes
.
Each
group
of
nodes
represents
a
different
"day(day1data.., day2data.., day3data..)"
","
so
I'm
connecting
a
few
nodes
from
day1
to
nodes
on
day2
only
if
certain
rules
are
matched
.
Once
I
have
the
edges
connected
","
I
want
those
ones
to
be
considered
more
heavily
when
choosing
a
path
.
So
I
added
an
attribute
'
weight
'
to
each
node
of
the
current
day
which
is
basically
the
total
number
of
edges
connecting
that
node
.
My
problem
is
","
the
weight
attribute
is
not
used
in
any
of
the
path
decision
making
because
its
an
attribute
I
created
and
labeled
myself(I could create a label named 'abc'='hello world' and it would apply that attribute to the node)
.
How
can
I
get
this
weight
to
be
considered
when
creating
the
path(the edges are already created so I don't think I can go back and recreate them)
?
