I
would
like
to
find
out
if
a
particular
python
datetime
object
is
older
than
X
hours
or
minutes
.
I
am
trying
to
do
something
similar
to
:
This
generates
a
type
error
.
What
is
the
proper
way
to
do
date
time
comparison
in
python
?
I
already
looked
at
WorkingWithTime
which
is
close
but
not
exactly
what
I
want
.
I
assume
I
just
want
the
datetime
object
represented
in
seconds
so
that
I
can
do
a
normal
int
comparison
.
Please
post
lists
of
datetime
best
practices
.
