I
have
Dronekit
working
properly
with
SITL
sim
","
however
for
my
project
I
want
to
be
able
to
command
the
attitude
of
the
copter
.
Obviously
I
can
do
this
via
RC
over
ride
in
ALT_HOLD
mode
","
however
I
don't
like
that
approach
.
I
have
been
trying
to
use
the
Mavlink
message
SET_ATTITUDE_TARGET
(
#
82
)
","
however
when
I
send
the
messages
to
the
sim
","
nothing
happens
.
I
have
been
able
to
set
the
velocity
and
the
position
","
and
those
work
fine
.
Here
is
my
function
:
Can
someone
help
me
out
?
