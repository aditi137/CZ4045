Putting
your
customized
templates
in
templates
/
registration
(
not
register
)
should
work
.
At
least
if
your
TEMPLATES
setting
is
correctly
configured
:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/templates/upgrading/
And
you
probably
already
checked
this
hint
from
the
project's
FAQ
?
I
want
to
use
custom
templates
","
but
django
keeps
using
the
admin
templates
instead
of
mine
!
To
fix
this
","
make
sure
that
in
the
INSTALLED_APPS
of
your
settings.py
the
entry
for
the
registration
app
is
placed
above
django.contrib.admin
.
