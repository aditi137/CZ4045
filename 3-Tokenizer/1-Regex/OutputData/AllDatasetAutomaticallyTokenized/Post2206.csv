Thanks
everyone
","
the
remove-a-column
trick
is
exactly
what
I
needed
.
The
particular
structure
of
my
example
","
particularly
it
not
having
full
rank
","
is
representative
of
the
class
of
problems
I'm
working
on
.
Knowing
one
of
the
variables
makes
these
problems
analytically
solvable
with
a
unique
solution
","
the
remove-a-column
trick
lets
me
successfully
find
that
solution
using
numpy.linalg.solve
","
so
my
question
was
answered
.
