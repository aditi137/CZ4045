It
turns
out
this
is
cause
by
the
Content-Type
setting
:
On
the
BaseHandler
:
But
actually
in
the
request
header
:
'
Content-Type
'
:
'
application
/
json
;
charset=utf-8
'
This
string
doesn't
match
at
all
.
But
even
after
setting
the
Content-Type
=
""""
application
/
json
""""
from
the
client
","
the
string
appended
""""
;
charset=utf-8
""""
again
.
The
only
way
I
fixed
this
is
change
the
basehandler
code
to
:
It
fixed
my
problem
.
But
still
","
anybody
know
where
""""
charset=utf-8
""""
come
from
?
Is
it
automatically
set
up
by
AFNetworking
?
Thanks
!
