As
@zacherates
says
","
you
really
don't
want
to
display
a
stacktrace
to
your
users
.
The
easiest
approach
to
this
problem
is
what
Django
does
by
default
if
you
have
yourself
and
your
developers
listed
in
the
ADMINS
setting
with
email
addresses
;
it
sends
an
email
to
everyone
in
that
list
with
the
full
stack
trace
(
and
more
)
everytime
there
is
a
500
error
with
DEBUG
=
False
.
