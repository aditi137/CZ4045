I'm
using
lxml
on
Python
2.7
.
Given
a
node
","
node
and
a
child
","
child_element
","
what
is
the
difference
between
these
:
node.xpath('./child_element')
"node.xpath(""*[local-name()"
=
'
child_element
'
]
""""
)
In
other
words
","
what's
going
on
under
the
hood
here
?
Is
there
any
reason
one
ought
to
be
""""
better
""""
than
another
(
in
terms
of
performance
or
correctness
)
?
I've
read
through
the
lxml
docs
and
a
good
deal
of
other
XPath
query
resources
and
am
not
finding
any
real
clarification
.
