I
think
your
best
bet
would
be
to
install
fabric
and
rsync_project
on
'
bastion
'
and
use
fabrics
""""
run
""""
to
call
rsync_project
on
bastion
.
Another
option
would
be
to
use
""""
get
""""
to
receive
a
copy
from
bastion
and
run
rsync_project
locally
.
But
this
approach
will
not
match
your
picture
.
