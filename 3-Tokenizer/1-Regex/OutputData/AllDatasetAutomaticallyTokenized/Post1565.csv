I
am
taking
zip
file
as
input
which
contains
multiple
files
and
folders
","
I
am
extracting
it
and
then
I
want
to
change
the
last
modified
time
of
each
content
in
zip
to
some
new
date
and
time
set
by
user
.
I
am
using
os.utime()
to
change
the
date
and
time
","
but
changes
get
reflected
only
to
the
files
and
not
to
the
folders
inside
zip
.
I
am
using
Python
2.7
as
platform
