If
I've
understood
correctly
you're
looking
for
this
type
of
solution
:
This
solution
won't
work
with
some
software
like
IDLE
","
Sublime
Text
","
Eclipse
...
The
problem
with
running
it
within
this
type
of
software
is
that
clear
/
cls
uses
ANSI
escape
sequences
to
clear
the
screen
.
These
commands
write
a
string
such
as
""""
\
033
[
[
80;j
""""
to
the
output
buffer
.
The
native
command
prompt
is
able
to
interpret
this
as
a
command
to
clear
the
screen
but
these
pseudo-terminals
don't
know
how
to
interpret
it
","
so
they
just
end
up
printing
small
square
as
if
printing
an
unknown
character
.
If
you're
using
this
type
of
software
","
one
hack
around
could
be
doing
print('\n' * 100)
","
it
won't
be
the
optimal
solution
but
it's
better
than
nothing
.
