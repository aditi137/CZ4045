I
am
trying
to
modify
a
Python
script
I
wrote
for
Python
64bit
2.7
to
use
it
with
Python
64bit
3.4.3.6
.
This
program
is
using
from
win32com.client
import Dispatch
.
When
running
it
with
Python
64bit
2.7
it
works
perfectly
well
","
but
with
Python
64bit
3.4
I
have
the
following
error
:
So
I
checked
in
WinPython-64bit-3.4.3.6\python-3.4.3.amd64\Lib\site-packages
and
there
are
three
folders
:
\
win32
","
\
win32com
and
\
win32comext
.
I
was
able
to
find
a
file
called
win32api.pyd
in
\
win32
.
NB
:
I
found
similar
topics
but
none
of
them
really
answered
the
problem
.
