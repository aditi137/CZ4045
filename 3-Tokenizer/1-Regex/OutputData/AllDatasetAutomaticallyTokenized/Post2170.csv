I
was
wondering
if
there
is
an
easy
way
to
create
a
grid
of
checkboxes
using
Tkinter
.
I
am
trying
to
make
a
grid
of
10
rows
and
columns
(
so
100
checkboxes
)
so
that
only
two
checkboxes
can
be
selected
per
row
.
Edit
:
I'm
using
python
2.7
with
spyder
What
I
have
so
far
:
I'm
trying
to
use
state='Disabled
'
to
grey
out
a
row
once
two
checkboxes
have
been
selected
.
