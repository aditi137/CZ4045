how
about
using
a
dictionary
?
however
","
you
must
ensure
there
are
no
duplicate
match_objects
dictionary
keys
(
mo_foo
","
mo_bar
","
...
)
","
best
by
giving
each
regular
expression
its
own
name
and
naming
the
match_objects
keys
accordingly
","
otherwise
match_objects.setdefault()
method
would
return
existing
match
object
instead
of
creating
new
match
object
by
running
re_xxx.search( text )
.
