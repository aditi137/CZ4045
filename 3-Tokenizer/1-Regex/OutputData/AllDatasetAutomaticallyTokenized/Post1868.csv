You
need
a
queue
that
is
shared
between
processes
.
One
process
adds
to
the
queue
","
the
other
processes
from
the
queue
.
Here
is
a
simplified
example
:
If
you
want
to
only
process
10
things
at
a
time
","
you
can
limit
the
queue
size
to
10
.
This
means
","
the
""""
writer
""""
cannot
write
anything
until
if
the
queue
already
has
10
items
waiting
to
be
processed
.
By
default
","
the
queue
has
no
bounds
/
limits
.
The
documentation
is
a
good
place
to
start
for
more
on
queues
.
