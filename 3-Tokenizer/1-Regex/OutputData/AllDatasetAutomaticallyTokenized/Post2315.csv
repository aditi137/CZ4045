I
have
a
nested
list
.
For
example
:
Now
I
want
to
sort
the
numbers
within
the
sub-lists
into
descending
order
and
finally
arrange
the
nested
list
into
alphabetical
order
in
Python
3
.
So
output
data
should
be
:
where
numbers
in
Rhys
","
Sam
","
Tom
and
Tommo
have
been
reordered
into
descending
order
.
