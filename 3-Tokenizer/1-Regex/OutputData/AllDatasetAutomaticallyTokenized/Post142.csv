You
might
also
try
:
Using
a
single
carriage
return
at
the
beginning
of
your
string
rather
than
several
backspaces
.
Your
cursor
will
still
blink
","
but
it'll
blink
after
the
percent
sign
rather
than
under
the
first
digit
","
and
with
one
control
character
instead
of
three
you
may
get
less
flicker
.
