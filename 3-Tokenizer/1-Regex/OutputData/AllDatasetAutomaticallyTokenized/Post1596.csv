You
should
investigate
Java
serialization
To
serialize
an
object
means
to
convert
its
state
to
a
byte
stream
so
that
the
byte
stream
can
be
reverted
back
into
a
copy
of
the
object
.
A
Java
object
is
serializable
if
its
class
or
any
of
its
superclasses
implements
either
the
java.io.Serializable
interface
or
its
subinterface
","
java.io.Externalizable
.
Deserialization
is
the
process
of
converting
the
serialized
form
of
an
object
back
into
a
copy
of
the
object
.
Java
can
serialize
natively
to
a
byte
stream
.
That
bytestream
can
be
a
file
","
a
network
stream
etc.
Additionally
a
number
of
3rd
party
libraries
exist
to
serialise
to
XML
","
JSON
etc.
