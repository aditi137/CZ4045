In
Sphinx
projects
","
the
presentation
of
the
HTML
page
is
controlled
using
a
template
language
(
Jinja2
by
default
)
.
So
you
can
make
your
pages
more
interactive
by
adding
Javascript
to
the
HTML
template
file(s)
and
it
will
get
inserted
when
Sphinx
uses
that
particular
template
file
to
render
a
page
.
Locate
your
templates
directory
by
searching
for
templates_path
in
your
conf.py
Jinja
templates
can
extend
one
another
","
so
you
probably
want
the
file
that
begins
with
{
%
extends
""""
basic
/
layout.html
""""
%
}
.
Once
you
track
down
where
in
the
sequence
of
extension
you
want
to
make
your
change
","
you
need
to
combine
:
The
section
of
the
page
where
you
want
this
to
take
effect
(
typically
the
main
block
)
the
CSS
with
a
class
for
code
blocks
(
eg
.
in
mine
it's
class=highlight
)
.
The
.
CSS
file
might
well
be
in
docs
/
source
/
_static
/
A
javascript
snippet
to
create
the
button
and
write
to
the
clipboard
(
eg
.
https://clipboardjs.com/
)
Next
","
build
the
Sphinx
project
locally
(
make
html
)
until
you
have
it
dialed
in
and
the
import to
readthedocs
.
