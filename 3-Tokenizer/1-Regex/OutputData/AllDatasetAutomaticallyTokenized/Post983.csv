I
often
find
myself
wanting
to
use
a
3rd
party
python
module
in
my
own
project
","
but
I
know
that
I
will
also
need
to
make
changes
to
the
3rd
party
module
that
I
want
to
push
upstream
.
What
is
the
best
practice
of
file
layout
/
installation
to
achieve
this
?
Most
python
modules
are
laid
out
with
root
dir
containing
a
""""
setup.py
""""
to
compile
/
install
the
module
.
The
problem
is
","
every
time
I
make
changes
to
the
module
source
I
need
to
re-run
the
full
install
step
in
order
to
use
those
changes
in
my
project
.
For
large
modules
","
like
scipy
this
can
take
some
time
.
Alternatively
","
I
can
hack
on
the
installed
version
of
the
python
module
","
but
then
I
have
to
manually
move
those
changes
back
to
the
source
version
of
the
module
in
order
to
generate
patches
etc.
I
know
about
virtualenv
and
PYTHONPATH
but
they
are
ways
of
installing
a
module
to
a
different
location
.
So
far
","
I
have
manually
created
symlinks
","
but
that
is
messy
.
