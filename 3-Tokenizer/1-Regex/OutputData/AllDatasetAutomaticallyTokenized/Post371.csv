Starting
from
python
2.6
you
can
also
use
NamedTemporaryFile
with
the
delete
=
option
set
to
False
.
This
way
the
temporary
file
will
be
accessible
","
even
after
you
close
it
.
Note
that
on
Windows
(
NT
and
later
)
you
cannot
access
the
file
a
second
time
while
it
is
still
open
.
You
have
to
close
it
before
you
can
copy
it
.
This
is
not
true
on
Unix
systems
.
