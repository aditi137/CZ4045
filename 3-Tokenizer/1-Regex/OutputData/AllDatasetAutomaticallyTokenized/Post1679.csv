Given
you
want
to
establish
http://example.com/sitemap.xml
as
your
sitemap
URL
do
that
.
Add
this
line
to
init.py
to
register
URL
pattern
http://example.com/sitemap.xml
as
route
sitemap
register
view
code
for
route
sitemap
and
render
response
with
your
custom
jinja2
template
sitemap.jinja2
.
The
file
extension
`
jinja2
'
will
trigger
usage
of
jinja2
renderer
.
This
will
fix
your
errors
resulting
from
trying
to
name
your
templates
like
URLs
.
But
that
mixed
up
renderer
conventions
shown
below
.
*
.
pt
triggers
Chameleon
renderer
*
.
jinja2
triggers
Jinja2
renderer
*
.
mako
triggers
Mako
renderer
*
.
xml
triggers
XML
renderer
(
that
raised
your
first
error
)
Now
it
is
still
up
to
you
to
create
XML
based
on
sitemaps
protocol
.
But
your
code
looks
promising
.
You
pass
your
resource
tree
to
the
XML
template
.
Every
resource
usually
has
access
to
their
properties
like
URL
or
last_changed
stuff
.
