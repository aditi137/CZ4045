I
am
trying
to
write
an
Go_nogo
Task
in
Psychopy
.
Even
though
I
managed
to
write
a
script
which
is
working
","
there
are
still
a
few
things
that
make
troubles
.
First
","
I
present
pictures
of
emotional
stimuli
(
im_n
","
neural
;
im_a
","
emotional
)
and
people
should
only
answer
by
pressing
""""
space
""""
if
neutral
emotional
pictures
are
presented
.
When
I
run
the
code
below
everything
works
well
until
I
don't
press
any
key
or
the
wrong
key
.
So
my
question
is
","
how
do
I
have
to
write
the
code
that
I
don't
get
kicked
out
of
the
run
while
not
answering
...
?
Thanks
everybody
!
I
get
the
error
message
:
