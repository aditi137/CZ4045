I
am
trying
to
execute
this
query
with
psycopg2
in
Python3
:
And
I
am
getting
this
error
message
:
syntax
error
at
or
near
""""
'
my_new_database
'
""""
LINE
1
:
CREATE
DATABASE
(
'
my_new_database
'
)
WITH
TEMPLATE
'
original
...
On
the
other
hand
","
this
query
works
without
any
problem
:
Why
the
second
one
has
not
syntax
errors
and
the
first
one
yes
?
I
tried
to
remove
parenthesis
in
the
first
one
and
then
the
problem
is
the
quotes
...
Anyone
knows
what
is
happening
?
