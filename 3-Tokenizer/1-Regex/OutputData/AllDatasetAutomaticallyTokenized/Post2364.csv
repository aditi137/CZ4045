I'm
trying
to
parse
a
text
document
with
data
in
the
following
format
:
24036
-
977
.
I
need
to
separate
the
numbers
into
separate
values
","
and
the
way
I've
done
that
is
with
the
following
steps
.
This
does
the
job
","
however
I
was
curious
about
why
using
(
.
*
?
)
in
the
second
group
causes
the
regex
to
fail
?
I
tested
it
in
the
online
regex
tester(https://regex101.com/r/bM2nK1/1)
","
and
adding
the
?
in
causes
the
second
group
to
return
nothing
.
Now
as
far
as
I
know
.
*
?
means
to
take
any
value
unlimited
times
","
as
few
times
as
possible
","
and
the
.
*
is
just
the
greedy
version
of
that
.
What
I'm
confused
about
is
why
the
non
greedy
version
.
*
?
takes
that
definition
to
mean
capturing
nothing
?
