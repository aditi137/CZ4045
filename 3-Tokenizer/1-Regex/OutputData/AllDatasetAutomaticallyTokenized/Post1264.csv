I
am
writing
a
simple
text
based
adventure
game
in
python
.
I
will
include
all
of
the
code
because
I
have
no
idea
what
the
problem
is
(
it
isn't
too
long
and
it's
quite
simple
)
.
In
order
to
save
","
I
am
writing
to
a
text
file
the
name
of
the
'
currentRoom
'
and
each
item
in
'
you.inventory
'
.
Then
when
I
load
I
am
using
'
readline()
'
to
retrieve
that
data
and
reset
the
variables
.
I've
got
a
""""
game
loop
""""
where
I
get
the
next
command
and
perform
whatever
function
matches
the
command
.
When
I
wrote
the
following
code
for
'
load
'
","
it
wouldn't
work
correctly
.
To
test
the
save
/
load
","
I
start
the
game
pick
up
a
few
items
and
then
go
north
to
get
into
a
position
that
is
not
the
starting
room
","
and
save
.
Then
I
quit
","
run
the
game
again
","
enter
the
same
name
of
course
","
and
then
give
command
'
load
'
.
Note
","
the
saved
file
is
correct
.
I
even
included
a
print
statement
in
the
load
function
that
prints
currentRoom.name
","
and
it's
correct
","
but
then
when
I
call
the
look
function
and
it
does
the
exact
same
'
print
currentRoom.name
'
","
I've
been
moved
back
to
the
starting
room
!
?
Interestingly
","
the
inventory
is
loaded
fine
","
just
the
location
is
wrong
.
I
can't
figure
it
out
for
the
life
of
me
.
In
order
to
fix
this
","
I
had
to
move
the
load()
function
into
the
game
loop
body
","
under
'
elif
com
=
=
""""
load
""""
...
","
rather
than
calling
it
as
a
function
","
and
then
it
works
!
?
I
suspect
I'm
doing
something
wrong
with
global
vs
local
variables
","
but
I
can't
see
what
.
Here's
the
code
:
(
sorry
for
the
indentation
errors
","
cut
and
paste
didn't
work
well
)
