I
like
wxPython
or
Tk
.
Tk
comes
with
the
standard
Python
distribution
so
you
don't
need
install
anything
else
.
wxPython
(
wxWigets
)
seems
much
more
powerful
and
looks
a
lot
nicer
.
It
also
works
well
cross-platform
(
though
not
perfectly
because
it
uses
different
underlying
graphic
API's
on
diff
system
types
)
