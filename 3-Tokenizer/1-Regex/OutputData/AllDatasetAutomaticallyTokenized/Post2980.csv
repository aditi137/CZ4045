I'm
using
a
python
script
to
import and
export
wavefront
obj
files
in
Blender
.
The
problem
is
that
Blender
adds
an
index
to
an
object's
name
if
an
object
with
the
same
name
was
already
added
.
For
example
myObject
becomes
myObject.001
if
there
was
already
an
object
called
myObject
added
in
the
past
(
even
if
said
object
was
removed
)
.
When
I
export
the
object
as
.
obj
the
names
are
no
longer
the
same
as
before
.
How
do
I
reset
that
""""
name-counter
""""
?
