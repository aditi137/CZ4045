I
like
your
way
","
it
is
explicit
","
the
for
loop
is
understandable
by
all
and
it
isn't
all
that
slow
compared
to
other
approaches
.
Some
suggestions
I'd
make
would
be
to
change
your
condition
from
if
c
!
=
b
'
'
to
if
c
since
a
non-empty
byte
object
will
be
truthy
and
","
*
don't
name
your
list
bytes
","
you
mask
the
built-in
!
Name
it
bt
or
something
similar
:
-
)
Other
options
include
itertools.takewhile
which
will
grab
elements
from
an
iterable
as
long
as
a
predicate
holds
;
your
operation
would
look
like
:
This
is
slightly
slower
but
is
more
compact
","
if
you're
a
one-liner
lover
this
might
appeal
to
you
.
Slightly
faster
and
also
compact
is
using
index
along
with
a
slice
:
While
compact
it
also
suffers
from
readability
.
In
short
","
I'd
go
with
the
for
loop
since
readability
counts
as
very
pythonic
in
my
eyes
.
