Short
answer
:
if
you
have
some
gigabytes
of
RAM
","
use
Python
dictionaries
","
it's
the
easiest
way
to
implement
(
and
probably
the
faster
to
run
)
.
You
can
do
something
like
this
:
And
then
check
if
the
key
exists
in
the
mapping
:
Long
answer
:
you
can
use
a
persistent
key-value
store
","
like
GDBM
(
it
looks
like
Berkeley
DB
)
or
another
kind
of
database
-
-
but
this
approach
will
be
way
slower
than
using
just
Python
dictionaries
;
on
the
other
hand
","
with
this
approach
you'll
have
persistance
(
if
you
need
)
.
You
can
understand
GDBM
as
a
dictionary
(
key-value
store
)
that
is
persisted
in
a
single
file
.
You
can
use
it
as
follows
:
Then
the
file
my.db
will
be
created
(
see
Python
GDBM
documentation
to
understand
what
cf
means
)
.
But
it
has
some
limitations
","
as
supporting
only
strings
as
keys
and
values
:
You
can
populate
a
gdbm
database
with
all
your
keys
having
a
dummy
value
:
And
then
check
if
the
key
exists
in
the
mapping
:
