is
a
rather
visionary
language
","
and
not
yet
anywhere
nearly
stable
enough
for
production
.
But
it
has
a
set
of
very
cool
features
","
among
them
:
junctions
","
grammars
(
yes
","
you
can
write
full
parsers
with
Perl
6
""""
regexes
""""
)
","
unicode
handling
at
the
grapheme
level
","
lazy
lists
and
powerful
macros
.
In
your
particular
case
when
you
know
Perl
5

get
familiar
with
the
Perl
6
syntax
very
quickly
.
