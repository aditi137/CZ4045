One
of
my
specific
reasons
for
scraping
with
Selenium
is
to
make
sure
the
javascript
created
parts
of
each
page
are
fully
rendered
before
I
start
searching
for
content
.
I
use
this
line
to
wait
for
the
content
I
want
to
be
loaded
:
The
'
30
'
is
a
30
second
wait
timer
","
if
this
is
exceeded
then
a
TimeoutException
occurs
so
you
will
want
to
put
it
in
a
try
...
except
:
block
.
Change
my_xpath
to
match
the
tags
you
want
.
Even
if
the
style
is
marked
as
hidden
","
Selenium
can
still
see
it
.
