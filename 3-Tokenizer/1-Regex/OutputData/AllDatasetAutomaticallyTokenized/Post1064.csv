I
have
both
32
and
64
bit
python
and
ipython
using
WinPython
","
I
wanted
both
32
and
64
bit
versions
to
point
to
the
same
working
directory
for
ipython
notebook
.
I
followed
the
above
suggestions
here
I
was
still
unable
to
get
my
setup
working
.
Here's
what
I
did
-
in
case
anyone
needs
it
:
It
looks
like
Ipython
notebook
was
using
the
configuration
from
C:\pythonPath\winpythonPath\settings\.ipython\profile_default
Even

ipython
locate
returns
C:\users\Username\.ipython
As
a
result
","
modifying
the
ipython_notebook_config.py
file
did
nothing
to
change
my
working
directory
.
Additionally
ipython
profile_create
was
not
creating
the
needed
python
files
in
C:\pythonPath\winpythonPath\settings\.ipython\profile_default
I'm
sure
there's
a
better
way
","
but
to
resolve
this
quickly
","
I
copied
the
edited
python
files
from
C:\users\Username\.ipython\profile_default
to
C:\pythonPath\winpythonPath\settings\.ipython\profile_default
Now
(
finally
)
ipython
notebook
64
bit
runs
and
provides
me
the
correct
working
directory
Note
on
Windows
I'm
having
no
issue
with
the
following
syntax
:
