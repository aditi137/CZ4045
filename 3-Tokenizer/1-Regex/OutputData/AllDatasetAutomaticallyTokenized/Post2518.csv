To
solve
this
","
I
did
the
following
:
(
note
that
it
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me
which
of
these
solved
the
problem
","
since
I
didn't
test
thoroughly
)
.
1
)
Installed
python
at
Python.org
instead
of
Mac's
stupid
version
2
)
re-installed
all
of
the
modules
like
numpy
","
scipy
","
matplotlib
","
sklearn
and
ran
this:hash
-
r
python
according
to
this
source
:
Symbol
not
found
:
__PyCodecInfo_GetIncrementalDecoder
","
because
it
doesn't
make
python
use
the
cached
versions
of
the
modules
.
3
)
Then
","
I
realized
that
I
had
this
issue
:
https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/5093.
To
solve
it
","
I
had
to
make
sure
I
installed
the
scipy
module
using
python
-
m
pip
install
scipy='0.15.0
'
instead
of
just
pip
install
scipy='0.15.0
'
","
because
this
solved
the
issue
based
on
this
source
:
Can't
load
Python
modules
installed
via
pip
from
site-packages
directory
.
So
","
in
conclusion
it
turns
out
there
really
is
a
big
different
between
what
is
installed
by
pip
","
and
what
is
imported
when
python
is
executed
from
the
terminal
.
So
","
to
ensure
that
you
are
using
the
pip
to
install
the
modules
into
a
particular
python
","
you
can
use
python
-
m
pip
install
<
package
name
>
.
