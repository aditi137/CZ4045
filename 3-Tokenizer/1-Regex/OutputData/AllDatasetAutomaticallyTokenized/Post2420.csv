I
have
just
started
dealing
with
pyalgotrade
","
but
I
think
you're
doing
a
rather
simple
mistake
(
as
indicated
by
gzc
)
:
an
instance
of
class
Bars
is
a
collection
of
bars
from
different
instruments
that
all
have
the
same
timestamp
.
So
","
when
your
onBars
event
is
called
","
you
actually
have
to
loop
through
all
the
instruments
in
the
dictionary
.
