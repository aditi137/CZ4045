I've
used
Tkinter
and
wxPython
.
Tkinter
is
quite
basic
","
and
doesn't
use
native
widgets
.
This
means
that
Tkinter
applications
will
look
the
same
on
any
platform
–
this
might
sound
appealing
","
but
in
practice
","
it
means
they
look
ugly
on
any
platform
:
-
/
Nevertheless
","
it's
pretty
easy
to
use
.
I
found
Thinking
in
Tkinter
very
helpful
when
I
was
learning
","
because
I'd
never
done
any
GUI
programming
before
.
If
things
like
frames
and
layout
algorithms
and
buttons
and
bindings
are
familiar
to
you
","
though
","
you
can
skip
that
step
.
You
can
augment
Tkinter
with
Tix
(
but
be
warned
","
Tix
doesn't
play
well
with
py2exe
)
.
Also
check
out
Python
Megawidgets
","
which
builds
some
more
advanced
controls
using
the
Tkinter
basics
.
Finally
","
Tkinter
plays
nice
with
the
shell
:
you
can
start
the
interpreter
","
do
things
like
'
import tkinter
'
'
tk
=
tkinter.Tk()
'
etc.
and
build
your
GUI
interactively
(
and
it
will
be
responsive
)
.
(
I
think
this
doesn't
work
if
you
use
IDLE
","
though
)
wxPython
is
much
better
looking
","
and
ships
with
a
much
greater
range
of
controls
.
It's
cross-platform
(
though
it
seems
a
bit
finicky
on
my
Mac
)
and
uses
native
controls
on
each
platform
.
It's
a
bit
confusing
","
though
.
It
also
ships
with
a
demo
application
that
shows
off
most
of
its
features
","
and
provides
a
test-bed
for
you
to
experiment
.
Some
specific
thoughts
on
wxPython
:
There
are
three
(
?
)
different
ways
to
lay
widgets
out
.
Ignore
two
of
them
;
just
use
Sizers
.
And
even
then
","
you
can
do
just
about
any
layout
using
only
BoxSizer
and
GridBagSizer
.
All
wx
widgets
have
IDs
.
You
don't
need
to
care
what
the
IDs
are
","
but
in
the
old
days
(
I
think
)
you
did
need
to
know
","
so
some
old
code
will
be
littered
with
explicit
ID
assignments
.
And
most
demo
code
will
have
-
1
everywhere
as
the
ID
parameter
(
despite
the
fact
that
the
methods
all
have
ID
as
a
keyword
parameter
that
defaults
to
-
1
anyway
)
.
Make
sure
you
get
the
standard
wxWidgets
docs
as
well
as
the
wxPython
Demo
–
you
need
them
both
.
If
you
want
to
use
wxPython
with
py2exe
and
you
want
it
to
look
good
on
Windows
XP
","
you
need
a
bit
of
trickery
in
your
setup.py
.
