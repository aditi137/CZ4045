I
have
an
app
on
heroku
named
as
floating-river-39482
.
And
I'm
trying
to
deploy
the
app
by
giving
the
command
git
push
heroku
master
.
But
I
got
an
error
from
terminal
like
this
In
this
error
message
the
name
of
the
app
is
sleepy-inlet-36834
.
But
I'm
trying
to
push
the
app
floating-river-39482
.
I
don't
have
an
app
named

.
How
can
I
correct
this
error
?
