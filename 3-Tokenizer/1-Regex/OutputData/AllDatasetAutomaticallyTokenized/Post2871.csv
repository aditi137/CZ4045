I'm
learning
python
these
days
","
and
I
have
a
rather
basic
question
.
There's
a
remote
server
where
a
webserver
is
listening
in
on
incoming
traffic
.
If
I
enter
a
uri
like
the
following
in
my
browser
","
it
performs
certain
processing
on
some
files
for
me
:
My
rather
basic
question
is
:
how
can
I
achieve
sending
the
above
dynamic
parameters
(
i.e.
container
=
container_name
and
video
=
video_name
)
to
223.58.1.10:8000
/
processVideo
via
a
python
script
?
I've
seen
ways
to
ping
an
IP
","
but
my
requirements
are
more
than
that
.
Guidance
from
experts
will
be
very
helpful
.
Thanks
!
