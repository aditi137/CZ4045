You
just
need
to
rstrip
the
newline
from
each
line
of
the
first
file
so
you
don't
compare
dog\n
with
red
","
dog\n
","
the
newline
on
the
string
you
are
testing
is
irrelevant
.
You
can
also
use
zip
and
read
the
files
line
by
line
withput
the
need
for
readlines
and
indexing
:
If
you
want
exact
matches
then
you
will
need
to
rstrip
and
split
on
the
comma
:
The
difference
on
splitting
would
mean
dog
would
not
match
dogs
","
cats
.
