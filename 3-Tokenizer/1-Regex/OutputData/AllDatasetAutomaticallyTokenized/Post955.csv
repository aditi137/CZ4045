not
enough
reputation
to
comment
yet
apparently
","
but
tim
stone's
answer
is
correct
.
suppose
we
have
a
function
like
this
:
now
in
order
to
perform
type
inference
","
there
has
to
be
at
least
one
call
to
blah
","
or
it
becomes
impossible
to
know
the
types
of
the
arguments
at
compile-time
.
for
a
stand-alone
program
","
this
not
a
problem
","
since
everything
that
has
to
be
compiled
for
it
to
run
is
called
indirectly
from
somewhere
.
.
for
an
extension
module
","
calls
can
come
from
the
'
outside
'
","
so
sometimes
we
have
to
add
a
'
fake
'
call
to
a
function
for
type
inference
to
become
possible
.
.
hence
the
'
if
False
'
.
in
the
shedskin
example
set
there
are
a
few
programs
that
are
compiled
as
extension
modules
","
in
order
to
be
combined
with
for
example
pygame
or
multiprocessing
.
