Installing
scientific
Python
modules
from
sources
on
Windows
is
a
bit
complex
and
not
very
maintainable
.
A
more
reliable
solution
is
to
use
a
scientific
python
distribution
","
such
as
Anaconda
or
Enthought
Canopy
.
Edit
:
I
understand
this
answer
is
opinion
based
","
however
I
am
not
aware
of
other
simple
and
open-source
way
to
deploy
scientific
python
modules
on
Windows
.
Sure
you
could
install
scipy
from
sources
or
with
pip
","
however
in
a
wider
picture
","
if
you
need
Numpy
","
Scipy
","
IPython
and
Matplotlib
","
etc.
that's
just
not
a
workable
solution
.
