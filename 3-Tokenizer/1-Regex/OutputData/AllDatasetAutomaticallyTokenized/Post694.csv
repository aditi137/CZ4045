Use
wx.aui.AuiManager.SavePerspective
and
wx.aui.AuiManager.LoadPerspective
to
load
and
save
layout
data
(
assuming
you
have
a
consistent
set
of
panes
when
you
load
as
you
had
when
you
saved
)
For
wxPython
SavePerspective
will
just
return
a
string
which
you
can
store
somewhere
and
then
pass
into
LoadPerspective
.
This
may
not
work
100
%
reliably
-
I've
had
a
number
of
problems
with
it
before
.

For
a
single
pane
in
a
manager
","
you
can
use
SavePaneInfo
and
LoadPaneInfo
on
the
wx.aui.AuiManager
