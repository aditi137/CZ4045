You
can
use
the
Flask
session
object
which
does
exactly
what
you
want
:
A
session
basically
makes
it
possible
to
remember
information
from
one
request
to
another
.
Also
","
a
session
is
basically
a
python
dictionary
where
you
can
store
info
between
requests
.
See
here
a
small
example
on
using
session
and
the
secret_key
which
it
requires
.
If
security
is
your
primary
concern
you
should
use
the
isdangerous
module
which
is
more
secure
than
the
default
werkzeug
session
.
Update
Another
possibility
is
to
use
server-side
sessions
to
store
the
session
data
in
the
database
.
There
is
even
an
extension
-
Flask-KVSession
-
which
stores
session
data
on
a
variety
of
backends
.
