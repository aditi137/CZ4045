I
have
searched
into
google
and
found
some
contradiction
.
Does
xlwt
support
xlsx
file
(
MS
office
2007
)
.
I
heard
that
xlwt
0.7.4
support
xlsx
file
.
Does
anyone
tried
xlsx
file
writing
operation
with
xlwt
0.7.4
The
purpose
of
this
question
is
","
I
do
not
have
permission
to
install
library
if
I
need
to
install
I
need
to
provide
more
detail
info
.
I
need
to
write
xlsx
file
in
python.So
if
anyone
has
done
similar
thing
it
will
help
to
provide
better
inforamtion
I
have
looked
into
this
wiki
page
.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt
But
did
not
find
that
it
support
xlsx
file
or
Should
I
use
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openpyxl
for
writing
xlsx
File
