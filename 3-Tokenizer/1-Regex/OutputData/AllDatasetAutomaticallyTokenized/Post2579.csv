I
am
currently
making
a
web
builder
where
it
will
generate
a
random
gif
based
on
the
GIPHY
API
.
I
am
having
a
problem
where
I
test
a
case
on
when
the
api
returns
with
0
results
.
while
not
flag
:
get_image_link(get_random_query()
)
Essentially
","
if
the
results
come
back
with
no
data
in
the
results
","
i
want
it
to
retry
the
function
to
grab
another
word
.
The
program
works
when
a
word
with
results
comes
back
but
when
it
comes
back
with
0
results
I
get
a
TypeError
and
it
doesn't
go
back
into
the
loop
.
I
am
sure
it
does
this
because
it
doesn't
break
out
of
the
function
and
instead
returns
a
[]
type
.
How
can
I
break
out
of
the
function
and
get
back
into
the
while
loop
so
I
can
generate
another
result
?
Thank
you
.
