I
have
a
ttk.Treeview
widget
with
some
rows
of
data
.
How
do
I
set
the
focus
to
and
select
(
highlight
)
a
specified
item
?
does
nothing
complains
that
:
Item
0
not
found
","
although
the
widget
is
plainly
populated
with
more
than
zero
items
.
Trying
item
1
does
no
better
.
EDIT
:
to
select
an
item
","
find
its
id
","
then
use
tree.selection_set(id)
.
Neither
tree.focus(id)
nor
tree.focus_set(id)
appears
to
do
anything
.
