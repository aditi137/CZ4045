I
am
trying
to
write
a
fab
file
which
will
do
the
auto
deployment
of
my
code
on
amazon
server
.
So
for
that
I
am
giving
the
SSH
connection
path
at
the
top
of
the
fabric
method
.
But
its
not
connecting
and
asking
for
password
.
I
have
the
.
pem
file
using
which
I
am
able
to
connect
successfully
from
my
Ubuntu
terminal
.
But
the
same
thing
is
not
working
when
I
am
trying
to
do
through
fabric
and
its
asking
for
password
.
Example
Code
snippet
of
my
fabric
file
.
Is
there
any
way
to
make
it
password
less
.
Thanks
