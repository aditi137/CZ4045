You
will
need
to
ensure
that
Django
itself
","
not
just
CMS
","
knows
the
app's
namespace
","
tv_article_hook
.
I
suspect
that
is
registered
with
CMS
","
but
not
a
namespace
which
Django
knows
about
.
Now
depending
on
what
version
of
Django
you're
using
there's
a
couple
of
ways
to
define
the
namespace
for
Django
.
But
have
a
read
of
the
application
docs
","
essentially
you
can
define
your
own
app
config
like
so
;
With
that
setup
","
you
should
then
be
able
to
modify
your
code
like
so
(
removing
'
_hook
'
from
your
CMS
namespace
as
well
because
thats
a
CMS
term
","
but
we're
just
talking
about
a
Django
app
here
)
