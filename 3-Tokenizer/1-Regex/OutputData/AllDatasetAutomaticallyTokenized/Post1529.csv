I
want
to
extract
certain
information
from
a
large
file
using
python
.
I
have
3
input
files
.
The
first
input
file
(
input_file
)
is
the
data
file
","
which
is
a
3-column
tab-separated
file
that
looks
like
this
:
The
second
input
file
(
colA_file
)
is
a
1-column
list
","
which
looks
like
this
:
The
third
input
file
(
colB_file
)
is
also
a
1-column
list
(
idential
to
colA_file
with
different
information
)
","
which
looks
like
this
:
I
want
to
extract
information
from
the
input
file
that
is
found
in
both
colA
and
colB
.
With
the
example
data
that
I
have
provided
","
this
would
mean
filtering
all
of
the
information
except
for
the
following
lines
:
I
have
written
the
following
code
in
Python
to
solve
this
task
:
However
","
it
only
outputs
1-line
","
as
if
it
is
not
iterating
over
the
list
inputs
provided
.
It
also
seems
that
my
lists
are
being
appended
upon
each
other
","
starting
with
one
item
and
incrementing
itself
with
each
appended
item
.
Thus
","
I
have
also
tried
to
reference
the
lists
as
follows
:
with
the
same
result
as
above
.
