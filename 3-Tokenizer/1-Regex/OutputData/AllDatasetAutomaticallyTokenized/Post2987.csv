Interactive
mode
or
Calculator
mode
","
is
an
interactive
mode
that
comes
with
python
.
If
you
have
installed
python
","
then
you
have
also
","
installed
something
called
the
Python
Shell
.
There
are
two
ways
you
can
access
the
Python
Shell
:
Typing
python
or
python
[
version-number
]
in
your
command
prompt
/
terminal
window
:
Assuming
that
you
have
python
in
your
PATH
variable
","
you
can
access
the
Python
Shell
by
simply
typing
python
or
python
[
version-number
]
in
your
command
prompt
/
terminal
window
.
Running
the
Python
Shell
in
the
Python
IDLE(Integrated Development Environment)
GUI
:
To
run
the
Python
Shell
in
the
Python
IDLE
GUI
","
you
can
"type(again i'm assuming that the path to your python installation folder, is in your PATH variable)"
","
just
type
idle
into
your
command
prompt\terminal
window
and
this
should
start
the
Python
Shell
in
the
Python
IDLE
GUI
.
Of
course
the
exact
text
for
the
Python
Shell
heading
will
vary
between
OS's
","
but
all
of
them
look
very
similar
.
Here
is
an
example
of
what
the
heading
appears
like
on
my
mac
:
As
you
might
can
tell
from
the
text
above
","
a
newline
in
the
Python
Shell
is
denoted
by
three
caret
symbols
:
>
>
>
.
Each
newline
","
a
new
three
carets
are
printed
.
When
using
Python
Shell
","
there
are
a
few
differences
","
then
just
typing
a
script
up
","
but
the
main
one
is
that
it
execute
your
code
line
by
line
.
In
the
Python
Shell
you
can
only
type
one
line
of
code
at
a
time
.
Here
is
an
example
to
illustrate
my
point
further
:
As
you
can
tell
from
the
above
program
","
indention
is
noted
by
three
dots
:
...
","
and
the
only
time
the
Python
Shell
shows
more
then
one
line
at
a
time
","
is
when
it
is
'
echoing
'
back
what
you
typed
in
.
Why
is
it
called
interactive
?
One
of
the
main
reason
its
called
interactive
is
that
to
display
variable
values
or
run
the
module
in
general
","
you
don't
have
to
explicitly
invoke
the
python
interpreter
.
Take
the
example
below
:
As
displayed
above
","
I
was
able
to
print
the
value
of
name
and
run
the
function
func()
without
having
to
use
a
print
command
or
explicitly
calling
the
python
interpreter
.
The
Python
Shell
is
not
really
a
practical
way
to
write
long
/
complex
programs
","
as
writing
code
__init__(see what i did there)
would
prove
to
be
cumbersome
and
awkward
.
A
better
choice
would
be
to
use
the
Python
IDLE
.
It
is
a
script
editor
for
python
that
comes
builtin
into
the
python
installation
package
.
Disclaimer
:
i
could
be
completely
wrong
about
this
.
I
am
simply
going
off
of
the
python
docs
and
my
own
experience
;

.
