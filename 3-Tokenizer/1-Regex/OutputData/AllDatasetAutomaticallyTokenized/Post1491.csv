I
have
2
django
models
-
main
(
product
)
and
linked
details
(
PhysicalProperty
are
many-to-many
link
through
additional
model
ProductMetricals
)
.
In
main
model
Product
I
wrote
the
post_save
reciever
","
where
I
check
and
clean
the
data
in
details
.
If
I
try
from
IDLE
","
it
works
fine
.
But
if
I
change
and
save
main
Product
in
Admin
form
","
I've
got
the
exception
I've
try
to
debug
it
","
but
steel
have
no
idea
-
why
Admin
raise
exception
?
Here
is
a
code
models.py
admin.py
If
I
create
the
some
property
","
create
product
","
add
a
one
property
to
product
","
then
change
the
name
of
product
and
save
it
-
I'v
got
the
exception
Exception
come
(
I
think
)
from
ProductMetricals.objects.filter( product = instance )
.
delete()
