I'm
using
a
base
folder
REF_IMAGES
where
I
keep
reference
bitmaps
for
a
specified
language
.
I
have
other
several
languages
folder
like
REF_IMAGES-EN
","
REF_IMAGES-NL
etc.
I
want
to
create
a
script
which
will
rename
the
base
folder
to
its
language
ie
.
REF_IMAGES-xx
and
after
rename
the
selected
language
folder
to
the
base
folder
name
.
To
do
this
I
have
a
created
a
txt
file
which
keeps
track
of
the
original
language
in
the
folder
.
My
code
is
the
following
:
However
I
get
the
following
error
while
trying
to
rename
image
folder
to
its
original
name
:
I
have
tried
several
several
Unlocker
programs
but
non
of
them
work
.
I
suppose
it
is
the
script
blocking
it
itself
but
I
can't
figure
out
what
.
Does
anyone
know
?
Regards
