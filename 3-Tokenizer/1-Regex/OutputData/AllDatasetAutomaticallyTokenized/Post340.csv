Use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
remove
unused
features
!
Definitely
go
with
the
new
language
.
Call
it
2.0
.
It
will
be
a
lot
less
work
to
rebuild
the
80
%
of
it
that
you
really
need
.
Start
by
wiping
your
brain
clean
of
the
whole
application
.
Sit
down
with
a
list
of
its
overall
goals
","
then
decide
which
features
are
needed
based
on
which
ones
are
used
.
Then
redesign
it
with
those
features
in
mind
","
and
build
.
(
I
love
to
delete
code
.
)
