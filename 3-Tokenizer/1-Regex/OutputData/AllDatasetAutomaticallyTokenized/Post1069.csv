Notice
you
are
not
only
working
with
1D
arrays
:
So
","
b
is
a
2D
array
.
You
also
see
this
in
the
output
of
b.shape
:
(
1
","
3
)
indicates
two
dimensions
as
(
3
","
)
is
one
dimension
.
The
behaviour
of
np.dot
is
different
for
1D
and
2D
arrays
(
from
the
docs
)
:
For
2-D
arrays
it
is
equivalent
to
matrix
multiplication
","
and
for
1-D
arrays
to
inner
product
of
vectors
That
is
the
reason
you
get
different
results
","
because
you
are
mixing
1D
and
2D
arrays
.
Since
b
is
a
2D
array
","
"np.dot(b, b)"
tries
a
matrix
multiplication
on
two
1x3
matrices
","
which
fails
.
With
1D
arrays
","
np.dot
does
a
inner
product
of
the
vectors
:
With
2D
arrays
","
it
is
a
matrix
multiplication
(
so
1x3
x
3x1
=
1x1
","
or
3x1
x
1x3
=
3x3
)
:
