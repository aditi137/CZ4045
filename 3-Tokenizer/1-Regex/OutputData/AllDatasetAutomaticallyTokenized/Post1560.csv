I
have
almost
completed
converting
a
pyGTK
application
to
pyQT4
.
One
of
the
last
aspects
I
am
struggling
with
is
generating
a
dialog
from
a
separate
thread
.
I
have
a
main
GUI
and
a
background
thread
.
On
the
offchance
of
thread-specific
issues
","
the
thread
generates
a
dialog
.
For
pyGTK
what
I
do
is
:
Called
as
:
"update_gui(gui_error,'help')"
Is
there
an
equivelent
in
pyQT4
or
do
I
need
to
gut
what
I
have
to
start
passing
signals
?
