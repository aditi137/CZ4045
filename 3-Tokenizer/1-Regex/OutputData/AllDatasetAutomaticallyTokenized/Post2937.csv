Iteratively
adding
rows
of
that
rank-1
using
"np.concatenate(a,b,axis=0)"
Don't
.
Creating
an
array
iteratively
is
slow
","
since
it
has
to
create
a
new
array
at
each
step
.
Plus
a
and
b
have
to
match
in
all
dimensions
except
the
concatenation
one
.
will
give
you
dimensions
error
.
The
only
thing
you
can
concatenate
to
such
an
array
is
an
array
with
size
0
dimenions
To
work
iteratively
","
start
with
a
empty
list
","
and
append
to
it
;
then
make
the
array
at
the
end
.
a
=
"np.zeros((1,1,1,1,1,0)"
)
could
be
concatenated
on
the
last
axis
with
another
"np.ones((1,1,1,1,1,n)"
)
array
.
