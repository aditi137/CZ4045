I
am
checking
consecutive
indices
of
a
list
and
I
want
to
execute
same
piece
of
code
in
case
if
the
consecutive
elements
are
not
equal
or
if
the
list
index
is
out
of
range
.
Here's
what
I'm
trying
Is
there
a
way
to
do
this
elegantly
without
having
to
repeat
the
same
code
in
the
except
block
somehow
?
