I've
been
working
on
a
event
based
AJAX
application
that
stores
recurring
events
in
the
a
table
in
the
following
format
(
Django
models
)
:
The
rec_type
stores
data
in
the
following
format
:
For
example
:
This
works
fine
","
and
allows
many
events
to
be
transmitted
concisely
","
but
I
now
have
the
requirement
to
extract
all
events
that
occur
during
a
given
range
.
For
example
on
a
specific
date
","
week
or
month
and
I
am
a
bit
lost
as
to
how
best
to
approach
.
In
particular
","
I
am
stuck
with
how
to
check
if
an
event
with
a
given
recurrence
pattern
is
eligible
to
be
in
the
results
.
What
is
the
best
approach
here
?
