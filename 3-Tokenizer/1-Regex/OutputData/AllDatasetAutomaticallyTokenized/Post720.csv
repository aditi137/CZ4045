What
I
ended
up
doing
was
as
follows
:
go
into
the
plone
/
app
/
registry
/
exportimport
/
configure.zcml
file
where
the
name
was
registered
as
:
Turns
out
the
name
of
the
import step
was
registered
as
'
plone.app.registry
'
So
basically
I
had
to
dig
into
the
code
to
find
out
where
the
importStep
was
registered
.
