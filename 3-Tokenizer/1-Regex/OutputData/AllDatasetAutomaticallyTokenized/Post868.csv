I
need
to
pick
some
numbers
out
of
some
text
files
.
I
can
pick
out
the
lines
I
need
with
grep
","
but
didn't
know
how
to
extract
the
numbers
from
the
lines
.
A
colleague
showed
me
how
to
do
this
from
bash
with
perl
:
However
","
I
usually
code
in
Python
","
not
Perl
.
So
my
question
is
","
could
I
have
used
Python
in
the
same
way
?
I.e
.
","
could
I
have
piped
something
from
bash
to
Python
and
then
gotten
the
result
straight
to
stdout
?
...
if
that
makes
sense
.
Or
is
Perl
just
more
convenient
in
this
case
?
