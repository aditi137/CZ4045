I'm
parsing
an
XML
file
with
some
coordinates
in
Python
to
write
a
transformed
output
file
.
The
problem
is
that
some
coordinates
are
-
0.00
and
I'm
having
some
problems
parsing
them
in
another
system
.
I
would
need
them
to
be
0.00
instead
of
-
0.00
.
How
could
I
achieve
such
thing
?
This
is
what
I'm
doing
so
far
:
