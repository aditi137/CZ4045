I
have
a
QMainWindow
app
consisting
of
a
Menu
Bar
","
Splitter
in
the
central
widget
","
and
a
status
bar
.
On
the
left
side
of
the
splitter
is
a
widget
containing
some
controls
(
list
","
combo
","
and
button
)
and
on
the
right
is
a
widget
containing
a
layout
of
Matplotlib
canvas
","
and
NavigationToolBar
.
I
was
able
to
use
QT
Stylesheets
to
set
the
various
background
colors
of
everything
...
except
the
Matplotlib
side
.
I
attempted
to
use
the
following
but
it
has
no
effect
.
I
also
tried
setting
the
NavBar
and
Canvas
stylesheets
directly
...
but
again
it
didn't
work
:
Basically
I
am
trying
to
turn
the
background
color
of
the
NavToolbar
and
the
border
around
the
canvas
to
match
everything
else
(
Currently
cyan
so
it
shows
up
easy
)
...
Any
help
would
be
appreciated
.
