Let
me
turn
your
question
on
its
head
by
asking
what
use
it
is
to
an
American
English
speaker
to
learn
another
language
?
The
languages
we
speak
(
and
those
we
program
in
)
inform
the
way
we
think
.
This
can
happen
on
a
fundamental
level
","
such
as
c
+
+
versus
javascript
versus
lisp
","
or
on
an
implementation
level
","
in
which
a
ruby
construct
provides
a
eureka
moment
for
a
solution
in
your
""""
real
job
.
""""
Speaking
of
your
real
job
","
if
the
market
goes
south
and
your
employer
decides
to
""""
right
size
""""
you
","
how
do
you
think
you'll
stack
up
against
a
guy
who
is
flexible
because
he's
written
software
in
tens
of
languages
","
instead
of
your
limited
exposure
?
All
things
being
equal
","
I
think
the
answer
is
clear
.
Finally
","
you
program
for
a
living
because
you
love
programming
...
right
?
