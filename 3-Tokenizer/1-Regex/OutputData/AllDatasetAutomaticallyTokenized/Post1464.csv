I
changed
from
the
old
datastore
API
to
NDB(a bit of a chore changing the code)
.
The
automatic
caching
seems
to
have
solved
the
problem
","
this
may
suggest
that
the
problem
was
with
my
code
","
but
still
doesn't
explain
why
everything
worked
fine
when
using
app
engine
1.7.5
and
not
with
1.7.6
.
I'll
remove
this
answer
if
anyone
has
an
alternative
","
just
thought
I'd
post
my
progress
in
case
anyone
else
is
having
the
same
problem
.
