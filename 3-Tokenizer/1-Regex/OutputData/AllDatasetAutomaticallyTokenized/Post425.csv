On
the
discussion
between
Jim
and
Thomas
Wouters
in
the
comments
.
The
issue
was
...
since
the
width
of
tabs
and
spaces
both
can
vary
-
-
and
since
programmers
can't
agree
on
either
width
-
-
why
is
it
that
tabs
bear
the
blame
.
I
agree
with
Jim
on
that
-
-
tabs
are
NOT
evil
in
and
of
themselves
.
But
there
is
a
problem
...
With
spaces
I
can
control
how
""""
MY
OWN
CODE
""""
looks
in
EVERY
editor
in
the
world
.
If
I
use
4
spaces
-
-
then
no
matter
what
editor
you
open
my
code
in
","
it
will
have
the
same
distance
from
the
left
margin
.
With
tabs
I
am
at
the
mercy
of
the
tab-width
setting
for
the
editor
-
-
even
for
MY
OWN
CODE
.
And
I
don't
like
that
.
So
while
it
is
true
that
even
spaces
can't
guarantee
consistency
-
-
they
at
least
afford
you
more
control
over
the
look
of
your
OWN
code
everywhere
-
-
something
that
tabs
can't
.
I
think
it's
NOT
the
consistency
in
the
programmers
writing
the
code
-
-
but
the
consistency
in
editors
showing
that
code
-
-
that
spaces
make
easier
to
achieve
(
and
impose
)
.
