Python
2.4.x
I
have
a
series
of
lines
that
I'm
reading
in
-
rearranging
and
then
making
each
line
into
a
list
which
is
nested
inside
another
list
.
I've
got
the
following
.
In
other
words
-
if
the
rec
being
passed
is
.
then
the
list
for
this
line
would
be
.
(
after
rearranging
)
.
(
this
list
would
get
appended
to
another
list
-
nested
lists
)
.
Which
it
does
fantastically
well
.
However
what
I'd
like
to
do
is
take
the
last
6
and
group
them
together
like
this
.
And
if
the
line
being
passed
does
not
have
28
elements
but
say
only
25
-
than
it
just
groups
whatever
beyond
the
22nd
element
-
(
the
text
is
not
the
same
line
after
line
)
.
i.e
the
above
example
has
28
elements
","
this
one
has
25
.
Lorem
ipsum
dolor
sit
amet
consectetur
adipiscing
elit
In
vitae
neque
nec
magna
tristique
ornare
Cras
faucibus
risus
eu
odio
pharetra
interdum
Nunc
dui
mi
and
the
resulting
list
would
be
:
Hope
that's
clear
-
any
ideas
?
Thank
you
.
