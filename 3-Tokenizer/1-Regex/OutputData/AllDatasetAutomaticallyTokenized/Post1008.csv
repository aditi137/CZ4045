I'm
using
Python
2.6
and
PyGTK
2.22.6
from
the
all-in-one
installer
on
Windows
XP
","
trying
to
build
a
single-file
executable
(
via
py2exe
)
for
my
app
.
My
problem
is
that
when
I
run
my
app
as
a
script
(
ie
.
not
built
into
an
.
exe
file
","
just
as
a
loose
collection
of
.
py
files
)
","
it
uses
the
native-looking
Windows
theme
","
but
when
I
run
the
built
exe
I
see
the
default
GTK
theme
.
I
know
that
this
problem
can
be
fixed
by
copying
a
bunch
of
files
into
the
dist
directory
created
by
py2exe
","
but
everything
I've
read
involves
manually
copying
the
data
","
whereas
I
want
this
to
be
an
automatic
part
of
the
build
process
.
Furthermore
","
everything
on
the
topic
(
including
the
FAQ
)
is
out
of
date
-
PyGTK
now
keeps
its
files
in
C:\Python2x\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime
\
...
","
and
just
copying
the
lib
and
etc
directories
doesn't
fix
the
problem
.
My
questions
are
:
I'd
like
to
be
able
to
programmatically
find
the
GTK
runtime
data
in
setup.py
rather
than
hard
coding
paths
.
How
do
I
do
this
?
What
are
the
minimal
resources
I
need
to
include
?
Update
:
I
may
have
almost
answered
#
2
by
trial-and-error
.
For
the
""""
wimp
""""
(
ie
.
MS
Windows
)
theme
to
work
","
I
need
the
files
from
:
...
without
the
runtime
prefix
","
but
otherwise
with
the
same
directory
structure
","
sitting
directly
in
the
dist
directory
produced
by
py2exe
.
But
where
does
the
2.10.0
come
from
","
given
that
gtk.gtk_version
is
(
2
","
22
","
0
)
?
