I
have
a
text
file
","
xyz.txt
that
has
variables
","
and
I
want
to
use
those
variables
","
I
know
how
to
read
them
but
do
not
know
how
to
use
it
and
call
them
when
I
need
it
.
For
example
","
If
in
the
text
file
there
is
x
=
123
I
would
like
to
be
able
to
call
on
that
variable
for
use
","
so
if
i
said
print
x
it
would
give
me
123
.
text
file
:
Later
on
It
will
have
more
data
.
