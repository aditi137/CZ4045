I
am
trying
to
list
all
the
functions
in
every
encountered
module
to
enforce
the
writing
of
test
cases
.
However
","
I
am
having
issues
doing
this
with
just
the
fullpath
to
the
file
as
a

and
not
importing
it
.

I
use
"inspect.getmembers(fullpath, inspect.isfunction)"
it
returns
an
empty
array
.
Is
there
any
way
to
accomplish
this
?
Here
is
my
code
so
far
:
