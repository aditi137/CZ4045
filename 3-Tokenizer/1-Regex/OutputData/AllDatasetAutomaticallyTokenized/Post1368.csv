I
am
unsure
what
I
am
doing
wrong
;
or
why
this
is
the
case
.
I've
the
following
code
:
For
a
number
object
say
n
=
Number(KST.Constant(..)
)
","
I
am
always
returned
None
for
the
following
statement
—
Now
if
I
change
the
double
underscores
to
single
ones
","
it
all
works
.
I
understand
the
difference
between
private
and
semi-private
variables
but
why
this
is
happening
—
I've
no
idea
.
Also
","
I've
used
""""
__
""""
in
a
number
of
other
places
and
it
all
seems
to
work
fine
.
