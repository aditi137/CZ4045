I
am
stuck
at
a
part
of
my
script
that
is
supposed
to
perform
the
following
:
a
.
Iterate
through
a
source
directory

each
file
(
name
=
GUID.file
extension
)
to
a
destination
folder
that
is
named
as
that
file's
guid
.
In
theory
","
this
problem
is
simple
enough
to
solve
in
Python
with
the
os.walk()
and
os.rename()
.
The
complication
is
that
the
file
extension
for
some
of
these
files
are
unconventional
as
shown
by
this
screenshot

As
a
workaround
","
I
using
Commons.IO
Java
libraries
.
Yet
my
script
is
erroring
on
the
last
3
lines
when
I
am
trying
to
instantiate
File
objects
.
What
am
I
doing
wrong
?
Script

Error
