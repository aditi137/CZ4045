Worker
will
reserve
tasks
for
each
worker's
tread
.
If
you
want
to
limit
the
number
of
tasks
worker
can
execute
the
same
time
","
you
should
configure
your
concurrency
(
e.g
.
to
limit
1
task
at
the
time
","
you
need
worker
with
1
process
-
c
1
)
.
You
can
also
check
prefetch
configuration
","
but
it
only
defines
the
number
of
tasks
reserved
for
each
process
of
the
worker
.
Here
is
Celery
documentation
where
prefetch
configuration
explained
:
