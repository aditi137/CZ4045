Well
well
","
seems
like
everybody
is
strongly
biased
towards
spaces
.
I
use
tabs
exclusively
.
I
know
very
well
why
.
Tabs
are
actually
a
cool
invention
","
that
came
after
spaces
.
It
allows
you
to
indent
without
pushing
space
millions
of
times
or
using
a
fake
tab
(
that
produces
spaces
)
.
I
really
don't
get
why
everybody
is
discriminating
the
use
of
tabs
.
It
is
very
much
like
old
people
discriminating
younger
people
for
choosing
a
newer
more
efficient
technology
and
complaining
that
pulse
dialing
works
on
every
phone
","
not
just
on
these
fancy
new
ones
.
""""
Tone
dialing
doesn't
work
on
every
phone
","
that's
why
it
is
wrong
""""
.
Your
editor
cannot
handle
tabs
properly
?
Well
","
get
a
modern
editor
.
Might
be
darn
time
","
we
are
now
in
the
21st
century
and
the
time
when
an
editor
was
a
high
tech
complicated
piece
of
software
is
long
past
.
We
have
now
tons
and
tons
of
editors
to
choose
from
","
all
of
them
that
support
tabs
just
fine
.
Also
","
you
can
define
how
much
a
tab
should
be
","
a
thing
that
you
cannot
do
with
spaces
.
Cannot
see
tabs
?
What
is
that
for
an
argument
?
Well
","
you
cannot
see
spaces
neither
!
May
I
be
so
bold
to
suggest
to
get
a
better
editor
?
One
of
these
high
tech
ones
","
that
were
released
some
10
years
ago
already
","
that
display
invisible
characters
?
(
sarcasm
off
)
Using
spaces
causes
a
lot
more
deleting
and
formatting
work
.
That
is
why
(
and
all
other
people
that
know
this
and
agree
with
me
)
use
tabs
for
Python
.
Mixing
tabs
and
spaces
is
a
no-no
and
no
argument
about
that
.
That
is
a
mess
and
can
never
work
.
