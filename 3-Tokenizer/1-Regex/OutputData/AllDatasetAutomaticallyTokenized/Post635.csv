For
the
2D
images
you
might
want
to
consider
the
use
of
NCL
","
produced
by
NCAR
(
The
National
Center
for
Atmospheric
Research
)
","
which
is
specifically
designed
for
manipulating
and
plotting
atmospheric
(
meteorological
)
data
.
An
impressive
gallery
of
results
is
available
on
that
site
.
IMO
NCL's
syntax
can
be
very
ugly
at
times
","
and
it
looks
as
if
a
python
wrapper
","
PyNGL
now
exists
(
gallery
)
For
visualization
of
3D
atmospheric
data
","
some
of
my
colleagues
have
used
a
number
of
very
impressive
tools
including
vis5d
and
vapour
.
For
the
ultimate
in
flexibility
","
mayavi2
","
which
is
basically
a
MATLAB
style
ipython
interface
to
Kitware's
VTK
library
is
used
in
a
huge
range
of
scientific
visualizations
.
I
don't
recommend
this
approach
unless
you're
happy
to
'
roll
your
own
'
","
but
it
is
a
very
nice
if
you
need
to
get
a
three
dimensional
results
looking
just
right
.
