My
solution
was
to
set
up
the
module
like
this
:
The
setup.py
would
contain
something
similar
to
this
:
and
the
file
a.py
would
contain
the
following
lines
in
the
header
:
The
way
it
works
is
very
simple
:
if
you
don't
do
anything
(
i.e.
if
you
don't
compile
the
cython
files
)
then
module
a.py
imports
module
b.py
;
however
","
if
you
run
python
setup.py
build_ext
-
-
inplace
then
the
compiled
cython
files
will
appear
inside
cython_my_module
and
the
next
time
you
run
a.py
it
will
automatically
import the
cython
module
b.pyx
(
actually
it
will
import the
compiled
library
b.so
)
.
So
far
it
seems
to
work
and
requires
almost
no
effort
.
Hope
it
helps
.
fish2000
solution
seems
more
generic
but
I
haven't
tried
it
yet
.
