I
see
you've
solved
the
indentation
issue
","
here's
another
version
of
your
example
:
You
need
to
adjust
the
paths
of
the
images
(
""""
background.jpg
""""
","
""""
player.jpg
""""
)
","
with
this
version
you're
not
loading
over
and
over
your
sprite
in
the
game
event
loop
and
the
Player
movement
will
be
smooth
.
