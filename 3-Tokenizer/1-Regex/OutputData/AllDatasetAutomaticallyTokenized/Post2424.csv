I
am
new
to
PyMC3
and
am
trying
to
implement
the
hierarchical
model
from
Kruschke
(
2015
)
section
12.2.2
(
model
comparison
)
.
I
succeeded
in
defining
the
full
model
and
then
looking
at
the
differences
of
posterior
parameter
values
(
determine
whether
difference
can
credibly
be
said
to
be
zero
)
.
I
also
tried
to
explicitly
do
the
comparison
in
the
model
as
shown
in
the
book
(
defining
a
full
model
and
a
restricted
model
and
sampling
these
using
a
categorical
distribution
)
.
Basically
I
try
to
implement
the
below
JAGS
model
definition
in
PyMC3
.

But
I
don't
know
how
I
can
use
the
model
index
to
select
the
(
pseudo
)
priors
.
Any
pointers
?
JAGS
:
PyMC3
:
Output
:
UPDATED
After
correcting
the
pseudopriors
(
missing
parenthesis
)
the
results
look
much
better
.
However
","
I
am
not
sure
whether
the
pmc.Beta()
function
works
well
with
arrays
as
arguments
for
a
and
b
.
