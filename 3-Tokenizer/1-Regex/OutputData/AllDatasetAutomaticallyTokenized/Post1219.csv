I
have
two
lists
of
sports
players
.
One
is
structured
simply
:
The
second
is
a
list
of
lists
structured
:
I
ultimately
want
to
search
the
contents
of
the
second
list
and
pull
the
info
if
there
is
a
matching
name
from
the
first
list
.
I
need
to
swap
'
Lastname
","
Firstname
'
to
'
Firstname
Lastname
'
to
match
list
2's
formatting
for
simplification
.
Any
help
would
be
great
.
Thanks
!
