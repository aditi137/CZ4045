Both
programs
are
reading
the
same
XML
file
.
First
program
copies
all
data
between
<
text
>
<
/
text
>
tags
.
And
second
program
copies
limited
data
from
<
text
>
<
/
text
>
tags
.
I
want
to
only
limited
data
.
So
is
it
possible
to
use
this
statement
in
first
program
:
First
Program
Second
Program
UPDATE
:
please
help
me
.
Is
there
any
other
alternative
?
