Expanding
on
the
solution
by
Pat
Notz
a
bit
","
I
found
it
even
the
more
elegant
to
:
-
name
the
methods
the
same
as
re
provides
(
e.g
.
search()
vs
.
check()
)
and
-
implement
the
necessary
methods
like
group()
on
the
holder
object
itself
:
Example
Instead
of
e.g
.
this
:
One
does
just
this
:
Looks
very
natural
in
the
end
","
does
not
need
too
many
code
changes
when
moving
from
Perl
and
avoids
the
problems
with
global
state
like
some
other
solutions
.
