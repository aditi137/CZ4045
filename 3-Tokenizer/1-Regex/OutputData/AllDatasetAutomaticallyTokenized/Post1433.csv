I
use
the
code
to
strip
a
line
of
text
from
punctuation
:
The
problem
is
that
words
like
doesn't
turn
to
doesnt

I
want
to
remove
the
punctuation
only
between
words
but
can't
seem
to
figure
out
a
way
to
do
so
.
How
should
I
go
about
this
?
Edit
:
I
thought
about
using
the
strip()
function
but
that
will
only
take
effect
on
the
right
and
left
trailing
of
the
whole
sentence
.
For
example
:
Should
become
:
Instead
of
the
current
output
:
