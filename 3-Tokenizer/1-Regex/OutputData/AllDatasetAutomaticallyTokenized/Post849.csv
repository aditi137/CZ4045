I'm
using
a
Tkinter
Text
box
in
my
Python
(
using
2.7.2
)
script
as
an
entry-type
box
-
-
when
enter
is
pressed
","
it
copies
the
contents
into
a
different
text
box
and
then
deletes
it
out
of
the
entry
one
.
I've
bound
the
necessary
event
to
the
Text
box
when
the
Enter
key
is
pressed
.
The
only
problem
I
have
is
that
whenever
I
hit
the
Enter
key
","
it
seems
to
execute
my
event
and
then
the
widgets
""""
default
""""
binding
:
adding
a
newline
.
I'm
not
sure
of
a
way
to
either
delete
the
newline
after
it
is
added
","
or
simply
get
rid
of
the
widgets
default
binding
.
Thanks
a
lot
!
