I'm
trying
to
solve
an
overdetermined
system
in
Python
","
using
the
numpy.solve
function
.
I
know
the
value
of
one
of
the
variables
and
I
know
that
in
theory
I
can
find
a
unique
solution
for
the
system
if
I
can
somehow
plug
in
that
known
value
.
My
system
is
of
the
form
AxC=B
.
The
variables
are
split
into
two
groups
","
one
group
of
N
variables
and
one
of
T
variables
(
although
this
does
not
matter
for
the
math
)
.
A
is
a
(
T*N
x
T+N
)
matrix
","
C
is
the
variables
vector
","
of
length
(
T+N
)
","
and
B
is
a
vector
of
length
(
T*N
)
.
How
do
I
tell
numpy.solve
(
or
another
function
in
Python
","
but
please
don't
recommend
least
squares
","
I
need
the
unique
","
exact
solution
","
which
I
know
exists
)
to
use
the
known
value
of
one
of
the
variables
?
A
simple
example
of
my
system
would
be
:
The
values
of
the
elements
of
B
would
of
course
be
known
","
as
well
as
the
value
of
one
of
the
variables
","
let's
say
I
know
that
t1=1
.
The
dots
don't
mean
anything
I
just
put
them
there
so
the
characters
wouldn't
bunch
up
.
