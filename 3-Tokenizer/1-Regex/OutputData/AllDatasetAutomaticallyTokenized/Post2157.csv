I'm
doing
some
experimenting
with
Python
args
and
kwargs
and
ran
into
an
unexpected
issue
.
My
code
is
:
The
output
is
:
If
the
args
and
kwargs
loops
are
separate
","
I
would
expect
to
see
:
Why
is
python
behaving
this
way
?
It
looks
like
it's
running
one
iteration
at
a
time
from
each
loop
","
instead
of
all
iterations
from
each
loop
before
moving
to
the
next
.
