I
need
to
get
the
digest
of
a
PKCS#7
envelop
to
manually
check
it
.
Usually
when
you
want
to
validate
the
signature
of
a
pkcs#7
envelop
you
do
that
:
But
in
my
case
","
the
digest
type
is
md5sha1
that
is
not
recognized
by
openssl
:
What
I
need
to
do
I
to
get
the
pkcs#7
signedContent
and
to
manually
check
it
.
What
I
need
is
a
Python
equivalent
to
org.bouncycastle.cms.CMSSignedDataParser
.
How
can
I
get
the
digest
to
be
able
to
validate
it
manually
without
having
to
use
sm_obj.verify
?
