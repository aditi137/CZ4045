I
just
installed
scrapyd
on
Ubuntu
14.04
and
after
the
installation
","
I
simply
typed
""""
scrapyd
""""
into
the
command
line
and
got
:
Failed
to
load
application
:
No
module
named
txweb
I
used
both
the
general
and
Ubuntu
specific
installations
and
neither
seem
to
work
.
Just
for
some
background
","
I
decided
to
use
scrapyd
after
having
created
a
project
that
ran
multiple
spiders
but
was
not
able
to
pipeline
the
scraped
data
into
two
different
tables
.
I
looked
at
some
other
SO
posts
like
this
one
","
but
they
seem
to
be
addressing
older
versions
of
scrapyd
which
probably
won't
be
relevant
anymore
.
Can
someone
show
me
how
to
get
started
with
scrapyd
","
because
the
information
provided
in
the
docs
doesn't
seem
to
be
working
for
me
","
thanks
.
