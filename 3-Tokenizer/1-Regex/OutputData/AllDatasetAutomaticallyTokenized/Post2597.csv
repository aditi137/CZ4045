Let's
try
to
give
this
a
shot
","
starting
with
just
1
location
:
>
>
>
(
long
","
lat
)
=
obSet
[
'
results
'
]
[0]
[
'
location
'
]
Alright
","
so
that
didn't
work
","
but
why
?
It's
because
the
longitude
and
latitude
coordinates
are
just
1
string
","
so
you
can't
unpack
it
immediately
as
a
tuple
.
We
must
first
separate
it
into
two
different
strings
.
>
>
>
(
long
","
lat
)
=
obSet
[
'
results
'
]
[0]
[
'
location
'
]
.
"split("","")"
From
here
we
will
want
to
iterate
through
the
whole
set
of
results
","
which
we
know
are
indexed
from
0
to
n
.
"tuple(obSet['results'][i]['location'].split("","")"
)
will
give
us
the
tuple
of
longitude
","
latitude
for
the
result
at
index
i
","
so
:
>
>
>
[
"tuple(obSet['results'][i]['location'].split("","")"
)
for
i
in
range(n)
]
ought
to
give
us
the
set
of
tuples
we
want
.
