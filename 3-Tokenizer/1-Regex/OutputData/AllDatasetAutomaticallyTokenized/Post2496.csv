IMPORTANT
CHANGE
:
The
following
command
also
works
and
gets
me
the
correct
prompt
.
There
must
then
be
an
issue
with
pymssql
.
So
I'm
fighting
with
my
pymssql
and
freetds
drivers
.
Platform
Versions
Etc
:
Ubuntu
16.04
FreeTDS
v0.91
(
used
by
working
tsql
)
FreeTDS
v0.95
(
used
by
pymssql
)
pymssql
v2.1.3
Target
Database
:
SQL
Azure
(
latest
)
Instructions
for
install
:
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-develop-python-simple/
I've
gone
into
every
freetds.conf
file
I
can
find
:
/
etc
/
freetds
/
freetds.conf
;
/
root
/
.
freetds.conf
I
have
set
the
global
TDS
version
to
8.0
.
I
have
overwritten
from
the
python
perspective
in
my
pymssql.connect
to
overwrite
the
version
to
8.0
I
run
the
diagnostics
tools
:
tsql
-
C
and
get
back
4.2
as
the
version
I
run
the
code
dumping
the
logs
to
stdout
","
and
notice
","
the
version
is
7.1
.
net.c:202:Connecting
to
191.238.6.43
port
1433
(
TDS
version
7.1
)
The
following
tsql
command
works
for
me
...
Notice
the
version
number
.
Its
8.0
.
I
can
validate
I
get
data
back
and
can
do
all
I
want
with
this
.
So
there
is
an
obvious
issue
here
with
how
pymssql
is
hooking
up
with
freetds
.
Here
is
all
the
output
from
the
log
dump
in
case
somebody
sees
something
I
am
failing
to
