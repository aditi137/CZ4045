Here
is
the
situation
:
I
am
using
nginx
","
uwsgi
","
python3.4
","
flask
for
a
web
service
.
In
the
login
process
","
I
want
to
setup
a
global
variable
to
hold
the
{
'
token':'user_id
'
}
dictionary
for
fast
user
token
validation
.
I
have
tried
two
ways
.
The
first
is
using
flask.g
.
But
","
the
problem
is
that
the
flask.g
global
variable
can
not
share
data
between
requests
.
The
second
is
using
app's
config
dictionary
","
but
the
app.config
dictionary
will
changed
when
uwsgi
reloaded
.
Could
someone
tell
me
how
to
achieve
the
goal
?
