I
am
using
Threads
from
the
threading
class
for
the
first
time
and
they
don't
seem
to
be
freeing
themselves
up
after
the
function
runs
.
I
am
attempting
to
have
a
max
of
5
threads
running
at
once
.
Since
one
thread
creates
the
next
there
will
be
some
overlap
but
I'm
seeing
2000
+
threads
running
at
once
before
I
get
the
exception
""""
can't
start
new
thread
""""
.
I'm
open
to
any
other
cleaning
up
I
can
do
here
as
well
since
I'm
pretty
new
to
python
and
entirely
new
to
threading
.
I'm
just
trying
to
get
the
threading
set
up
properly
at
this
point
.
Eventually
this
will
scrape
the
URLS
.
