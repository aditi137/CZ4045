The
reason
that
gameloop
is
not
being
run
is
that
you
have
missed
the
brackets
from
instructionread=instructionread.lower
(
)
This
means
that
instead
instructionread
being
given
the
value
""""
y
""""
it
gets
the
value
of
a
<
built-in
method
lower
of
str
object
>
","
so
the
gameloop
doesn't
run
.
Note
that
gameloop
has
no
loop
(
except
the
one
that
goes
ones
through
the
events
)
.
The
procedure
is
run
once
","
and
then
the
program
quits
.
