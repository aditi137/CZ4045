I
have
a
situation
where
I
have
to
read
and
write
the
list
simultaneously
.
It
seems
the
code
starts
to
read
after
it
completes
writing
all
the
elements
in
the
list.What
I
want
to
do
is
that
the
code
will
keep
on
adding
elements
in
one
end
and
I
need
to
keep
on
processing
first
10
elements
simultaneously
.
