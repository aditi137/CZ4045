You
can
create
a
Python
C
+
+
extension
where
your

built-in
types
.
There
are

.
1.Create
the
extension
yourself
following
the
documentation
provided
in

2.Create
the
extension
using
a
tool
such
as
boost::python
or
SWIG
.
In
my

is
the
best
way
to
go

price
you

on
boost
)
.
For
your
example

the
boost::python
bindings
could
look
as
follows
:
Compile
:
and
run
in
Python
:
