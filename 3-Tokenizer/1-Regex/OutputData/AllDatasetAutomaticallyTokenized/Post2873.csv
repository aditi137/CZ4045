Is
it
possible
for
Requests
to
navigate
its
way
through
the
Forbes
welcome
page
?
I'm
trying
to
access
this
article
which
for
most
will
end
up
with
a
splash
screen
welcome
page
before
then
redirecting
to
the
actual
article
itself
.
I
note
in
Chrome
the
URL
of
the
article
is
then
appended
with
a
value
once
it
resolves
to
the
actual
article
","
though
this
seems
random
every
time
.
I
have
a
sense
this
may
involve
cookies
but
so
far
my
code
has
not
grabbed
any
html
apart
from
the
html
making
up
the
welcome
page
.
Output
I
imagine
that
as
a
browser
can
eventually
resolve
to
the
article
","
Requests
should
be
able
to
as
well
","
but
as
I
can't
work
out
what
Forbes
is
doing
","
I
can't
work
out
how
to
design
the
Requests
argument
appropriately
.
Any
ideas
?
