Base
to
the
directory
permission
is
this
question
on
SO
.
The
directory
only
changes
its
timestamp
when
the
directory
itself
changes
for
ex
:
when
you
create
a
new
file
in
it
.
So
to
update
the
timestamp
of
folder
you
can
create
a
temp
file
and
then
delete
it
.
There
should
be
a
better
way
but
till
you
find
it
you
can
manage
using
this
.
