I
have
this
code
which
scrapes
usernames
:
When
it
starts
putting
all
the
names
in
a
list
like
this
After
an
hour
off
running
I
get
memory
allocation
errors
","
obviously
I
know
why
this
happens
but
how
can
I
fix
it
?
I
was
thinking
just
getting
the
usernames
from
a
single
page
and
output
them
to
file
immediately
","
delete
contents
of
list
","
repeat
","
but
I
didn't
know
how
to
implement
this
.
