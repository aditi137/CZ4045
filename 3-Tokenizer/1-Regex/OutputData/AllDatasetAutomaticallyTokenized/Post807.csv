I
was
wondering
how
I
can
make
a
custom
QDialog
message
box
with
my
own
buttons
","
similar
to
the
code
below
.
So
far
I
have
this
code
","
which
works
pretty
well
.
The
problem
with
this
code
is
that
it
launches
from
a
full
screen
application
","
and
it
steals
the
focus
of
it
(
the
main
taskbar
on
the
top
appears
along
with
the
QDialog
object
)
.
I
want
this
to
work
seamlessly
with
my
fullscreen
application
in
the
background
","
meaning
no
taskbar
at
the
top
should
appear
when
I
click
on
a
button
to
show
this
message
box
.
I'm
working
in
Ubuntu
11.10
with
PyQt4
and
Python
2.7.2
.
