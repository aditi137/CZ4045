I
would
like
to
do
image
conversion
/
rewriting
with
PIL
just
using
RAM
memory
.
I
have
the
image
in
bytes
in
RAM
and
I
would
like
to
convert
it
to
some
other
format
or
possibly
the
same
.
I
know
I
can
do
it
like
saving
it
in
on
the
file
system
with
some
name
","
but
I
would
like
to
do
it
just
using
RAM
without
touching
the
file
system
.
I
haven't
found
any
examples
.
Any
help
would
be
appreciated
!
Thanks
!
