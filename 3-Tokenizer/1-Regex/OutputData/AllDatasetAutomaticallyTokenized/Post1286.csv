You
use
tuple
unpacking
:
Python
can
unpack
nested
sequences
into
separate
variables
","
as
long
as
you
create
the
same
nesting
structure
on
the
left-hand-side
.
The
looping
will
not
work
because
you
are
trying
to
unpack
2-value
tuples
per
loop
iteration
","
where
the
iteration
would
only
yield
only
1
value
.
This
works
across
python
versions
.
