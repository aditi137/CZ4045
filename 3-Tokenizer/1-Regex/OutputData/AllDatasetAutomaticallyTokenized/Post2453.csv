I
wanted
to
run
a
python
script
with
sbatch
","
however
","
it
seems
that
the
only
way
to
run
a
python
script
with
sbatch
is
to
have
a
bash
script
that
then
run
the
python
script
.
As
in
having
batch_main.sh
:
then
running
:
The
issue
with
this
is
that
I'd
wish
to
have
a
separate
config
file
for
the
arguments
(
since
its
usually
not
a
single
number
or
argument
)
and
also
be
able
to
use
the
array
option
.
Also
","
I
usually
run
multiple
different
sbatch
jobs
simultaneously
(
with
different
configurations
)
","
thus
it
would
be
nice
if
changing
the
configuration
file
does
not
make
the
different
sbatch
runs
get
in
the
way
with
one
another
(
since
if
the
job
gets
queued
and
then
the
config
file
changes
later
","
it
will
run
the
most
recent
config
file
rather
than
the
copy
of
the
config
when
I
ran
sbatch
)
.
To
get
around
this
issue
I
discovered
that
when
I
run
a
sbatch
script
","
SLURM
actually
copies
the
submission
script
to
its
internal
database
(
I
disovered
it
after
asking
:
Changing
the
bash
script
sent
to
sbatch
in
slurm
during
run
a
bad
idea
?
)
.
Therefore
","
I
actually
decided
to
hard
code
the
configuration
into
the
bash
submission
script
(
making
the
submission
script
the
config
file
essentially
)
.
That
way
I
just
edit
the
submission
script
and
then
run
the
file
.
However
","
I'd
like
to
stop
this
since
this
makes
me
write
in
bash
which
I
want
to
avoid
at
all
cost
.
Ideally
","
I'd
like
to
run
a
sbatch
that
directly
runs
python
.
Since
this
might
not
be
possible
","
I
wanted
to
know
what
other
options
did
exist
to
solve
this
issue
.
For
example
","
is
it
possible
to
have
slurm
copy
a
different
file
(
like
a
python
config
file
)
to
its
internal
database
so
that
when
it
queues
the
job
it
runs
the
job
that
I
exactly
want
to
run
?
(
notice
that
running
a
sbatch
job
and
then
changing
the
config
file
is
not
the
way
to
do
this
","
since
this
might
cause
issue
when
one
changes
the
config
file
","
slrum
will
read
the
most
recent
copy
of
the
config
rather
than
the
copy
of
the
config
when
the
job
was
ran
)
.
Or
what
other
options
do
I
have
?
Am
I
really
stuck
with
writing
bash
or
can
I
do
something
else
to
deal
with
configurations
in
python
rather
than
some
other
weird
hack
?
In
general
I
also
wanted
to
know
what
people
did
for
this
in
the
real
world
or
what
a
good
practice
/
standard
was
for
this
.
