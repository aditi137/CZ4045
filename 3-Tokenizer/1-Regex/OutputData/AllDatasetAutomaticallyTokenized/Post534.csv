I
am
trying
to
mock-up
an
API
and
am
using
separate
apps
within
Django
to
represent
different
web
services
.
I
would
like
App
A
to
take
in
a
link
that
corresponds
to
App
B
and
parse
the
json
response
.
Is
there
a
way
to
dynamically
construct
the
url
to
App
B
so
that
I
can
test
the
code
in
development
and
not
change
to
much
before
going
into
production
?
The
problem
is
that
I
can't
use
localhost
as
part
of
a
link
.
I
am
currently
using
urllib
","
but
eventually
I
would
like
to
do
something
less
hacky
and
better
fitting
with
the
web
services
REST
paradigm
.
