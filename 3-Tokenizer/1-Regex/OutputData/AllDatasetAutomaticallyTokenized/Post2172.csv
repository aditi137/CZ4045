Here's
a
version
that
puts
everything
into
a
class
so
we
don't
need
to
use
global
variables
.
It
also
avoids
the
import
*
construction
which
is
generally
considered
bad
style
in
Python
.
True
","
lots
of
example
code
uses
import
*
but
it's
not
a
good
practice
because
it
clutters
up
the
global
namespace
with
all
the
names
from
the
imported
module
.
So
those
names
can
clash
with
the
names
of
your
own
variables
","
and
they
can
also
clash
with
the
names
of
other
modules
you
import using
import
*
.
The
program
prints
lists
of
the
selected
Groups
for
each
Test
row
when
the
window
closes
.
