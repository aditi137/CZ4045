Your
render
is
not
considered
if
you
do
not
return
a
value
for
renderer
but
return
a
response
or
exception
-
so
do
not
expect
json
on
the
output
unless
your
error
handler
supports
that
.
You
can
do
something
like
this
instead
:
And
then
you
can
retrieve
the
JSON
in
your
error
handler
and
use
angular.fromJson()
to
read
it
.
