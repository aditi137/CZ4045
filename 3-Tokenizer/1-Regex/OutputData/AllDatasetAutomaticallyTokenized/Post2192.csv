I'm
creating
a
program
to
determine
a
minimum
","
maximum
","
and
percentiles
of
winds
at
certain
heights
.
The
file
is
split
into
5
columns
.
My
code
thus
far
looks
like
this
:
plt.show()
As
you
can
see
it's
plotting
each
min
and
max
at
the
specific
altitude
with
just
a
dot
.
How
can
I
adjust
that
so
it
makes
it
a
line
instead
.
