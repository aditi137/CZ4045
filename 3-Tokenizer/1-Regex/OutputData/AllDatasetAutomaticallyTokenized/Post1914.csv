The
repeat()
iterator
makes
the
load
rows
look
endless
;
you
can
iterate
over
it
forever
.
Presumably
the
actual
code
looks
like
this
:
e.g
.
the
repeat(load)
is
chained
","
so
all
the
data
in
the
CSV
file
looks
like
one
long
sequence
of
rows
","
and
when
you
reach
the
end
of
the
CSV
file
you
simply
start
at
the
beginning
again
","
as
if
the
rows
in
the
CSV
file
are
read
from
an
endless
loop
.
The
islice()
then
picks
a
subset
of
that
endless
loop
.
By
making
the
load
rows
endless
","
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
slice
tries
to
take
more
rows
from
the
file
then
are
present
.
