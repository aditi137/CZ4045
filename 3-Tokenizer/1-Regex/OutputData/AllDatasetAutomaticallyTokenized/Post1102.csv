I
have
2
tables
TBL1
and
TBL2
.
TBL1
has
2
columns
id
","
nSql
.
TBL2
has
3
columns
date
","
custId
","
userId
.
I
have
17
rows
in
TBL1
with
id
1
to
17
.
Each
nSql
has
a
SQL
query
in
it
.
For
example
nSql
for
id
=
=
1
is
:
""""
select
date
","
pId
as
custId
","
tId
as
userId
from
TBL3
""""
id
=
=
2
is
:
""""
select
date
","
qId
as
custId
","
rId
as
userId
from
TBL4
""""
...
nSql
result
is
always
same
3
columns
.
Below
query
runs
and
puts
data
into
the
table
TBL2
.
If
there
is
already
data
in
TBL2
for
that
day
","
I
want
the
query
to
replace
the
data
with
new
data
.
If
there
is
not
data
in
TBL2
","
I
want
to
put
data
in
normal
way
.
For
example
","
if
I
run
the
query
in
the
morning
and
if
I
want
to
run
it
again
in
evening
","
I
want
new
data
to
replace
old
data
for
that
day
","
since
data
will
be
inserted
into
TBL2
everyday
.
It
is
also
precaution
that
if
the
data
already
exists
(
if
run
by
coworker
)
","
I
do
not
want
duplicate
data
for
that
day
.
How
can
I
do
it
?
Thank
you
.
(
I
am
new
to
python
","
I
would
appreciate
if
someone
could
explain
in
steps
and
show
in
the
code
)
