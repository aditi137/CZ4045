I
have
some
classes
in
Python
:
and
a
list
myList
whose
elements
are
all
either
instances
of
Class1
or
Class2
.
I'd
like
to
create
a
new
list
whose
elements
are
the
return
values
of
method
called
on
each
element
of
myList
.
I
have
tried
using
a
""""
virtual
""""
base
class
But
if
I
try
"map(Class0.method, myList)"
I
just
get
[
0
","
0
","
0
","
...
]
.
I'm
a
bit
new
to
Python
","
and
I
hear
that
""""
duck
typing
""""
is
preferred
to
actual
inheritance
","
so
maybe
this
is
the
wrong
approach
.
Of
course
","
I
can
do
but
I
like
the
brevity
of
map
.
Is
there
a
way
to
still
use
map
for
this
?
