I
am
importing
the
datetime
library
in
my
python
program
and
am
taking
the
duration
of
multiple
events
.
Below
is
my
code
for
that
:
Now
I
have
a
value
in
the
variable
""""
duration
""""
.
The
output
of
this
will
be
:
I
want
to
take
the
standard
deviation
of
all
the
durations
and
determine
if
there
is
an
anomaly
.
For
example
","
the
00:45:22
is
an
anomaly
and
I
want
to
detect
that
.
I
could
do
this
if
I
knew
what
format
datetime
was
in
","
but
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
digits
or
anything..I
was
thinking
about
splitting
the
values
up
from
:
and
using
all
the
values
in
between
","
but
there
might
be
a
better
way
.
Ideas
?
