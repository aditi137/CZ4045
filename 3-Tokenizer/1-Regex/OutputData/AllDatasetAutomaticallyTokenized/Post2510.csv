I
agree
with
@Neil
It
looks
like
you
want
a
2d
array
.
Here's
another
way
to
do
it
.
This
will
create
a
0
-
9
number
object
5
to
9
times
.
e.g
[
[
2
","
3
","
4
","
5
...
]
","
[
1
","
2
","
2
","
3
...
]
...
]
Then
you
just
iterate
over
the
object
to
print
it
out
the
way
you
want
UPDATE
Given
the
comment
you
replied
with
here
is
example
of
a
random
number
file
generator
.
If
you
want
more
numbers
on
each
line
format
the
text
inside
the
write
method
.
