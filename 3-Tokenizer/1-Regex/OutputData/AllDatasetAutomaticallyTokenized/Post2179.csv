Based
on
the
question
","
comments
","
and
sample
data
exactly
as
it
is
posted
(
all
spaces
","
no
tabs
)
","
my
assumption
is
that
the
real
question
is
how
to
handle
the
fact
that
each
line
in
the
data
contains
a
different
number
of
spaces
between
each
field
.
Assuming
that
spaces
can
appear
within
a
field
","
but
only
one
at
a
time
","
and
that
two
or
more
spaces
delimit
a
field
","
the
following
regex
would
easily
find
the
breaks
between
each
field
(
two
or
more
spaces
)
:
Then
use
a
substitution
to
replace
all
the
deliminators
:
Of
course
","
that
doesn't
handle
the
line
endings
or
the
heading
.
But
for
the
heading
","
you
will
probably
want
to
split
on
lines
anyway
","
so
you
can
handle
the
end
of
the
line
also
:
Now
","
just
add
an
if
statement
or
two
within
the
loop
to
detect
the
heading
and
format
it
appropriately
and
you
have
a
working
solution
.
As
that
wasn't
specifically
asked
about
","
I'll
leave
that
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
.
