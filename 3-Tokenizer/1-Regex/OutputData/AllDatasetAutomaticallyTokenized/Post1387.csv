Question
:
How
to
define
a
compact
construction
for
this
loop
:
Where
:
L
:
is
a
list
of
objects
of
a
given
type
A
f()
:
a
method
of
A
.
For
example
:
I
found
a
way
of
doing
that
with
a
map
call
and
a
lambda
function
:
However
","
this
call
returns
a
list
","
which
I
wish
not
to
construct
.
Is
there
a
more
elegant
way
of
doing
this
?
