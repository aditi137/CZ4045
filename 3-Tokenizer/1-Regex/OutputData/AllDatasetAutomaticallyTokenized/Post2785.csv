There
are
too
many
issues
with
your
code
to
correctly
identify
what
is
the
problem
.
You
have
an
extra
comma
in
your
custom
tag
:
Your
context
variable
is
called
persons
","
yet
you
are
using
object_list
in
your
template
","
this
needs
to
be
corrected
.
Your
template
has
a
for
loop
","
but
its
missing
a
endfor
You
have
{
%
url
'
member:person-list
'
%
}
this
is
a
namespaced
URL
.
Make
you
have
set
it
up
correctly
in
your
urls.py
.
Your
tag
doesn't
take
any
arguments
","
yet
you
are
passing
it
a
context
variable
in
{
%
get_person_list
persons
%
}
.
Once
you
solve
all
these
","
you
have
to
figure
out
where
the
actual
error
is
coming
from
.
Chances
are
","
it
is
in
your
base
template
which
you
are
inheriting
as
its
obvious
you
don't
have
a
registration_register
url
tag
in
the
code
you
have
posted
.
