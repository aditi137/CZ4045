After
reading
this
wonderful
article
about
speeding-up
looping
in
Python
by
using
built-in
iterators
and
implicit
loops
I
have
tried
it
in
my
code
.
It
worked
well
on
many
parts
","
but
one
small
part
still
annoys
me
-
the
values
I
iterate
over
are
sometimes
stored
as
fields
of
a
class
which
are
the
dictionary
values
","
and
I
can't
get
rid
of
looping
over
my
dictionary
to
retrieve
them
.
Here
is
a
simplified
version
of
my
code
:
So
the
dictionary
d
have
tuples
(
x
","
y
)
as
keys
and
Pair
instances
as
values
","
and
my
goal
is
to
sum
the
radii
of
the
given
sub_list
of
pairs
(
sub_list
could
be
the
entire
dictionary
)
.
Is
there
any
""""
broadcasting
""""
technique
for
that
","
or
the
loop
in
the
marked
line
is
inevitable
?
BTW
-
I
am
a
beginner
","
so
any
useful
comment
about
the
code
(
including
styling
and
Pythonish
will
be
appreciated
.
Thanks
!
