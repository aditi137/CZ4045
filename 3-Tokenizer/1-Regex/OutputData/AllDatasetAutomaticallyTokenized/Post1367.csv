As
the
others
have
pointed
out
","
""""
namemangling

occurs
.
But
what
the
hell
is
that
?
Let's
see
with
an
example
.
Create
an
instance
of
A
:
Access
the
first
variable
of
A
:
Access
the
second
variable
of
A
:
Notice
the
error
A
instance
has
no
attribute
'
__var2
'
.
However
you
can
can
access
it
fine
with
:
So
simply
put
","
whenever
you
have
two
doublescores
(
or
more
)
infront
of
a
method
or
a
variable
","
Python
changes
the
name
of
that
method
or
variable
by
appending
an
underscore
and
the
classname
to
it
.
This
a
sort
of
trick
so
programmers
don't
screw
up
things
by
mistakenly
changing
values
.
