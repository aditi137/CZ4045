You
are
using
a
ProcessPoolExecutor
.
This
will
fork
new
processes
for
performing
work
.
These
processes
will
not
share
memory
","
each
instead
getting
a
copy
of
the
distances
matrix
.
Thus
any
changes
to
their
copy
will
certainly
not
be
reflected
in
the
original
process
.
Try
using
a
ThreadPoolExecutor
instead
.
NOTE
:
Globals
are
generally
viewed
with
distaste
...
pass
the
array
into
the
function
instead
.
