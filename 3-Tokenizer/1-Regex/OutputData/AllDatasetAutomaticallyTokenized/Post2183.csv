New
to
the
python
library
PULP
and
I'm
finding
the
documentation
somewhat
unhelpful
","
as
it
does
not
include
examples
using
lists
of
variables
.
I've
tried
to
create
an
absolutely
minimalist
example
below
to
illustrate
my
confusion
.
The
output
is
:
The
optimizer
is
not
recognizing
the
constraint
that
we
only
add
two
values
.
