\
S
+
matches
any
sequence
of
characters
","
including
'
/
'
.
So
your
second
regex
is
matching
the
entire
string
of
""""
299d8fe1-7d9f-434a-ba64-94fb7a16b1a6
/
song_info
/
""""
as
the
UUID
parameter
","
and
sending
it
to
views.song
","
which
unsurprisingly
does
not
find
a
matching
song
.
You
should
make
your
regexes
more
discriminating
:
Also
","
you
should
usually
put
your
regexes
in
order
of
more
specific
to
more
general
;
Django
matches
in
order
","
so
if
you
had
put
song_info
first
that
would
also
have
solved
your
problem
.
