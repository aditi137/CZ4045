I
wrote
a
small
program
to
do
the
following
.
I'm
wondering
if
there
is
an
obviously
more
optimal
solution
:
1
)
Take
2
lists
of
strings
.
In
general
","
the
strings
in
the
second
list
will
be
longer
than
in
the
first
list
","
but
this
is
not
guaranteed
2
)
Return
a
list
of
strings
derived
from
the
second
list
that
has
removed
any
matching
strings
from
the
first
list
.
The
list
will
therefore
contain
strings
that
are
<
=
the
length
of
the
strings
in
the
second
list
.
Below
I've
displayed
a
picture
example
of
what
I'm
talking
about
:
so
far
I
this
is
what
I
have
.
It
seems
to
be
working
fine
","
but
I'm
just
curious
if
there
is
a
more
elegant
solution
that
I'm
missing
.
By
the
way
","
I'm
keeping
track
of
the
""""
positions
""""
of
each
start
and
end
of
the
string
","
which
is
important
for
a
later
part
of
this
program
.

Sample
