The
order
is
not
defined
","
and
depends
on
the
filesystem
.
I
remember
reading
","
many
years
ago
","
that
one
of
the
improvements
of
ext3
over
ext2
is
keeping
the
pointer
in
the
directory
listing
and
beginning
the
next
operation
on
that
entry
.
Often
a
program
will
stat()
then
open()
an
entry
","
so
scanning
from
the
beginning
of
the
(
internal
)
list
would
occur
twice
for
ext2
;
with
ext3
the
second
operation
would
already
be
on
the
desired
entry
making
the
search
for
it
very
fast
.
This
is
significant
with
many
files
in
a
directory
.
The
point
being
that
listing
the
directory
will
begin
the
list
of
entries
whereever
that
pointer
happened
to
be
.
Also
","
the
order
in
which
entries
are
created
may
affect
the
order
.
The
ls
program
performs
a
sort
operation
before
producing
output
so
that
it
is
visually
consistent
and
usable
.
