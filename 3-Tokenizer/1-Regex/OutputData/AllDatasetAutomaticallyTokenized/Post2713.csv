I
just
installed
Google
app
engine
for
Python
2.7
and
I
wrote
some
code
for
test
.
Just
a
simple
HTML
form
.
Here
is
the
code
:
And
then
I
tried
to
write
a
separate
procedure
that
writes
out
my
form
","
like
so
:
Well
","
the
thing
is
that
the
first
code
is
working
fine
","
but
the
second
one
is
returning
the
HTTP
error
500
.
I
tried
this
out
from
a
course
on
Udacity
and
I
simply
copied
the
code
from
there
.
I
really
don't
know
why
it's
not
working
.
PS
.
I
see
this
message
in
terminal
(
Linux
)
:
""""

]
default
:
""""

HTTP

""""
500
-
""""
Later
Edit
:
I
solved
this
by
simply
writing
the
""""
write_form
""""
procedure
after
the
""""
get
""""
procedure
inside
the
MainPage
class
.
