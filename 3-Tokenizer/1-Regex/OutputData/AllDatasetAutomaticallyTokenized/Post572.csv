NOTE
:
This
questions
is
similar
to
but
not
the
same
as
this
one
.
]
Visual
Studio
defines
several
dozen
""""
Macros
""""
which
are
sort
of
simulated
environment
variables
(
completely
unrelated
to
C
+
+
macros
)
which
contain
information
about
the
build
in
progress
.
Examples
:
ConfigurationName
Release
TargetPath
D:\work\foo\win\Release\foo.exe
VCInstallDir
C:\ProgramFiles\Microsoft
Visual
Studio
9.0\VC
\
Here
is
the
complete
set
of
43
built-in
Macros
that
I
see
(
yours
may
differ
depending
on
which
version
of
VS
you
use
and
which
tools
you
have
enabled
)
:
ConfigurationName
IntDir
RootNamespace
TargetFileName
DevEnvDir
OutDir
SafeInputName
TargetFramework
FrameworkDir
ParentName
SafeParentName
TargetName
FrameworkSDKDir
PlatformName
SafeRootNamespace
TargetPath
FrameworkVersion
ProjectDir
SolutionDir
VCInstallDir
FxCopDir
ProjectExt
SolutionExt
VSInstallDir
InputDir
ProjectFileName
SolutionFileName
WebDeployPath
InputExt
ProjectName
SolutionName
WebDeployRoot
InputFileName
ProjectPath
SolutionPath
WindowsSdkDir
InputName
References
TargetDir
WindowsSdkDirIA64
InputPath
RemoteMachine
TargetExt
Of
these
","
only
four
(
FrameworkDir
","
FrameworkSDKDir
","
VCInstallDir
and
VSInstallDir
)
are
set
in
the
environment
used
for
build-events
.
As
Brian
mentions
","
user-defined
Macros
can
be
defined
such
as
to
be
set
in
the
environment
in
which
build
tasks
execute
.
My
problem
is
with
the
built-in
Macros
.
I
use
a
Visual
Studio
Post-Build
Event
to
run
a
python
script
as
part
of
my
build
process
.
I'd
like
to
pass
the
entire
set
of
Macros
(
built-in
and
user-defined
)
to
my
script
in
the
environment
but
I
don't
know
how
.
Within
my
script
I
can
access
regular
environment
variables
(
e.g
.
","
Path
","
SystemRoot
)
but
NOT
these
""""
Macros
""""
.
All
I
can
do
now
is
pass
them
on-by-one
as
named
options
which
I
then
process
within
my
script
.
For
example
","
this
is
what
my
Post-Build
Event
command
line
looks
like
:
postbuild.py
-
-
"t=""$(TargetPath"
)
""""
-
-
"c=""$(ConfigurationName"
)
""""
Besides
being
a
pain
in
the
neck
","
there
is
a
limit
on
the
size
of
Post-Build
Event
command
line
so
I
can't
pass
dozens
Macros
using
this
method
even
if
I
wanted
to
because
the
command
line
is
truncated
.
Does
anyone
know
if
there
is
a
way
to
pass
the
entire
set
of
Macro
names
and
values
to
a
command
that
does
NOT
require
switching
to
MSBuild
(
which
I
believe
is
not
available
for
native
VC
+
+
)
or
some
other
make-like
build
tool
?
