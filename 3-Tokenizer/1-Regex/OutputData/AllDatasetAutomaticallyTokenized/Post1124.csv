I
am
new
to
Python
and
am
trying
to
grasp
existing
scripts
.
This
example
is
given
from
pdfrw
as
follows
:
http://code.google.com/p/pdfrw/wiki/ExampleTools
""""
A
printer
with
a
fancy
printer
and
/
or
a
full-up
copy
of
Acrobat
can
easily
turn
your
small
PDF
into
a
little
booklet
(
for
example
","
print
4
letter-sized
pages
on
a
single
11
""""
x
17
""""
)
.
But
that
assumes
several
things
","
including
that
the
personnel
know
how
to
operate
the
hardware
and
software
.
booklet.py
lets
you
turn
your
PDF
into
a
preformatted
booklet
","
to
give
them
fewer
chances
to
mess
it
up
:
""""
As
best
I
can
tell
the
steps
are
:
the
function
starts
looping
through
the
pages
a
variable
""""
shift_right
""""
is
declared
that
does
?
?
?
(
I
think
it
is
for
the
metadata
?
)
a
variable
""""
stuff
""""
is
declared
that
is
useful
only
for
metadata
(
I
think
)
x
is
incremented
by
the
third
index
of
the
BBox
list
(
what
is
this
list
","
when
was
it
established
?
)
y
is
assigned
to
the
larger
value
between
y
and
the
third
index
of
the
Bbox
list
(
again
","
what
does
this
list
refer
to
?
)
I
think
my
core
confusion
is
regarding
those
two
lines
with
BBox
","
and
how
they
interact
to
create
a
11x17
booklet
PDF
.
Thank
you
for
anyone
who
can
clear
this
up
.
