Without
knowing
much
about
the
variables
in
your
code
","
the
error
indicates
that
at
model.classes_
is
1
or
more
dimensions
","
and
the
first
is
size
2
","
in
other
words
2
rows
/
classes
","
and
possibly
many
columns
.
ypred
is
probably
quite
large
","
and
np.argmax(ypred...)
is
the
index
of
its
largest
values
(
along
axis
0
)
","
i.e.
14328
.
Maye
the
correct
use
is
model.classes_
[
:
","
np.argmax
...
]
.
You
need
to
look
at
the
shape
of
ypred
","
andmodel.classes_
`
","
and
possibly
other
variables
in
this
area
.
