Yesterday
","
I
asked
this
question
and
never
really
got
an
answer
I
was
really
happy
with
.
I
really
would
like
to
know
how
to
generate
a
list
of
N
unique
random
numbers
using
a
functional
language
such
as
Ruby
without
having
to
be
extremely
imperative
in
style
.
Since
I
didn't
see
anything
I
really
liked
","
I've
written
the
solution
I
was
looking
for
in
LINQ
:
Can
you
translate
my
LINQ
to
Ruby
?
Python
?
Any
other
functional
programming
language
?
Note
:
Please
try
not
to
use
too
many
loops
and
conditionals
-
otherwise
the
solution
is
trivial
.
Also
","
I'd
rather
see
a
solution
where
you
don't
have
to
generate
an
array
much
bigger
than
N
so
you
can
then
just
remove
the
duplicates
and
trim
it
down
to
N
.
I
know
I'm
being
picky
","
but
I'd
really
like
to
see
some
elegant
solutions
to
this
problem
.
Thanks
!
Edit
:
Why
all
the
downvotes
?
Originally
my
code
sample
had
the
Distinct()
after
the
Take()
which
","
as
many
pointed
out
","
could
leave
me
with
an
empty
list
.
I've
changed
the
order
in
which
those
methods
are
called
to
reflect
what
I
meant
in
the
first
place
.
Apology
:
I've
been
told
this
post
came
across
as
rather
snobbish
.
I
wasn't
trying
to
imply
that
LINQ
is
better
than
Ruby
/
Python
;
or
that
my
solution
is
much
better
than
everyone
else's
.
My
intent
is
just
to
learn
how
to
do
this
(
with
certain
constraints
)
in
Ruby
.
I'm
sorry
if
I
came
across
as
a
jerk
.
