Recognizing
this
question
was
asked
years
ago
","
I
think
a
more
elegant
solution
is
offered
on
github
by
frmdstryr
using
his
module
pyminutils
:
Excerpt
:
This
utilizes
the
COM
interface
and
automatically
indicates
that
admin
privileges
are
needed
with
the
familiar
dialog
prompt
that
you
would
see
if
you
were
copying
into
a
directory
where
admin
privileges
are
required
and
also
provides
the
typical
file
progress
dialog
during
the
copy
operation
.
