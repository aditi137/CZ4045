In
function
gasdev
you
declare
ran2
as
an
external
function
.
As
you
then
don't
link
in
any
such
function
importing
the
module
will
fail
.
Instead
","
remove
the
declaration
of
ran2
in
gasdev
","
in
which
case
the
ran2
call
uses
the
explicit
interface
to
the
ran2
function
in
the
module
","
and
everything
works
.
