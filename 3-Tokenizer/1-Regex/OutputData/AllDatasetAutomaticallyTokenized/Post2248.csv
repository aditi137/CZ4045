You
are
confused
between
media
and
static
.
Hopefully
this
will
clarify
the
matter
:
Static
Files
Static
files
are
files
that
are
shipped
as
part
of
your
application
.
STATIC_ROOT
is
where
the
collectstatic
command
will
dump
all
static
files
","
so
you
can
move
them
to
the
production
web
server
.
You
don't
need
to
mess
with
STATIC_ROOT
during
development
.
In
your
case
","
you
have
an
application
Vote
","
and
inside
it
you
have
a
static
folder
.
That's
all
you
need
to
serve
static
files
during
development
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
{
%
static
'
folder
/
filename.ext
'
%
}
where
folder
is
the
folder
inside
static
that
contains
your
file
.
So
if
your
directory
structure
is
:
You
need
<
img
src
=
""""
{
%
static
'
vote
/
images
/
foo.jpg
'
%
}
""""
>
Media
Files
Media
files
are
what
django
calls
files
that
are
uploaded
by
your
application's
users
For
uploading
files
","
you
need
to
set
a
location
where
all
uploaded
files
are
stored
.
This
location
is
the
parent
directory
and
its
universal
across
your
entire
project
.
The
setting
for
this
is
MEDIA_ROOT
.
This
should
be
a
full
system
file
path
.
Suppose
you
set
MEDIA_ROOT
=
'
/
home
/
foo
/
bar
/
proj
/
media
'
","
and
in
your
models
you
have
:
Files
for
the
model
will
be
uploaded
to
/
home
/
foo
/
bar
/
proj
/
media
/
logos
/
.
To
display
these
files
","
you
need
to
tell
django
the
name
of
a
link
that
points
to
the
MEDIA_ROOT
directory
","
this
setting
is
MEDIA_URL
.
For
development
","
you
need
to
do
three
things
:
Set
MEDIA_URL
to
/
media
/
Configure
urls.py
to
serve
media
files
:
Add
'
django.template.context_processors.media
'
to
context_processors
in
TEMPLATES
.
This
will
activate
{
{
MEDIA_URL
}
}
in
your
templates
.
