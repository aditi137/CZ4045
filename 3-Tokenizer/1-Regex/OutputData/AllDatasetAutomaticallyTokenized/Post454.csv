With
ctypes
","
you
can
achieve
the
same
thing
with
Documentation
:
addressof(C instance)
->
integer
Return
the
address
of
the
C
instance
internal
buffer
Note
that
in
CPython
","
currently
id(a)
=
=
ctypes.addressof(a)
","
but
ctypes.addressof
should
return
the
real
address
for
each
Python
implementation
","
if
ctypes
is
supported
memory
pointers
are
a
valid
notion
.
Edit
:
added
information
about
interpreter-independence
of
ctypes
