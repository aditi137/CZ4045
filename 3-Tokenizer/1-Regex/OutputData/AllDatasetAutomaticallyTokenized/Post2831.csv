I
convert
a
string
to
date
using
pandas
.
When
I
write
the
DF
to
CSV
","
the
date
comes
like
'
2016-08-15
instead
of
plain
2016-08-15
.
Unable
to
read
it
as
date
in
ETL
tool.Same
is
the
case
for
all
date
fields
.
Any
suggestion
to
get
the
date
format
correctly
?
df.to_csv('/Users/tcssig/Documents/Sarang.csv')
