you
said

long
line
is
divided
in
2
lines
or
more
","
right
?
you
could
count
lines
this

is
the

are
dealing
with
","
and
MaxLen
is
the
maximum
number
of
characters
that
the
textbox
can
show
in
a
line
but
this
just
doesn't
solve
the
problem
if
you
don't
know
how
to
get
MaxLen
","
and
i
actually
don't
...
