New
to
multiprocessing
in
python
","
consider
that
you
have
the
following
function
:
Now
the
point
is
that
I
want
the
doit.main
to
run
in
another
process
and
to
be
non
blocking
","
so
the
code
in
do_something_else
will
run
immediately
after
the
first
has
been
launched
in
another
process
.
How
can
I
do
it
using
python
subprocess
module
?
Is
there
a
difference
between
subprocessing
and
creating
new
process
aside
to
another
one
","
why
would
we
need
a
child
processes
of
other
process
?
Note
:
I
do
not
want
to
use
multithreaded
approach
here
.
.
EDIT
:
I
wondered
whether
using
a
subprocess
module
and
multiprocess
module
in
the
same
function
is
prohibited
?
Reason
I
want
this
is
that
I
have
two
things
to
run
:
first
an
exe
file
","
and
second
a
function
","
each
needs
it
own
process
.
