Apart
from
what
Eli
Courtwright
said
:
I
find
iterators
in
Python
more
concise
.
You
can
use
for
i
in
something
","
and
it
works
with
pretty
much
everything
.
Yeah
","
Java
has
gotten
better
since
1.5
","
but
for
example
you
can
iterate
through
a
string
in
python
with
this
same
construct
.
Introspection
:
In
python
you
can
get
at
runtime
information
about
an
object
or
a
module
about
its
symbols
","
methods
","
or
even
its
docstrings
.
You
can
also
instantiate
them
dynamically
.
Java
has
some
of
this
","
but
usually
in
Java
it
takes
half
a
page
of
code
to
get
an
instance
of
a
class
","
whereas
in
Python
it
is
about
3
lines
.
And
as
far
as
I
know
the
docstrings
thing
is
not
available
in
Java
