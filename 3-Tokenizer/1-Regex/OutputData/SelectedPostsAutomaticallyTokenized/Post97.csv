I'm
trying
to
get
a
webservice
up
and
running
that
actually
requires
to
check
whois
databases
.
What
I'm
doing
right
now
is
ugly
and
I'd
like
to
avoid
it
as
much
as
I
can
:
I
call
gwhois
command
and
parse
its
output
.
Ugly
.
I
did
some
search
to
try
to
find
a
pythonic
way
to
do
this
task
.
Generally
I
got
quite
much
nothing
-
this
old
discussion
list
link
has
a
way
to
check
if
domain
exist
.
Quite
not
what
I
was
looking
for
...
But
still
","
it
was
best
anwser
Google
gave
me
-
everything
else
is
just
a
bunch
of
unanwsered
questions
.
Any
of
you
have
succeeded
to
get
some
method
up
and
running
?
I'd
very
much
appreciate
some
tips
","
or
should
I
just
do
it
the
opensource-way
","
sit
down
and
code
something
by
myself
?
