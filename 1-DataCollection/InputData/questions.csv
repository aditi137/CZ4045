"16423025","1","","<p>I have a list of vertices and the length between them. I want to create a function which finds the distance between 2 vertices in the list by searching through the list.</p>

<p>the list will look something like:</p>

<pre><code>lengths = [[X, Y, length], [X, Z, length], [Y, Z, length], etc]
</code></pre>

<p>Say the vertices are X and Y could I index the list using X,Y to find the length between X and Y?</p>

<p>Currently I am doing it like this:</p>

<pre><code>def find_sides(X, Y, lengths):
    for a in lengths:
        if a[0] == X and a[1] == Y:
            length = a[2]
    return length
</code></pre>

<p>But as the list of lengths grows this could take time. </p>

<p>Thanks</p>

"31602160","1","","<p>So, I have a directory structure:</p>

<pre><code>main.py
\_ modules/
   \_ a.py
   \_ b.py
</code></pre>

<p>In main.py, modules are dynamically loaded at runtime, depending on which modules are specified. (This allows for a hypothetical <code>c.py</code> to be added, <code>main.py</code> to be rerun, and the program to detect the addition of <code>c.py</code> and run it.)</p>

<p>The problem is that <code>b.py</code> imports a module installed via pip (in a virtualenv). (I'm going to refer to it as a library to help avoid confusion.) When <code>b.py</code> is run directly (<code>python b.py</code>) the library imports just fine. When the shell is opened and the library is imported by hand, it works.</p>

<p>But, when <code>main.py</code> is run and <code>b.py</code> is dynamically imported (using <code>pkgutil.iter_modules</code> to detect the modules and then <code>importlib.import_module</code> to import the required ones), the library that <code>b.py</code> imports isn't found - an <code>ImportError: No module</code> is thrown.</p>

<p>To recap: a module imports an installed library, and this works when the module is run directly or when the library in question is imported manually in the python interpreter, but when the module is dynamically imported, the library isn't found. What gives?</p>

"15782500","1","","<p>I have a simple python script however it displays a much higher execution time when it's run for the first time in a while.  If I execute it immediately after it's faster by a few factors.</p>

<p>This script is run on a private test server with no applications running on it so I don't think a lack of system resources is what is causing it to run slower.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

<p>I've ran similar tests for php scripts that include external scripts and there's negligible variance in the execution time of that script.</p>

<p>This variance affects my application because such scripts are called several times and cause the response to be delivered between 70ms and 450ms.</p>

<p>I want to train a specific network architecture (a <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GAN</a>) that needs inputs from different sources during training.</p>

<p>One input source is examples loaded from disk. The other source is a generator sub-network creating examples.</p>

<p>To choose which kind of input to feed to the network I use <code>tf.cond</code>. There is one caveat though that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/34934543/850264"">has already been explained</a>: <code>tf.cond</code> evaluates the inputs to both conditional branches even though only one of those will ultimately be used.</p>

<p>Variant 1 does not work at all since the queue runner threads don't seem to run. <code>print(threads)</code> outputs something like <code>[&lt;Thread(Thread-1, stopped daemon 140165838264064)&gt;, ...]</code>.</p>

<p>Variant 2 does work and <code>print(threads)</code> outputs something like <code>[&lt;Thread(Thread-1, started daemon 140361854863104)&gt;, ...]</code>.

class Photo(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(...)
    answer_id = models.Foreignkey(Answer, related_name='photos')

<p>The relationship is one-to-many (one answer has many photos)</p>

<p>I need to write a reporting function that outputs all answers along with corresponding photos. Here is what I have:</p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>def report():
    answers = Answer.objects.all()

    for answer in answers:
        result = extract_data(answer)
        for photo in answer.photos.all(): # &lt;- executed N times, as N = # of answers in db
            result += photo.name + '\r'

        append_result_to_report(result)
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but as you can see it already, the number of times <code>for photo in answer.photos.all()</code> will be executed equal to the number of answers in the db. </p>

<p>Preferably, I would like to only execute two db querys, one fetches all of the answers and the other fetches all of the photos. So I tried this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-python prettyprint-override""><code>def report():
    answers = Answer.objects.all()
    photos = list(Photo.objects.all()) # &lt;- store the result in memory
    for answer in answers:
        result = extract_data(answer)
        for photo in photos: 
            if photo.answer_id = answer.id:
                result += photo.name + '\r'

        append_result_to_report(result)
</code></pre>

<p>This approach has decreased the number of db queries down to two but it takes even longer to execute as whole. 9.5 seconds for this approach vs 7.5 seconds for the 1st approach.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how to be more effcient?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>P.S. I am using Django 1.8.2</p>

<p>UPDATE: I used the method suggested by @Mark Galloway, and the execution time has dropped to 1.6 seconds. The number of queries becomes 3. Django performed the following query:</p>

<li>select * from photo</li>
<li>select * from photo where 'photo.answer_id' in (19,20,3...) # the numbers inside the () does not seem to be continous</li>

By dictionary which adds all these three data frames into one bigger data frame dfs </p>

<p>dfs = {'df1': df1, 'df2': df2} </p>

<p>Then further,</p>

<pre><code>common_tups = set.intersection(*[set(df[['chr', 'start', 'end']].drop_duplicates().apply(tuple, axis=1).values) for df in dfs.values()])
pd.concat([df[df[['chr', 'start', 'end']].apply(tuple, axis=1).isin(common_tups)].assign(Sample=name) for (name, df) in dfs.items()])
</code></pre>

<p>This gives out the resulting data frame with matching rows from all three data frames, but I have 25 data frames which I am calling as list from the directory as following,</p>

<pre><code>path         = 'Fltered_vcfs/' 
files        = os.listdir(path)
results      = [os.path.join(path,i) for i in files if i.startswith('vcf_filtered')]
</code></pre>

<p>And so how can I show the list 'results' in the dictionary and proceed further to get the desired output. Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

"39186000","1","","<p>I need some major improvements in my programming/coding and it's already been a month of this computer language field.</p>

<p>Right now I'm trying to create a class with 3 functions (lunch, breakfast, and dinner) and let's say I want to call the function lunch and add 'Strawberry' to the lunch list; it's supposed to add 1 to the list count (<code>list_count</code>) for amount of foods entered in the list count so far, and adds 'strawberry' to the dictionary. </p>

<p>So what I'm trying to do is I created a blank dictionary list (<code>lunch_list</code>) and created a starting count of food items (<code>lunch_count</code>)</p>

<p>So if I call lunch in the Food class, I'm trying to make the result like this:</p>

<pre><code>list_count: 1
lunch_name: Strawberry
lunch_list = {1:'Strawberry'}
</code></pre>

<p>I was ready to write this script but after writing this I confused myself a lot more. I feel lost. This is going to be embarassing for me but here is my code:</p>

<pre><code>class Food():

    lunch_count = 0
    lunch_list = {}

    def __init__(self, food_name):
        self.food_name = food_name 

    def lunch(self, lunch_count):
        lunch_count += 1
        lunch_list[lunch_count] = self.food_name
        return lunch_list




strawberry = Food('Strawberry')

print strawberry.lunch('Strawberry')

<p>I also tried to explicitly do the comparison in the model as shown in the book (defining a full model and a restricted model and sampling these using a categorical distribution). </p>

<p>Basically I try to implement the below JAGS model definition in PyMC3.<BR>

<p>I am pulling the data back to a notebook via code like the following:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

%load_ext sql
%sql postgresql://foo:foo@localhost:5432/barbar

result_from_sql = %%sql SELECT Date, Year,Score, Cost FROM MyData;
result_df = result_from_sql.DataFrame()
</code></pre>

<p>In the PostgreSQL table all columns were typed accurately but <code>result_df</code> is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>result_df.dtypes

date          object
year          int64
score         object
cost          object
</code></pre>

<p>Converting the date column was fine:</p>

<pre><code>result_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(result_df['date'])
</code></pre>

<p>As was ensuring all <code>None</code> values are now <code>NaN</code> values:</p>

<pre><code>result_df.replace([None], [np.nan], inplace=True)
</code></pre>

<p>But to convert the columns score &amp; cost to numeric I need to execute the following 3 lines of code:</p>

<pre><code>s = ['score', 'cost']
result_df[s] = pd.to_numeric(result_df[s].astype(str), errors = 'coerce')
result_df[s] = result_df[s].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')
</code></pre>

<p>If I use only lines 1 and 2 then the typing is still object - if I use only lines 1 and 3 then all the data is converted to <code>NaN</code> as if all the data has not coerced.</p>

<p>Why do I have to use this code and is there a more elegant solution?</p>

"39186812","1","","<p>I wanted to run a python script with sbatch, however, it seems that the only way to run a python script with sbatch is to have a bash script that then run the python script. As in having <code>batch_main.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=python_script

arg=argument

python python_batch_script.sh
</code></pre>

<p>then running:</p>

<pre><code>sbatch batch_main.sh
</code></pre>

<p>The issue with this is that I'd wish to have a separate config file for the arguments (since its usually not a single number or argument) and also be able to use the array option. Also, I usually run <strong>multiple different</strong> sbatch jobs <strong>simultaneously</strong> (with <strong>different</strong> configurations), thus it would be nice if changing the configuration file does not make the different sbatch runs get in the way with one another (since if the job gets queued and then the config file changes later, it will run the most recent config file rather than the copy of the config when I ran sbatch). To get around this issue I discovered that when I run a sbatch script, SLURM actually copies the submission script to its internal database (I disovered it after asking: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38778844/changing-the-bash-script-sent-to-sbatch-in-slurm-during-run-a-bad-idea"">Changing the bash script sent to sbatch in slurm during run a bad idea?</a>). Therefore, I actually decided to hard code the configuration into the bash submission script (making the submission script the config file essentially). That way I just edit the submission script and then run the file. However, I'd like to stop this since this makes me write in bash which I want to avoid at all cost. </p>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to run a sbatch that directly runs python. </p>

<p>Since this might not be possible, I wanted to know what other options did exist to solve this issue. For example, is it possible to have slurm copy a different file (like a python config file) to its internal database so that when it queues the job it runs the job that I exactly want to run? (notice that running a sbatch job and then changing the config file is not the way to do this, since this might cause issue when one changes the config file, slrum will read the most recent copy of the config rather than the copy of the config when the job was ran). Or what other options do I have? Am I really stuck with writing bash or can I do something else to deal with configurations in python rather than some other weird hack? </p>

<p>In general I also wanted to know what people did for this in the real world or what a good practice/standard was for this.</p>

<pre><code>intermediate = array[slice[0]:slice[0+1]+1] + array[slice[2]:slice[2+1]+1] + array[slice[4]:slice[4+1]+1]
</code></pre>

<p>which is</p>

<pre><code>intermediate  = array[2:(4+1)] + array[6:(8+1)] + array[10:(12+1)]  
</code></pre>

<p>and when <code>slice[i] is interval[j]</code> <code>output = output + intermediate</code> and the slicing is continued.</p>

<pre><code>output = output + [intermediate]
</code></pre>

<p>which is</p>

<pre><code>output = output + [array[2:(4+1)] + array[6:(8+1)] + array[10:(12+1)]]
</code></pre>

<p>now the next value in interval is 17 so till we have 17 in <code>slice</code> we form another list from <code>array[slice[6]:slice[6+1]+1]</code> and add this to the output. This continues.</p>

<p>The final output should be:</p>

<pre><code>output = [array[slice[0]:slice[0+1]+1] + array[slice[2]:slice[2+1]+1] + array[slice[4]:slice[4+1]+1] , array[slice[6]:slice[6+1]+1], array[slice[8]:slice[8+1]+1]]
</code></pre>

<p>which is</p>

<pre><code>output = [[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], [12, 13, 14], [15, 16, 17]]

I want to be able to change it easily so I can use it on multiple places of my documentation. I guess that an example would be ""We currently use the protocol (proto.txt).""

"39187043","1","","<p>I've been stumped for far too long.  Hoping someone can assist.</p>

<p>I am writing a Python CLI application that needs to set a temporary environment variable (PATH) for the current command prompt session (Windows).  The application already sets the environment variables permanently for all future sessions, using the method seen <a href=""https://gist.github.com/apetrone/5937002"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>To attempt to set the temporary env vars for the current session, I attempted the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>using <code>os.environ</code> to set the environment variables</li>
<li>using the answer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3636055/how-to-modify-the-path-variable-definitely-through-the-command-line-in-windows"">here</a> which makes use of a temporary file.  Unfortunately this works when run directly from the Cmd Prompt, but not from Python.</li>
<li>calling <code>SET</code> using <code>subprocess.call</code>, <code>subprocess.check_call</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The users of the tool will need this so they do not have to close the command prompt in order to leverage the environment variables I've set permanently.</p>

<p>I've see other applications do this, but I'm not sure how to accomplish this with Python.</p>

<p>I was wanting to perform an Xpath query and use a variable in the expression to cycle through all the elements using an index.</p>

<p>For example, rather than having the specific position of <code>[1]</code>, <code>[2]</code>, etc, I'd like to be able to place a variable <code>i</code> in this expression:</p>

<p>I'm unsure whether it's even possible, but I guess it can't hurt to ask!</p>

<p>To clarify, this is why I would like to do this: I'm trying to process all the elements of <code>a_movie[1]</code>, then at the end of the function, I want to process all the elements of <code>a_movie[2]</code>, and so on.</p>

"39187149","1","","<p>I've read a lot about different techniques for iterating over numpy arrays recently and it seems that consensus is not to iterate at all (for instance, see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38207528/what-are-the-efficient-ways-to-loop-over-vectors-along-a-specified-axis-in-numpy"">a comment here</a>). There are several similar questions on SO, but my case is a bit different as I have to combine ""iterating"" (or not iterating) and accessing previous values.</p>

<p>Let's say there are N (N is small, usually 4, might be up to 7) 1-D numpy arrays of <code>float128</code> in a list <code>X</code>, all arrays are of the same size. To give you a little insight, these are data from PDE integration, each array stands for one function, and I would like to apply a Poincare section. Unfortunately, the algorithm should be both memory- and time-efficient since these arrays are sometimes ~1Gb each, and there are only 4Gb of RAM on board (I've just learnt about memmap'ing of numpy arrays and now consider using them instead of regular ones).</p>

<p>One of these arrays is used for ""filtering"" the others, so I start with <code>secaxis = X.pop(idx)</code>. Now I have to locate pairs of indices where <code>(secaxis[i-1] &gt; 0 and secaxis[i] &lt; 0) or (secaxis[i-1] &lt; 0 and secaxis[i] &gt; 0)</code> and then apply simple algebraic transformations to remaining arrays, <code>X</code> (and save results). Worth mentioning, data shouldn't be wasted during this operation.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways for doing that, but none of them seem efficient (and elegant enough) to me. One is a C-like approach, where you just iterate in a for-loop:</p>

<pre><code>import array # better than lists
res = [ array.array('d') for _ in X ]
for i in xrange(1,secaxis.size):
  if condition: # see above
    co = -secaxis[i-1]/secaxis[i]
    for j in xrange(N):
      res[j].append( (X[j][i-1] + co*X[j][i])/(1+co) )
</code></pre>

<p>This is clearly very inefficient and besides not a Pythonic way.</p>

<p>Another way is to use numpy.nditer, but I haven't figured out yet how one accesses the previous value, though it allows iterating over several arrays at once:</p>

<pre><code># without secaxis = X.pop(idx)
it = numpy.nditer(X)
for vec in it:
  # vec[idx] is current value, how do you get the previous (or next) one?
</code></pre>

<p>Third possibility is to first find sought indices with efficient numpy slices, and then use them for bulk multiplication/addition. I prefer this one for now:</p>

<pre><code>res = []
inds, = numpy.where((secaxis[:-1] &lt; 0) * (secaxis[1:] &gt; 0) +
                   (secaxis[:-1] &gt; 0) * (secaxis[1:] &lt; 0))
coefs = -secaxis[inds] / secaxis[inds+1] # array of coefficients
for f in X: # loop is done only N-1 times, that is, 3 to 6
    res.append( (f[inds] + coefs*f[inds+1]) / (1+coefs) )
</code></pre>

<p>But this is seemingly done in 7 + 2*(N - 1) passes, moreover, I'm not sure about <code>secaxis[inds]</code> type of addressing (it is not slicing and generally it has to find all elements by indices just like in the first method, doesn't it?).</p>

<p>Finally, I've also tried using itertools and it resulted in monstrous and obscure structures, which might stem from the fact that I'm not very familiar with functional programming:</p>

<pre><code>def filt(x):
  return (x[0] &lt; 0 and x[1] &gt; 0) or (x[0] &gt; 0 and x[1] &lt; 0)
import array
from itertools import izip, tee, ifilter
res = [ array.array('d') for _ in X ] 
iters = [iter(x) for x in X]   # N-1 iterators in a list
prev, curr = tee(izip(*iters)) # 2 similar iterators, each of which
                               # consists of N-1 iterators
next(curr, None) # one of them is now for current value
seciter = tee(iter(secaxis))
next(seciter[1], None)
for x in ifilter(filt, izip(seciter[0], seciter[1], prev, curr)):
  co = - x[0]/x[1]
  for r, p, c in zip(res, x[2], x[3]):
    r.append( (p+co*c) / (1+co) )
</code></pre>

<p>Not only this looks very ugly, it also takes an awful lot of time to complete.</p>

<p>So, I have following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Of all these methods is the third one indeed the best? If so, what can be done to impove the last one?</li>
<li>Are there any other, better ones yet? </li>
<li>Out of sheer curiosity, is there a way to solve the problem using nditer?</li>
<li>Finally, will I be better off using memmap versions of numpy arrays, or will it probably slow things down a lot? Maybe I should only load <code>secaxis</code> array into RAM, keep others on disk and use third method?</li>
<li>(bonus question) List of equal in length 1-D numpy arrays comes from loading N <code>.npy</code> files whose sizes aren't known beforehand (but N is). Would it be more efficient to read one array, then allocate memory for one 2-D numpy array (slight memory overhead here) and read remaining into that 2-D array?</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>if settings.DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'].find('postgresql') != -1:

else:

<p>The reason for this is that we are using PostgreSQL ip4r extension which allows nice (and fast) work with fields containing IP values. But we also have dummy implementations (in Python code) for other databases, so that development can be done also in SQLite. So if you are using PostgreSQL those fields are backed up with fields using ip4r indexes and if you are using some other database system those fields are regular fields.</p>

<p>The problem is how to use South migrations on such fields. The problem is that <code>add_introspection_rules</code> discovers <code>fields_postgresql</code> and <code>fields_dummy</code> so this leaks to migrations. This is the problem later on if you want to apply a migration made with SQLite on an installation with PostgreSQL.</p>

"39187220","1","","<p>I have been working on a personal ""how-to"" guide, chronicling and keeping a journal of my studies as I go along. </p>

<p>I now have a, almost too long block of code that, when I've encountered this length of code myself, its always frustrating trying to highlight JUST the block without it highlighting the whole page, or not enough. </p>

<p>So, my question is, for <code>rst</code> (reStructuredText) <code>.. code-block::</code>'s, is there an add-on or a way to add in a <code>copy</code> button, for automatic highlighting or automatically adding the text to the users clipboard? Or would this be a more html-literal type of code I'd have to include in the build and reference it in the code block? If so, what would something like that look like as well?</p>

"7802504","1","","<p>I am building a web application that allows a user to upload an image. When the image is uploaded, it needs to be resized to one or more sizes, each of which needs to be sent to Amazon s3 for storage. Metadata and urls for each size of the image are stored in a single database record on the web server. I'm using a message queue to perform the resizing and uploading asynchronously (as there is potential for large images and multiple resizes per request). When the resize/upload task completes, the database record needs to be updated with the url. </p>

<p>My problem is that the worker executing the task will not have access to the database. I was thinking of firing off a http callback from the worker back to the web application after the task is complete with the appropriate information for updating the database record. Are there any other alternatives or reasons I should do this another way?</p>

<p>I'm using python/pylons for the web backend, mysql for the database and celery/amqp for messaging.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"15680809","1","","<p>I've been working on a event based AJAX application that stores recurring events in the a table in the following format (Django models):</p>

<pre><code>event_id = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=24)
# start_date - the start date of the first event in a series
start_date = models.DateTimeField()
# the end date of the last event in a series
end_date = models.DateTimeField()
# Length of the occurence
event_length = models.BigIntegerField(null=True, blank=True, default=0)
rec_type = models.CharField(max_length=32)
</code></pre>

<p>The rec_type stores data in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>[type]_[count]_[day]_[count2]_[days]#[extra]

type - the type of repeation: 'day','week','month','year'.
count - the interval between events in the “type” units.
day and count2 - define a day of a month ( first Monday, third Friday, etc ).
days - the comma-separated list of affected week days.
extra - the extra info that can be used to change presentation of recurring details.
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>day_3___ - each three days
month _2___ - each two month
month_1_1_2_ - second Monday of each month
week_2___1,5 - Monday and Friday of each second week 
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, and allows many events to be transmitted concisely, but I now have the requirement to extract all events that occur during a given range. For example on a specific date, week or month and I am a bit lost as to how best to approach. </p>

<p>In particular, I am stuck with how to check if an event with a given recurrence pattern is eligible to be in the results.</p>

<p>What is the best approach here?</p>

"39186984","1","","<p>I'm trying to use NetBeans 8.1 with Cygwin to write, compile and debug a C program. I knew nothing about C when I started this, and somehow found my way to fixing all the compiler errors. But when it came time to debug there was no debugger!  Long story short, there's no gdb.exe in the Cygwin/bin directory and even a fresh install of Cygwin didn't produce one.</p>

<p>I tried another gcc compiler that did have gdb, but Netbeans won't use it.</p>

<p>I really don't know anything about debugging C in Netbeans with Cygwin. All I wanted to do was just bash my way through this one C program because I need to access a C library.</p>

<p>Alternatively, does anyone know if and how to run a C subroutine in python? (A vastly superior language to C/C++, in my opinion.)</p>

<p>I would be delighted to get access to this C library from either NetBeans or rewrite my access code in python.</p>

"15680593","1","","<p>I try to understand how to handle 1D array (vector in linear algebra) with numpy. In the following example, I generate two numpy.array a and b:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np

<p>The following command also works and gets me the correct prompt.  There must then be an issue with pymssql.</p>

<pre><code>sudo TDSVER=7.1 tsql -H asdf.database.windows.net -p 1433 -U adf@ad -P adsf#adf -D adf
</code></pre>

<p>So I'm fighting with my pymssql and freetds drivers.</p>

<p>Platform Versions Etc:</p>

<p>Ubuntu 16.04</p>

<p>FreeTDS v0.91 (used by working tsql)</p>

<p>FreeTDS v0.95 (used by pymssql)</p>

<p>pymssql v2.1.3</p>

<p>Target Database: SQL Azure (latest)</p>

<p>Instructions for install: <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-develop-python-simple/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-develop-python-simple/</a></p>

<p>I've gone into every freetds.conf file I can find: /etc/freetds/freetds.conf ; /root/.freetds.conf</p>

<p>I have set the global TDS version to 8.0.  I have overwritten from the python perspective in my pymssql.connect to overwrite the version to 8.0</p>

<pre><code>import os
os.environ['TDSDUMP'] = 'stdout'
import pymssql  
conn = pymssql.connect(server='adsf.database.windows.net', 
                   user='asdf@adfs', 
                   password='asdf#adfad', 
                   database='asdd',
                   tds_version='8.0',
                   )
</code></pre>

<p>I run the diagnostics tools:</p>

<p>tsql -C and get back 4.2 as the version</p>

<p>I run the code dumping the logs to stdout, and notice, the version is 7.1.</p>

<p>net.c:202:Connecting to 191.238.6.43 port 1433 (TDS version 7.1)</p>

<p>The following tsql command works for me...</p>

<pre><code>sudo TDSVER=8.0 tsql -H asdf.database.windows.net -p 1433 -U adf@ad -P adsf#adf -D adf
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the version number.  Its 8.0.  I can validate I get data back and can do all I want with this.</p>

<p>So there is an obvious issue here with how pymssql is hooking up with freetds.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is an init.py file which uses the initialize_sql (and this function defines Base.metadata.bind = engine). In one of my model classes I would like to use the autoload=true option (using the declarative base), but I always get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>sqlalchemy.exc.UnboundExecutionError: No engine is bound to this Table's MetaData. Pass an engine to the Table via autoload_with=&lt;someengine&gt;, or associate the MetaData with an engine via metadata.bind=&lt;someengine&gt;

<p>Actually Base.metadata.bind = engine is defined inside the initialize_sql function and I do not realy know in which order the file are loaded, but I'm almost sure that that init.py is loaded before the model, and thus metadata was already binded to the engine...</p>

The basic framework for what I originally set out to do has  been laid. In addition, however, I'd like to visualize in real time the data that's being acquired. To that end, I was thinking of using Python and its various plotting libraries. My question is how difficult it would be to let Python have access to what is essentially a first in, first out circular buffer of my C program. For concreteness, let's assume there are 1024 samples in this buffer. Does the idea of ""letting Python have a continuous peek at dynamic C array"" even sound reasonable/possible?

<p>Well, Now let's imaging <code>class D2</code> is a combination of 5 pieces of <code>B</code> and 3 pieces of <code>C</code>, and <code>class D3</code> is made of <code>D2</code> plus an additional <code>C</code>(with different parameter than the ones in <code>D</code>), and <code>D4</code> is made of <code>D2</code> and 2 additional pieces of <code>C</code>(these 2 additional <code>C</code> has same parameter but different from the ones in <code>D2</code>). It seems <code>D2</code> is good to use composition, but <code>D3</code> is good to use inheritance of <code>D2</code> and <code>C</code>, and <code>D4</code> is good to use inheritance of <code>D2</code> and <code>C</code>. </p>

<p>Use combinations, to me, has the disadvantage that I have to write <code>d.c.c1</code> rather than <code>d.c1</code>(as in inheritance case)to get the parameter <code>c</code> or I need to store the parameter <code>c</code> in D directly(besides the one as <code>d.c.c1</code>). Is there any philosophical consistent way to deal with these classes? Thanks!</p>

        is_training = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.bool, shape=(),
                                     name='is_training')

print('Eval inputs: %.3f' % time_inputs(get_eval_inputs))

"15682025","1","","<p>I have 2 tables TBL1 and TBL2.  </p>

<p><code>TBL1</code> has 2 columns <code>id</code>, <code>nSql</code>.<br>
<code>TBL2</code> has 3 columns <code>date</code>, <code>custId</code>, <code>userId</code>.<br>
I have 17 rows in TBL1 with id 1 to 17. Each nSql has a SQL query in it.  </p>

<p>For example nSql for</p>

<p>id == 1 is: <code>""select date, pId as custId, tId as userId from TBL3""</code><br>
id == 2 is: <code>""select date, qId as custId, rId as userId from TBL4""</code> ...  </p>

<p>nSql result is always same 3 columns.</p>

<p>Below query runs and puts data into the table TBL2. If there is already data in TBL2 for that day, I want the query to replace the data with new data.
If there is not data in TBL2, I want to put data in normal way.</p>

<p>For example, if I run the query in the morning and if I want to run it again in evening, I want new data to replace old data for that day, since data will be inserted into TBL2 everyday. </p>

<p>It is also precaution that if the data already exists (if run by coworker), I do not want duplicate data for that day.</p>

<p>Now I am supposed to run following code at some moment in time:</p>

<pre><code>resp, content = h.request('https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis/analytics/v3/rest?quotaUser=the_name_of_your_app_goes_here')

<p>And then save the value for content in the datastore. The issue explains this is not user-bound, however it is not clear to me if I should run this once and store the value until eternity, or refresh it at certain moments in time.</p>

<p>In addition, since I am handling authorization a bit different, I have the feeling I will run into issues there as well if I implement it the exact same way. Cause when I build the service, I actually add the credentials in the call:</p>

<pre><code>http = credentials.authorize(httplib2.Http())

"15685174","1","","<p>I'm not so familiar with SQL. I have a table with over 100 columns. What is the best way to insert data from a dictionary into the corresponding column of my table (key and column names are identical)? </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>My SQL Table</p>

<p>Column1 Column2 Column3 Column4 Column5  </p>

<p>My data which I get from a dictionary:</p>

<p>First Data set</p>

<p>Column2:apple, Column4:tree</p>

<p>Second Data set</p>

<p>Column1:banana, Column2:blue, Column3:green, Column4:house, Column5:red</p>

<p>So if the key of the dictionary is identical to the column name of the table, the data should be inserted. I know how to do this for a single query but how can I do this (clever) for a large number of queries?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>What I would do at a single level and some clarifications:</p>

<p>1) Create a SQL Table with all 120 columns but without any data.
2) I have about 500 word files which contain a part of the data which should go into the database (about 5-10 from the 120 columns). 
3) So I have to read them, parse them and if the key of the data in the dictionary match any of the 120 column names, the value should be inserted.
3) Single mode:</p>

<pre><code>if key == 'Column1':
</code></pre>

<p>sql = INSERT INTO Column1 
valuexy</p>

<p>This is of course very stupid for 500 files and 120 columns. I hope this was more clear.</p>

Or is there a way, where there are ready maps available and i can just plot my trajectories on them and include them in my web-based GUI and provide the user to enter epsilon radius and do the same stuff as i mentioned above. how to go ahead? please suggest.</p>

"49455","1","","<p>Although the <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF specification</a> is available from Adobe, it's not exactly the simplest document to read through.  PDF allows documents to be encrypted so that either a user password and/or an owner password is required to do various things with the document (display, print, etc).  A common use is to lock a PDF so that end users can read it without entering any password, but a password is required to do anything else.</p>

<p>I'm trying to parse PDFs that are locked in this way (to get the same privileges as you would get opening them in any reader).  Using an empty string as the user password doesn't work, but it seems (section 3.5.2 of the spec) that there has to be a user password to create the hash for the admin password.</p>

<p>What I would like is either an explanation of how to do this, or any code that I can read (ideally Python, C, or C++, but anything readable will do) that does this so that I can understand what I'm meant to be doing.  Standalone code, rather than reading through (e.g.) the gsview source, would be best.</p>

"31391665","1","","<p>In the context of a model I'm generating, I at one point need to generate a probability distribution from a an array of real numbers.

<pre><code>arr = [value_1, value_2, ..., value_n]

<p>Now, these values are <strong>proportional</strong> to probabilities I next need to use in a multinomial sampling procedure, so the obvious approach is simply this:</p>

<p>But this (sometimes) doesn't work! Basically the sum of arr/arr.sum() ends up being greater than 1. In principle this should be mathematically impossible, but I'm assuming this boils down to a floating-point precision issue. Here's a trivial example of how this can happen:</p>

<p>Ok, Thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14908363/using-pymunk-with-pyinstaller"">Using Pymunk with Pyinstaller</a> .

<p>This all packages no problem. The image loads fine as long as I have the dll next to the exe so I dont error. I confirmed the dll was in by comparing before and after versions of including the dll. 160 kb difference. Then I used this to check if the dll was in the current path when launched under Pyinstallers exe environment.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    print os.listdir(sys._MEIPASS).count(""chipmunk.dll""),""dlls""
except:
    #not in pyinstaller

</code></pre>

<p>I get an exact <code>1 dlls</code> on output but pymunk complains it couldn't find it. Its in the _MEIPASS <code>PATH</code> dir so how come pymunk can't find it? The dll is in the root so no searching should be required. How can I get pymunk to search the right location?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>However, when I open the <em>'play_wave.py'</em> example from <em>/pyaudio/test</em>, the audio is so slow and garbled that is useless for any application.</p>

<pre><code>""""""PyAudio Example: Play a wave file.""""""

import pyaudio
import wave

CHUNK = 1024

#if len(sys.argv) &lt; 2:
#    print(""Plays a wave file.\n\nUsage: %s filename.wav"" % sys.argv[0])

    data = wf.readframes(CHUNK)

# stop stream (4)
stream.stop_stream()
stream.close()

# close PyAudio (5)
p.terminate()
</code></pre>

<p>To reproduce a similar poor quality on your laptop/PC, just make the CHUNK = 1 (the output is pretty similar on my Ubuntu)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Additional information:</strong></h1>

<p><strong>What I tried:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1-</strong> Another Raspberry Pi B+.</p>

<p><strong>2-</strong> Change the audio samples per buffer:</p>

<p>As I was supposing the problem was the audio samples per buffer (the CHUNK variable in this example), I made a loop to increment the CHUNK by 1 and played the audio for each increment. I could notice a slight difference for some CHUNK values, but nothing even close to the quality that I get when I play it by aplay. However, I could notice a big difference between this two files:</p>

<p>1- police_s.wav = 8 bits , 22000Hz, Mono , 176 kb/s -> Way better than the beat.wav played by the same CHUNK (2048)</p>

<p>2- beat.wav = 16bits , 44100Hz, Stereo, 1411 kb/s</p>

<p>When I play the same audio through the example <em>/pyaudio/test/play_wave_callback.py</em>, the output is almost perfect, excepting some interruptions at the end of the audio. So I saw that it doesn't set the CHUNK. It uses the <em>frame_count</em> parameter in the callback function, so I printed it and saw that it was 1024 ¬¬, the same default value that came with the example <em>/pyaudio/test/play_wave.py</em> and that results in a garbled audio.</p>

<p><strong>3-</strong> pyaudio 0.2.4:
Since <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=103190&amp;p=715696&amp;hilit=pyaudio&amp;sid=0c83a5c77d4bf10b94f4b641c6c149f8#p715696"" rel=""nofollow"">hayderOICO</a> mentioned he was using pyaudio 0.2.4 and said ""I'm using PyAudio fine."", I decided to give a try on that older version but I got the same result...</p>

<p><strong>4-</strong> Added   <em>disable_audio_dither=1</em>   to config.txt</p>

<p><strong>I'm using:</strong> &nbsp;  &nbsp; Raspberry Pi B+  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Raspbian    &nbsp;  &nbsp; python 2.7.3   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   pyaudio v0.2.8  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  portaudio19-dev   &nbsp; &nbsp;   TRRS analog audio</p>

<p><strong>How I installed everything:</strong></p>

<p><em>1st try:</em></p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install python-dev python-numpy cython python-smbus portaudio19-dev
$ git clone http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/git/pyaudio.git
$ cd pyaudio
$ sudo python setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p><em>2nd try:</em></p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
</code></pre>

<p><em>3rd try:</em></p>

<p>From GitHub: <a href=""https://github.com/jleb/pyaudio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jleb/pyaudio</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's very frustrating having the library's example not working properly on Pi. I don't think it's a hardware limitation since the same audio plays well with aplay and other libraries like pygame and SDL2.</p>

<p>I am new to Raspberry Pi and audio programming, so I hope to be doing something stupid...
As I am already using a specific wrapper for pyaudio, I really would like to keep using it instead of moving to another library...
I appreciate any help, suggestions and advice.</p>

I will load all the files into a single data frame, note in an additional column where the records originated from (filename), drop the additional columns and finally have pandas deduplicate via <a href=""http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.duplicated.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.duplicated.html</a>
In the last step, I write the deduplicated files back to disk based on the filename-identifier column.</p>

<pre><code># ASSUMPTION: files are in order, first file defines minimum common columns
path = '.'
files_in_dir = [f for f in os.listdir(path)if f.endswith('csv')] 
isFirst = True

for filenames in fs.find('*.csv', path):
    df = pd.read_csv(filenames, error_bad_lines=False)
    df['origin'] = fs.add_suffix(filenames, '_deduplicated')
    if (isFirst):
        isFirst = False
        bigDf = df
    else:
        bigDf = pd.concat(bigDf, df, axis=0, join='inner')
cols_for_dup = [col for col in bigDf.columns if col not in ['origin']]
bigDf.duplicated(subset=cols_for_dup).sum()
bigDf.duplicated().sum()
bigDf_withoutNA = bigDf.drop_duplicates(keep='first', subset= cols_for_dup)

grouped = bigDf_withoutNA.groupby('origin')
for name, group in grouped:
    #filename = 'path' + name
    group.to_csv(path_or_buf= name, sep=';', decimal=',')
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a simpler approach to this?</p>

"23540135","1","","<p>I need to make fields with autocomplete for my custom forms. It's just a drop-down menu with matched cities, countries etc. I also use django-cities for that. So, I subclassed AutocompleteModelBase. Here, I can declare search_fields attribute with list of fields from model, on which the search will be applied. But what if I want to search not by the fields, but by, for example, info from related managers? In django-cities, there is special related manager for so-called alternative names. It returns queryset with names for some geo object in 
foreign languages. Something like this: <code>Country.objects.get(code='US').alt_names.filter(language='de')</code></p>

<p>So, I need to search by the results of such operations. Not by the fields of the model, but by translated names, which don't belong to actually fields. Thanks.</p>

"7821613","1","","<p>I'm writing a blog editor using pyqt4.  My issue is this.  There is a wysiwyg editor tab and a html code editor tab.  A change done in one should reflect in the other.  One option is to use the setHtml and toHtml functions whenever text changes in a qtextedit.  But the issue with this approach is that when I use setHtml on a qtextedit, all the previous edit undo history is lost.  If I try to maintain my own history on textchanged signal, lots of memory will be used.  Consider I enter a sentence, textchanged will be signaled for every single character and undo would be character by character.</p>

<p>I tried sharing the same qtextdocument between the two qtextedits but that also failed as highlighting is linked to the qtextdocument and hence is applied to both qtextedits.</p>

<p>Another option is to do nothing when the user works in the wysiwyg editor window.  When the user  makes some edit in the html code editor, I'll wait till the user finishes the edit and then once done, I'll find the diff of the edit and somehow, make a corresponding edit change in the wysiwyg editor's qtextdocument.  Is this achievable?  How can I do such a change in the qtextdocument?  Is there a more simple way that I am not aware of?</p>

<p>and found that it didn't work either.</p>

<p>so I've resorted to creating a temp folder, uncompressing to it, and reading the conf file there.  I would really like to avoid this if possible as the conf files are the only limiting factor. I can (and am) loading the python modules from the zip file just fine at this point.</p>

<p>I can get the raw text of the file if there's a way to pass that directly to configparser, but searching the docs I came up empty handed.</p>

<p>Update:
I tried using stringIO as a file object, and it seems to work somewhat.
configparser doesn't reject it, but it doesn't like it either.</p>

"23540309","1","","<p>I want to extract certain information from a large file using python.

The first input file (input_file) is the data file, which is a 3-column tab-separated file that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>engineer-n imposition-n 2.82169386609e-05
motor-n imposition-n 0.000102011705117

<pre><code>bomb-n
sedation-n
roadblock-n
surrender-n
</code></pre>

<p>The third input file (colB_file) is also a 1-column list (idential to colA_file with different information), which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>adjective-n
homeless-n
imposition-n
oppression-n
</code></pre>

<p>I want to extract information from the input file that is found in both colA and colB.
With the example data that I have provided, this would mean filtering all of the information except for the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>bomb-n imposition-n 0.000680302090112
sedation-n oppression-n 0.000397074586994
roadblock-n oppression-n 5.96190620847e-05

<pre><code>def test_fnc(input_file, colA_file, colB_file, output_file):
    nounA = []
    with open(colA_file, ""rb"") as opened_colA:
        for aLine in opened_colA:
            nounA.append(aLine.strip())
            #print nounA

    nounB = []
    with open(colB_file, ""rb"") as opened_colB:
        for bLine in opened_colB:
            nounB.append(bLine.strip())
            #print nounB

    with open(output_file, ""wb"") as outfile:
        with open(input_file, ""rb"") as opened_input:
            for cLine in opened_input:
                splitted_cLine = cLine.split()
                #print splitted_cLine
                if splitted_cLine[0] in nounA and splitted_cLine[1] in nounB:
                    outstring = ""\t"".join(splitted_cLine)
                    outfile.write(outstring + ""\n"")

test_fnc(input_file, colA_file, colB_file, output_file)
</code></pre>

<p>However, it only outputs 1-line, as if it is not iterating over the list inputs provided.
It also seems that my lists are being appended upon each other, starting with one item and incrementing itself with each appended item.
Thus, I have also tried to reference the lists as follows:</p>

        nounB = bLine

<p>with the same result as above.</p>

"23540310","1","","<p>I'm trying to create a n by n array of objects with NumPy and here are my problems: Let's assume the dimension of the array are set to <code>m=n=3</code>. To each element of I would like to assign an instance of my class <code>Vector</code>, which is a n-dimensional vector type. </p>

<p>In my first attempt I tried to assign a 2-dim. vector in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>    array_size = 4
    np.array([ 
          [ Vector(1,2) for j in xrange(array_size) ] 
          for i in xrange(array_size) ], dtype=object)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of an array of <code>Vector</code> instances Python returns:</p>

<pre><code>[[[1 2]
  [1 2]
  [1 2]]

 [[1 2]
  [1 2]
  [1 2]]

 [[1 2]
  [1 2]
  [1 2]]]
</code></pre>

<p>The above is an array of shape <code>(3, 3, 2)</code>, not of <code>(2, 2)</code>. Numpy converted the <code>Vector</code>instances to a third array dimension. This is not what I wanted, so I tried another thing:</p>

<p>I first defined an empty object array and then assigned the instances to it:</p>

<pre><code>    array_size=3
    mx = np.empty([array_size, array_size], dtype=object).astype(list)

    for i in xrange(array_size):
        for j in xrange(array_size):
            mx[i][j] = Vector(1,2)
</code></pre>

<p>The funny thing about it is that I have to cast the array to a list. Then it works pretty well and returns exactly what I need:</p>

<pre><code>[[&lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt; &lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt; &lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt;]  
 [&lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt; &lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt; &lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt;]  
 [&lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt; &lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt; &lt; Vector: [1, 2] &gt;]]
</code></pre>

<p>It is then possible to cast the list back to an array. So, the array can(!) hold objects in the way I want it to. But there seems to be no straightforward way to assign the instances. And, isn't there a more pythonic to do it? I really want to get rid of this nested loop.</p>

<p>I also tried out <code>np.nditer</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    array_size=3
    mx = np.empty([array_size, array_size], dtype=object)

    for i in np.nditer(mx, flags=[""refs_ok""], op_flags=[""writeonly""]):
        i[...] = Vector(1, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of an array, this one returns an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ValueError: assignment to 0-d array</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which I do not understand.</p>

<p>Does anybody have a good solution concerning the nested loop? An explanation of the value error would also be welcome.</p>

"7822101","1","","<p>I find it very interesting the way how SQLAlchemy constructing query strings, eg:</p>

<pre><code>(Session.query(model.User)
        .filter(model.User.age &gt; 18)
        .order_by(model.User.age)
        .all())
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I can see, there applied some kind of <strong>Proxy Pattern</strong>. In my small project I need to make similar string construction using OOP approach. So, I tried to reconstitute this behavior.</p>

<p>Firstly, some kind of object, one of plenty similar objects:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeObject(object):
    items = None

    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def __call__(self):
        return ' '.join(self.items) if self.items is not None else ''

    def a(self):
        self.items.append('a')
        return self

    def b(self):
        self.items.append('b')
        return self
</code></pre>

<p>All methods of this object return <strong>self</strong>, so I can call them in any order and unlimited number of times.</p>

<p>Secondly, proxy object, that will call subject's methods if it's not a <strong>perform</strong> method, which calls object to see the resulting string.</p>

<pre><code>import operator

class Proxy(object):
    def __init__(self, some_object):
        self.some_object = some_object

    def __getattr__(self, name):
        self.method = operator.methodcaller(name)
        return self

    def __call__(self, *args, **kw):
        self.some_object = self.method(self.some_object, *args, **kw)
        return self

    def perform(self):
        return self.some_object()
</code></pre>

<p>And finally:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; obj = SomeObject()
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = Proxy(obj)
&gt;&gt;&gt; print p.a().a().b().perform()
a a b
</code></pre>

<p>What can you say about this implementation? Is there better ways to make the desirable amount of classes that would make such a string cunstructing with <strong>the same syntax</strong>?</p>

<p>PS: Sorry for my english, it's not my primary language.</p>

"51502","1","","<p>I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p>

<p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p>

<p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()
   #-- while --
#-- if --

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.</p>

"51553","1","","<p>I need a real DBA's opinion. Postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my Macbook Pro while Java and Python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms (350,000 rows):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT count(id), avg(a), avg(b), avg(c), avg(d) FROM tuples;
</code></pre>

<p>Is this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?</p>

<p>The schema (the table holds responses to a survey):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE tuples (id integer primary key, a integer, b integer, c integer, d integer);

\copy tuples from '350,000 responses.csv' delimiter as ','
</code></pre>

<p>I wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):</p>

<pre><code>java   1.5 threads ~ 7 ms    
java   1.5         ~ 10 ms    
python 2.5 numpy   ~ 18 ms  
python 2.5         ~ 370 ms
</code></pre>

<p>Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)</p>

<p>Tunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):</p>

<pre><code>increased the shared memory available to Postgres to 256MB    
increased the working memory to 2MB
disabled connection and statement logging
used a stored procedure via CREATE FUNCTION ... LANGUAGE SQL
</code></pre>

<p>So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.</p>

<hr>

<p>No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>

<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>

<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>

<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>

<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>

<pre><code>column = grt.root.wb.doc.physicalModels[0].catalog.schemata[0].tables[1].columns[7]
column.flags = ['UNSIGNED']
column.simpleType.flags = ['UNSIGNED']
</code></pre>

<p>but I get a <code>TypeError: flag is read-only</code>. I also tried setting the dataType property of the column to a reference to the dataType property of a column having the <code>UNSIGNED</code> flag (defined through GUI).</p>

<p>Finally I tried :</p>

<pre><code>column.setParseType('TINYINT(1) UNSIGNED')
</code></pre>

<p>but it returns 0 and doesn't change anything (it returns 1 if I remove <code>UNSIGNED</code> so I think it doesn't work with flags).</p>

<p>Is there any way to change column flags (ie: <code>UNSIGNED</code>, <code>ZEROFILL</code>) using a Python script in MySQL Workbench?</p>

police 562.0

<p>and so on.... till Topic 100 with the same format. </p>

<p>Here the first line is the topic number and it's weight. The following are the words in that topics and their weights in that topic. </p>

<p>I want to find the probability of each of the word. That is divide each of the word's weight with it's respective topic weight. For example, </p>

<pre><code>In topic 1, the word Mr weight is 2288.0 and it's topic weight is 87187.0. So, the probability of the word Mr in Topic 0 is 2288.0/87187.0. Likewise I would like to know the probability of all the words. 

My output should be like:

TOPIC:  1 87187.0

Mr 0.02624 
's 0.01872
@card@ 0.0129
</code></pre>

<p>and so on... where these values are the results of the word's weight/the topic weight. </p>

<p>If it is a normal column division then, I would have used col2/col1 technique but this quite challenging. So, please guide me. Thanks in advance!</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r--  1 ubuntu ubuntu  47872 Jul 13 04:39 admin_email.py
-rw-r--r--  1 root   root    48212 Feb 10 03:12 admin_email.pyc
</code></pre>

<p><code>admin_email.pyc</code> has been deleted. Only <code>admin_email.py</code> remains on there server.</p>

<p>Here is the code that is executing the script that has been changed:</p>

<pre><code>from xxx.admin_email import send_email_admins
...
g = lambda x, y, z: send_email_admins(x, y, z)
...
threading.Thread(target=g, args=(order_id, request.user.email, form.cleaned_data)).start()
</code></pre>

<p>The application is being served with <code>gunicorn</code> + <code>nginx</code>.</p>

<p>Any ideas on what the issue is? Why is a new <code>.pyc</code> file being created? More importantly why is the applications behavior not being updated?</p>

<p>I want to access 'aaa' from my code either I mention aaa while giving the input in caps or small after running my python code it should return me aaa is the right item

<p>And if I provide the list like :</p>

<blockquote>

<p>it gives me the result as :</p>

<p>As you must be see in above result aaa is coming as valid count (active item count : 2) because its available in /location/data.txt file. but also its coming as AAA-MC is wrong item name (2nd line from above result). I want '-mc or -MC' to ignore with any item present or non present in /location/data.txt file. </p>

<p>Understanding how a radiobutton in a Tkinter menu works</p>

<p>I have a radio button inside the options menu as so:

v = BooleanVar()

v.set(True)

options.add_radiobutton(label=""change pop up"", command =togglePopUp,variable=v,onvalue=True,offvalue=False)
</pre>

<p><code>togglePopUp</code> is a function that changes the value of variable <code>v</code> from <code>True</code> to <code>False</code> or vice versa. Main window is already opened and this menu will be added later to the window. This is just the fragment of code that is related to the radiobutton. </p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>Now my question is when I press the radiobutton (after running the code) will the value of the variable be changed or will the function togglePopUp be called? If the function will be called then what will happen to the status of the radiobutton? will the status of the radiobutton be updated instantly or will there be a delay? </p>

<p><strong>research</strong></p>

<p>I read about the radiobutton and the Boolean variable from the Tkinter book at effbot.org. But I was not convinced about how it worked. I tried a program but I am not getting the output that I essentially want. So I decided to understand how it works at a deeper level. </p>

"31393286","1","","<p>I want a list of URLs that will download artifacts from Artifactory. The list of URLs should come from a REST query. </p>

<p>I am successfully calling the Artifactory (3.2.2) REST API for various data I need. In one case, I am doing a property search, searching for artifacts with an ""application_name"" and ""release_version"". These properties were added by TeamCity when the artifacts were deployed. I can successfully search Artifactory using the Artifactory Property Search tool in the web console, and I can successfully search with those same terms from my python script. </p>

<p>The REST call returns json. Within that json is an array of dicts, and each of those is a {uri: url}. All good, but not quite.</p>

<p>The URL returns a 404 when pasted into a web browser. By walking thru the url, I discover that the /api/storage part is what's throwing off the browser. I suspect that's because this URI is not meant for browsers, but for another REST query. Sheesh. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+REST+API#ArtifactoryRESTAPI-PropertySearch"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> is not clear on this. It sure seems like I should be able to get a proper browser URL from a REST call.</p>

<p>Example URL: ""<a href=""http://ourserver.org:8081/artifactory/api/storage/our-releases/com/companyname/Training/1.7.4/Training.ipa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ourserver.org:8081/artifactory/api/storage/our-releases/com/companyname/Training/1.7.4/Training.ipa</a>""</p>

<p>It's easy to replace ""/api/storage"" with ""/simple"" in that URL string and that makes the URL work in a browser. I just think it's an ugly solution. I mostly think I'm missing something, perhaps obvious. </p>

<p>I also need those patients to link to the individual patient pages. So if I click on Bob's patient 'C755' I will be directed to that patient's page. I was thinking something like: </p>

<p>So to run this as part of the RPM install I added the following to the spec file:</p>

<pre><code>%post
# collect static files
pushd .
cd %{installpath}/src/app/
%{__python} manage.py collectstatic --noinput --settings=settings_prod
popd
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that when I run this, I can see the task being kicked off:</p>

<pre><code> sudo rpm -U app-0.2.8.18889M-1.x86_64.rpm -vv

"31396074","1","","<p>I am working with PyZMQ and I have what seems to be a rather peculiar issue. I have two classes that are wrapping sockets for communication, <code>MZLSubscriber</code> and <code>MZLRequester</code>. There is a class that contains both of them, <code>MZLLink</code>. For each of these, I also have tests <code>MZLSubscriberTest</code>, <code>MZLRequesterTest</code>, and <code>MZLinkTest</code>. The tests for the subscriber and requester work as they should, but <code>MZLinkTest</code> does not receive any subscriber messages.</p>

<p>Below is what seems to be the relative code, which are the constructors for the 3 classes as well as <code>run()</code> for <code>MZLSubscriber</code> and the tests for <code>MZLink</code> and <code>MZLSubscriber</code>.</p>

<p><code>MZLink</code> Constructor:</p>

<pre><code>    # Host information
    self.host = host
    self.requestPort = requestPort
    self.subscriberPort = subscriberPort

    # Set up zmq context
    self.zmq_context = zmq.Context()

    # Set up subscriber and replier
    self.subscriber = MZLSubscriber(self.zmq_context, self.host, self.subscriberPort)
    self.requester = MZLRequester(self.zmq_context, self.host, self.requestPort)

    # Start subscriber
    self.subscriber.start()
</code></pre>

<p><code>MZLink</code> Test:</p>

<pre><code># Constants
HOST = ""localhost""
REQ_PORT = 5555
SUB_PORT = 5556

# Create Link
link = MIDASZMQLink(HOST, REQ_PORT, SUB_PORT)

link.close()
</code></pre>

<p><code>MZLRequester</code> Constructor:</p>

<pre><code>    # Initialize class member variables
    self.zmq_context = zmq_context
    self.host = host
    self.port = port

    # Set up reply socket
    self.socket = self.zmq_context.socket(zmq.REQ)

    # Connect socket
    self.socket.connect(""tcp://{0}:{1}"".format(self.host, self.port))
</code></pre>

<p><code>MZLSubscriber</code> Constructor:</p>

<pre><code>   # Initialize parent process
    Process.__init__(self)

    # Store zmq context and connection host/port
    self.zmq_context = zmq_context
    self.host = host
    self.port = port

    # Sockets. Don't set them up here because sockets are not thread safe
    self.socket = None

    # Queue to store data in
    # TODO: Make queue not overflow if events come in too quickly
    self.queue = Queue()
</code></pre>

<p><code>MZLSubscriber.run()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    # Parent call
    Process.run(self)

    # Set up subscriber socket in this thread
    self.socket = self.zmq_context.socket(zmq.SUB)
    self.socket.setsockopt_string(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, unicode())

    # Connect socket
    self.socket.connect(""tcp://{0}:{1}"".format(self.host, self.port))

    # While the thread is alive, poll for data to put into queue
    # Calling MZLSubscriber.stop() will automatically change this
    while self.is_alive():
        datum = self.socket.recv()
        self.queue.put(datum)

    # Disconnect and close socket.
    #FIXME: Doesn't get here because terminate() immediately stops the process
    self.socket.disconnect(""tcp://{0}:{1}"".format(self.host, self.port))
    self.socket.close()
</code></pre>

<p><code>MZLSubscriber</code> Test:</p>

<pre><code># Host information
HOST = ""localhost""
SUBSCRIBER_PORT = ""5556""

# Set up zmq context
zmq_context = zmq.Context()

# Set up subscriber
subscriber = MZLSubscriber(zmq_context, HOST, SUBSCRIBER_PORT)

# Start subscriber
subscriber.start()

# Stop and join subscriber
subscriber.close()
subscriber.join()
</code></pre>

<p>The subscriber thread seems to block at <code>datum = self.socket.recv()</code>, which makes me think it could be some issue with the socket creation. However, it does seem to work when only working with the subscriber. The requester seems to work in both cases. In addition, everything goes smoothly by just commenting out the two lines dealing with <code>requester</code>.</p>

<p>I apologize for the wall of code, but I can't even narrow what code the issue is coming from at this point. When I do, I'll remove the irrelevant code. The test code that deals with the incoming data has been removed.</p>

<p>As a bit of clarification, I am using Python 2.7 with PyZMQ 14.3.1.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It seems that running <code>MZLSubscriber</code> in the main thread rather than creating another <code>Process</code> results in the expected result, so it seems that this could be some sort of thread safety. To my knowledge, zmq contexts are thread-safe, but sockets are not. I thought this wouldn't cause an issue because I'm explicitly making sure there is a socket for each thread.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> If the calls setting up the socket in <code>MZLSubscriber</code> are moved from <code>run()</code> to <code>__init__</code>, the socket seems to receive a small portion of the published message, but does have an error:</p>

<pre><code>Process MZLSubscriber-1:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/process.py"", line 258, in _bootstrap

</code></pre>

<p>I have gotten a workaround to this by creating a new <code>zmq.Context</code> in <code>MZLSubscriber.run()</code>, although I feel that this shouldn't be necessary if zmq contexts are thread-safe.</p>

"23558320","1","","<p>I have been using the logging module in Python for a while. My doubt is not so much a technical one, but that I am not sure of the best practices with the messages. The issue is that sometimes an event happens and I want to dump information about it in the log, but a lot of information. I can build a single long string, and use it in an log.info() command. That is alright, except for the fact that the result is hardly human-readable. Introducing the character '\n' in the string indeed breaks the message into separate lines in the log file, but left-justified, it looks ugly because in the beginning of the logging formatter I am writing the date/time, user, etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand I can split the message into different calls to log.info(), but that makes it look as if they were different events.</p>

<pre><code>len(G.edges(CurrentNode))

<p>and I can get the number of edges, but I'm not sure how to apply this to list as a path.  For example, I can add this number as an attribute but I don't think attributes are taken into consideration when finding a path and because I'm adding this after the edges are connected, I cannot add the weights to the edges themselves. The other problem is the higher the score the more I want the path to be followed but with edges I think it follows the lowest weighted edge.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what approach do other people take to find paths based on certain characteristics of the node?  If someone knows how to do this for networkx, great! but I think networkx has many features so if I can get the theory or general approach I'm sure I can find a way to do it in python.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Sorry I might be explaining it wrong.  I understand I can add attributes to nodes, but I'm not sure how to make path decisions based on those attributes.  So in my case, based on certain conditions I am adding edges between nodes. Each group of nodes represents a different day(day1data.., day2data.., day3data..), so I'm connecting a few nodes from day1 to nodes on day2 only if certain rules are matched.    Once I have the edges connected, I want those ones to be considered more heavily when choosing a path.  So I added an attribute 'weight' to each node of the current day which is basically the total number of edges connecting that node.
My problem is, the weight attribute is not used in any of the path decision making because its an attribute I created and labeled myself(I could create a label named 'abc'='hello world' and it would apply that attribute to the node).  How can I get this weight to be considered when creating the path(the edges are already created so I don't think I can go back and recreate them)?</p>

"23558567","1","","<p>A small problem with the Caeser Cypher program I'm writing. I'm new to programming.</p>

<p>So, when the offset points to a character past 126 I want to wrap back to the beginning, so that it works with the ASCII character set. I've managed to do that while encrypting like this:</p>

<pre><code>   if encryption &gt; 126:
       encryption = encryption - 94
</code></pre>

<p>Which works fine. But while decrypting, it doesn't seem to work. I'm still getting characters that are outside of the ASCII character set. E.g:</p>

<pre><code>Please enter string to decrypt: abcdefg
Please enter offset value (1 to 94): 93
Decrypted string:
 ¾¿ÀÁÂÃÄ

<p>Here is the code I've written:</p>

<pre><code>   for letter in range(len(messageD)):

       decryption = ord(messageD[letter])
       decryption += offsetD

       if decryption &lt; 32:
           decryption = decryption + 94

       decryption = chr(decryption)
       decryptedD += decryption

   print('Decrypted string:\n', decryptedD)

<p>If the subtracted offset results in a number less than 32, we're supposed to add 94 to the result. I thought that is exactly what I've done here, but I must be going wrong somewhere. </p>

<p>It's also not decrypting strings properly. I can encrypt strings, but when I try to decrypt the string I just encrypted, it returns the wrong result.</p>

<p>The latency seems to be linearly increasing which makes sense, but it seemed to increase TOO quickly. After doing a lot of tinkering and profiling, I found that the bottleneck was the queries.</p>

<p>At the start of the benchmark, the queries would process and return quickly under 10-50ms, but it quickly increased and in some cases latencies of 10000-15000 ms were being seen.  </p>

<p>I couldn't figure out why the db was slowing down so much especially since it is empty (barring test data).  </p>

<p>I tried running the application WITHOUT a connection pool, and the results showed that latency went down (7-9s to 5-6s). I did not think this was possible because everything I read suggested having a connection pool will always make things faster because you avoid the overhead of establishing a new connection every time you make a request.   </p>

<p>I also experimented with INCREASING the connection pool size (from the default 5 to 50), and that decreased latency even more than the pool-less setup(5-6s to 3-4s).   </p>

"15718887","1","","<p>I am writing a simple text based adventure game in python.  I will include all of the code because I have no idea what the problem is (it isn't too long and it's quite simple).  </p>

<p>In order to save, I am writing to a text file the name of the 'currentRoom' and each item in 'you.inventory'.  Then when I load I am using 'readline()' to retrieve that data and reset the variables.  I've got a ""game loop"" where I get the next command and perform whatever function matches the command.  When I wrote the following code for 'load', it wouldn't work correctly.  To test the save/load, I start the game pick up a few items and then go north to get into a position that is not the starting room, and save.  Then I quit, run the game again, enter the same name of course, and then give command 'load'.  Note, the saved file is correct.  I even included a print statement in the load function that prints currentRoom.name, and it's correct, but then when I call the look function and it does the exact same 'print currentRoom.name', I've been moved back to the starting room!?  Interestingly, the inventory is loaded fine, just the location is wrong.  I can't figure it out for the life of me.</p>

<p>In order to fix this, I had to move the load() function into the game loop body, under 'elif com == ""load""..., rather than calling it as a function, and then it works!?  I suspect I'm doing something wrong with global vs local variables, but I can't see what.</p>

"31410010","1","","<p>I'm using py.test to execute a suite of selenium tests.  I'm essentially running a collector in my conftest.py that generates tests like this (I stole this from the pytest documentation):</p>

<pre><code>def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):
    funcarglist = metafunc.cls.cases[metafunc.function.__name__]
    argnames = list(funcarglist[0])
    metafunc.parametrize(argnames, [[funcargs[i] for i in argnames]
                                for funcargs in funcarglist])
</code></pre>

<p>My test cases are placed in objects that look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class TestObject(object):

def __init__(
        self,
        parameter_1,

):
    self.parameter_1 = parameter_1
    self.parameter_2 = parameter_2
</code></pre>

<p>I instantiate them something like this:</p>

<pre><code>test_cases_values = {
    ""friendly_case_name_1"": TestObject(
        ""parameter_1_value"",
        ""parameter_2_value""
    ),
    ""friendly_case_name_2"": TestObject(
        ""parameter_1_value"",
        ""parameter_2_value""
    ),
}
</code></pre>

<p>My browsers are attached to a grid server, I make a list of them like this:</p>

<pre><code>BROWSERS = [
    ""('browser_1', SERVER_URL)"",
    ""('browser_2', SERVER_URL)""
]
</code></pre>

<p>I store the target environment in a config file that is an instantiation of an object like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Environment(object):

    def __init__(self, url=URL, port=PORT):
        self.url = url
        self.port = port

    def __name__(self):
        return self.url + "":"" + self.port

ENVIRONMENT = Environment()
</code></pre>

<p>Then I have a test class that creates a list of test cases like this - the test object parameters are actually strings that allow for self generating code.  I'm oversimplifying as I pass them in as fill ins to broader exec statements:</p>

<pre><code>class TestClass(object):

    cases = {""test_function"": []}
    for i in test_cases.values():
        for j in BROWSERS:
            cases[""test_function""].append(
                dict(
                    browser=j,
                    environment=ENVIRONMENT
                    test_object=i
                )
            )

    @pytest.mark.run()
    def test_function(
        self,
        browser,
        environment,
        test_object
    ):
        exec(test_object.parameter_1)
        exec(test_object.parameter_2)
        assert my_assertion
</code></pre>

<p>When the collector runs, it looks like this:
    <pre>collected # items
    &lt;Module 'tests.py'&gt;
      &lt;Class 'TestClass'&gt;
        &lt;Instance '()'&gt;
          &lt;Function ""test_function[environment0-test_object0-('browser_1', GRID_SERVER)]""&gt;
          &lt;Function ""test_function[environment1-test_object1-('browser_2', GRID_SERVER)]""&gt;
          &lt;Function ""test_function[environment2-test_object2-('browser_1', GRID_SERVER)]""&gt;
          &lt;Function ""test_function[environment3-test_object3-('browser_2', GRID_SERVER)]""&gt;
</pre></p>

<p>I want to have the collector work in such a way that I get back useful information about each item - I've messed around with setting __str__, __repr__, and __name__ methods in various places but haven't had the results I expected.  I'd like to be able to roll this into reporting - there are over 200 tests that this generates in production and I have to trace through stack traces currently to figure out exactly what was being tested for each failure.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure where I'm making my mistakes here, should I modify my implementation of pytest_generate_tests, or the way I'm creating my TestClass, or set up the cases in a different way?  Ideally, I want something that can be mapped back via an ORM to include test metadata as well.</p>

"31409884","1","","<p>I'm in need of a Meijer G function in scipy. I read somewhere on the internet that due to its generality, the Meier G function is not supported as a special function in scipy, but everyone should write something up according to his personal use case.</p>

<p>My problem is that I have no experience whatsoever with complex integration. As LaTeX is forbidden here, here's what I'm trying to solve numerically:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/MKtMq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p><em>(the first line being the general case, the second line my case that I'm trying to compute), with p(a), k, k2 given</em></p>

<p>As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_G-function#Definition_of_the_Meijer_G-function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wikipedia states</a>, there are three ways to get <code>L</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>L runs from −i∞ to +i∞ such that all poles of Γ(bj − s), j = 1, 2, ..., m, are on the right of the path, while all poles of Γ(1 − ak + s), k = 1, 2, ..., n, are on the left.</li>
<li>L is a loop beginning and ending at +∞, encircling all poles of Γ(bj − s), j = 1, 2, ..., m, exactly once in the negative direction, but not encircling any pole of Γ(1 − ak + s), k = 1, 2, ..., n. </li>
<li>L is a loop beginning and ending at −∞ and encircling all poles of Γ(1 − ak + s), k = 1, 2, ..., n, exactly once in the positive direction, but not encircling any pole of Γ(bj − s), j = 1, 2, ..., m. </li>
</ul>

<p>How do I get <code>L</code> and solve the integral? The way I'm used to compute integrals over the reals is to</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
myL = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
densityL = myL[1] - myL[0]
myIntegral = (F(myL)*densityL).sum()

Pyplot does have a menu where you can edit line properties to change the color or style, but its rather clunky when you want to hide lines to isolate the one you're interested in.  Ideally, I'd like to use checkboxes on the legend to show and hide lines.

"31410356","1","","<p>Firstly, sorry if this is a bit lengthy, but I wanted to fully describe what I have having problems with and what I have tried already.</p>

<p>I am trying to join (merge) together two dataframe objects on multiple conditions. I know how to do this if the conditions to be met are all 'equals' operators, however, I need to make use of LESS THAN and MORE THAN.</p>

<p>The dataframes represent genetic information: one is a list of mutations in the genome (referred to as SNPs) and the other provides information on the locations of the genes on the human genome. Performing df.head() on these returns the following:</p>

<h3>SNP DataFrame (snp_df):</h3>

<pre><code>   chromosome        SNP      BP
0           1  rs3094315  752566
1           1  rs3131972  752721
2           1  rs2073814  753474
3           1  rs3115859  754503
4           1  rs3131956  758144
</code></pre>

<p>This shows the SNP reference ID and their locations. 'BP' stands for the 'Base-Pair' position.</p>

<h3>Gene DataFrame (gene_df):</h3>

<pre><code>   chromosome  chr_start  chr_stop        feature_id
0           1      10954     11507  GeneID:100506145
1           1      12190     13639  GeneID:100652771
2           1      14362     29370     GeneID:653635
3           1      30366     30503  GeneID:100302278
4           1      34611     36081     GeneID:645520
</code></pre>

<p>This dataframe shows the locations of all the genes of interest. </p>

<p>What I want to find out is all of the SNPs which fall within the gene regions in the genome, and discard those that are outside of these regions.</p>

<p>If I wanted to merge together two dataframes based on multiple (equals) conditions, I would do something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>merged_df = pd.merge(snp_df, gene_df, on=['chromosome', 'other_columns'])
</code></pre>

<p>However, in this instance - I need to find the SNPs where the chromosome values match those in the Gene dataframe, and the BP value falls between 'chr_start' and 'chr_stop'. What makes this challenging is that these dataframes are quite large. In this current dataset the snp_df has 6795021 rows, and the gene_df has 34362.</p>

<p>I have tried to tackle this by either looking at chromosomes or genes seperately. There are 22 different chromosome values (ints 1-22) as the sex chromosomes are not used. Both methods are taking an extremely long time. One uses the <code>pandasql</code> module, while the other approach is to loop through the separate genes.</p>

<h3>SQL method</h3>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import pandasql as psql

pysqldf = lambda q: psql.sqldf(q, globals())

q           = """"""
SELECT s.SNP, g.feature_id
FROM this_snp s INNER JOIN this_genes g
WHERE s.BP &gt;= g.chr_start
AND s.BP &lt;= g.chr_stop;
""""""

all_dfs = []

for chromosome in snp_df['chromosome'].unique():
    this_snp    = snp_df.loc[snp_df['chromosome'] == chromosome]
    this_genes  = gene_df.loc[gene_df['chromosome'] == chromosome]
    genic_snps  = pysqldf(q)
    all_dfs.append(genic_snps)

all_genic_snps  = pd.concat(all_dfs)
</code></pre>

<h3>Gene iteration method</h3>

<pre><code>all_dfs = []
for line in gene_df.iterrows():
    info    = line[1] # Getting the Series object
    this_snp = snp_df.loc[(snp_df['chromosome'] == info['chromosome']) &amp;
            (snp_df['BP'] &gt;= info['chr_start']) &amp; (snp_df['BP'] &lt;= info['chr_stop'])]
    if this_snp.shape[0] != 0:
        this_snp = this_snp[['SNP']]
        this_snp.insert(len(this_snp.columns), 'feature_id', info['feature_id'])
        all_dfs.append(this_snp)


all_genic_snps = pd.concat(all_dfs)

<p><strong>Question :</strong> instead of specifying ""names"" of the columns using Designinfo (which basically makes my code less re-usable) , can I not READ the names given by this DesignMatrix so that I can feed this into a DataFrame later, without needing to know pre-hand what the ""reference level/control group"" level was ?</p>

<p>ie. When I do 
dmatrix(""C(carbs, Treatment(reference='lo')) + score"", dta)</p>

<pre><code>""""""
# How can I get something like this with dmatrix's output without hardcoding ?

g=DataFrame(dmatrix(""carbs + score"", dta),columns=names)

<pre><code>def uploadProfilePicture(self, image):

<p><code>from google.appengine.api import images</code> (is this all i need?)</p>

"15720273","1","","<p>I have a wrapper to redirect outputs when I call python python-wrapped C++. </p>

<p>The basic idea is to use <code>dup</code> and <code>dup2</code>, which are the only ways I've been able to catch the <code>printf</code> outputs from the C++. The wrapper works fine with no calls to <code>flush()</code> as long as I'm running the job interactively, but when I send the job to a TORQUE batch I get the unwelcome outputs again. </p>

<p>My understanding, in part from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/8804893/915501"">this question</a>, is that some well-placed <code>flush()</code> calls should fix this, but where exactly do they need to go?

"87522","1","","<p>We are mainting a web application that is built on Classic ASP using VBScript as the primary language. We are in agreement that our backend (framework if you will) is out dated and doesn't provide us with the proper tools to move forward in a quick manner. We have pretty much embraced the current webMVC pattern that is all over the place, and cannot do it, in a reasonable manner, with the current technology. The big missing features are proper dispatching and templating with inheritance, amongst others.</p>

<p>Currently there are two paths being discussed:</p>

<ol>
<li>Port the existing application to Classic ASP using JScript, which will allow us to hopefully go from there to .NET MSJscript without too much trouble, and eventually end up on the .NET platform (preferably the MVC stuff will be done by then, ASP.NET isn't much better than were we are on now, in our opinions). This has been argued as the safer path with less risk than the next option, albeit it might take slightly longer.</li>
<li>Completely rewrite the application using some other technology, right now the leader of the pack is Python WSGI with a custom framework, ORM, and a good templating solution. There is wiggle room here for even django and other pre-built solutions. This method would hopefully be the quickest solution, as we would probably run a beta beside the actual product, but it does have the potential for a big waste of time if we can't/don't get it right.</li>
</ol>

<p>This does not mean that our logic is gone, as what we have built over the years is fairly stable, as noted just difficult to deal with. It is built on SQL Server 2005 with heavy use of stored procedures and published on IIS 6, just for a little more background.</p>

<p>Now, the question. Has anyone taken either of the two paths above? If so, was it successful, how could it have been better, etc. We aren't looking to deviate much from doing one of those two things, but some suggestions or other solutions would potentially be helpful.</p>

Now I want to go through this dict, test if one of these things shown above is there and replace it with the right thing like this:</p>

"31411330","1","","<p>I'm trying to solve an overdetermined system in Python, using the <code>numpy.solve</code> function. I know the value of one of the variables and I know that in theory I can find a unique solution for the system if I can somehow plug in that known value.</p>

<p>My system is of the form <code>AxC=B</code>. The variables are split into two groups, one group of N variables and one of T variables (although this does not matter for the math). A is a <code>(T*N x T+N)</code> matrix, C is the variables vector, of length <code>(T+N)</code>, and B is a vector of length <code>(T*N)</code>.</p>

<p>How do I tell <code>numpy.solve</code> (or another function in Python, but please don't recommend least squares, I need the unique, exact solution, which I know exists) to use the known value of one of the variables?</p>

<p>A simple example of my system would be:</p>

<pre><code>|1 0 0 1 0|     |n1|     |B1|
|1 0 0 0 1|     |n2|     |B2|
|0 1 0 1 0|  X  |n3|  =  |B3|
|0 1 0 0 1|     |t1|     |B4|
|0 0 1 1 0|     |t2|     |B5|
|0 0 1 0 1|              |B6|  
</code></pre>

<p>The values of the elements of B would of course be known, as well as the value of one of the variables, let's say I know that <code>t1=1</code>. The dots don't mean anything I just put them there so the characters wouldn't bunch up.</p>

<p>My main issue is that I am unfamiliar with how I get python to give me a range of dates (here being the year 2013, but it could also be just any increment in time such as June 2011 to December 2014) and of course to print the day of the week next to it. This way it could be adapted to any time period you might need this small calendar for. I was thinking maybe assigning every day's number (1 being Monday, 2 being Tuesday is the pattern if I'm correct) the first 3 letters of a day in the week so it's all neat and of the same length. </p>

"39224501","1","","<p>I have developed a desktop client using PyQt4, it connect to my web service by <a href=""http://www.python-requests.org/en/master/"" rel=""nofollow"">requests</a> lib. You know, <a href=""http://www.python-requests.org/en/master/"" rel=""nofollow"">requests</a> maybe one of the most useful http client, I think it should be no problem. My desktop client works all right until something strange happened. </p>

<p>I use the following code to send request to my server.</p>

<pre><code>response = requests.get(url, headers = self.getHeaders(), timeout=600, proxies = {}, verify = False)
</code></pre>

<p>where header only includes auth token.</p>

<pre><code> def getHeaders(self, additional = None):
    headers = {
               'Auth-Token' : HttpBasicClient.UserAuthToken,
               }
    if additional is not None:
        headers.update(additional)
    return headers
</code></pre>

<p>I cannot connect to my web service, all the http request pop the same error ""'Cannot connect to proxy.', error(10061, '')"". For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GET Url: http://  api.fangcloud.com/api/v1/user/timestamp
  HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.fangcloud.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/v1/user/timestamp (Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.', error(10061, '')))</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this API does nothing but return the timestamp of my server. When I copy the url into Chrome in same machine with same environment, it returns correct response. However, my desktop client can only returns error. Is it anything wrong with requests lib?</p>

<p>I googled this problem of connection error 10061 (""No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it""). This maybe caused by TCP connect rejection of web server.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The client sends a SYN packet to the server targeting the port (80 for HTTP). A server that is running a service on port 80 will respond with a SYN ACK, but if it is not, it will respond with a RST ACK. Your client reaches the server, but not the intended service. This is one way a server could “actively refuse” a connection attempt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why? My client works all right before and Chrome still works. I use no proxy on my machine. Is there anything I miss?</p>

"7847089","1","","<p>I've just begun learning sockets with Python. So I've written some examples of chat servers and clients. Most of what I've seen on the internet seems to use threading module for (asynchronous) handling of clients' connections to server. I do understand that for scalable server you need to use some additional tricks, because thousands of threads can kill the server (correct me if I'm wrong, but is it due to GIL?), but that's not my concern at the moment.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that I've found somewhere in Python documentation that creating subprocesses is the right way (unfortunelty I've lost the reference, sorry :( ) for handling sockets.</p>

<p>So the question is: to use threading or multiprocessing? Or is there even better solution?</p>

<p>Please, give me the answer and explain the difference to me.</p>

<p><strong>By the way:</strong> I do know that there are things like Twisted which are well-written. 
I'm not looking for pre-made scalable server, I am instead trying to understand how to write one that can be scaled or will deal with at least 10k clients.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> The operating system is Linux.</p>

"31414782","1","","<p>This is more of general ""where do I find good resources to do something"" question.  I am attempting to use Python (OpenCV or otherwise) to classify images based on a training set.</p>

<p>My training set:  this is made up of numerous images of product defects.  Each image can be taken in 1 of 3 locations on the product and each image will contain 1 of 5 types of product defects.  The defects have been manually classified and validated by a human.</p>

<p>Images to classify:  These are made up of similar images, taken in the same 3 locations but the type of defect is not classified (although the defective area IS recognized by the tool taking the picture, it's just that the tool does not CORRECTLY classify them and I can't change the tool). </p>

<p>I have attempted to do this classification following recommendations in the book Programming Computer Vision with Python:  Tools and algorithms for analyzing images.  In this case I use SIFT descriptors stored in a mySQL database (training data) in a Bag of Words approach.  So far I am not having too much luck (I continue to troubleshoot) and thought I'd seek advice from any OpenCV experts out there.</p>

<p>Any references or advice would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>So, coming back to the question I thought that it would be worth sharing what I've learned.  I don't know that it's ""the answer"" but this is where I've ended up.  A work in progress, you can always get better.</p>

<p>My solution right now has been to combine 3 different approaches.  All are searchable on the internet so I won't go to great detail on the how.  </p>

<p>First, I used the SIFT approach, generating SIFT histograms using a command line call to VLFeat.  This may be an option elsewhere in Python, it's just what I used.  I used k-means clustering to do the visual bag of words vocabulary thing and built a database tying the centroid's to word histograms associated with the training images.  I improved results a bit by adding a Root SIFT step.  Then I created a separate database using Dense SIFT (but no Root SIFT adjustments).  Lastly, I created a database of color histograms based on the RGB components of the training images.  I don't use all 256 bins of RGB but went with summing individual R,G and B values over 8 bins and then flattening the values to a 24 bin histogram.</p>

<p>This same process is followed with the unknown images, and then histogram vectors are compared using Euclidean distance.  I tried Chi Squared comparison as well but, in my case Euclidean provided better results.  I take the top 3 results from each process, with image classification based on 5 of 9 vote.  If a majority isn't reached then the analysis is indeterminate.  </p>

<p>For my closed population of images I am at 3.1% misclassification rate, 3.1% indeterminate. </p>

Just to learn a bit, I tried to implement a matrix multiplication using scipy.weave.inline. I have not included any error handling - just trying it out to better understand it. The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>import scipy.weave
def cmatmul(A,B):
    R = numpy.zeros((A.shape[0],B.shape[1]))
    M = R.shape[0]
    N = R.shape[1]

        for (int j=0; j&lt;N; j++)
            for (int k=0; k&lt;K; k++)
                R(i,j) += A(i,k) * B(k,j);
    """"""
    scipy.weave.inline(code, ['R','A','B','M','N','K'], \
                       type_converters=scipy.weave.converters.blitz, \
                       compiler='gcc')
    return R

<p>When I compare with numpy.dot, I experience that the weave.inline version takes roughly 50x the time as numpy.dot. I know that numpy is very fast when it can be applied. The difference is even seen for large matrices such as size 1000 x 1000.</p>

<p>I have checked both numpy.dot and scipy.weave.inline and both appear to use one core 100% when computing. Numpy.dot delivers 10.0 GFlops compared to the theoretical 11.6 GFlops of my laptop (double precision). In single precision I measure the double performance as expected. But the scipy.weave.inline is way behind. 1/50 times this performance for scipy.weave.inline.</p>

<p>Is this difference to be expected? Or what am I doing wrong?</p>

<li>I'm using no shell argument (so <code>shell=false</code>) </li>
<li>In case it matters, I'm grabbing a pipe to stderr for processing it, but ignoring stdout and stdin</li>
<li>It is only for use on Windows currently, and works as expected in all other cases that I've tested so far.</li>

<p>I found a powerful Daterangepicker in Javascript : <a href=""http://www.daterangepicker.com/#ex5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.daterangepicker.com/#ex5</a> . As I have never learned js, I would like to know how to pass the start and end dates out of the widget to the views.py file...

"31427786","1","","<p>I tried to install graph-tool on Mac OSX 10.10 using homebrew. The brew build process works fine, but when I try to import graph-tool I get <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31411447/graph-tool-crahes-on-import"">the error described in this question</a>. 
Another problem with homebrew is that I always builds graph-tool for python2.7 and it installs the packages in the Python 2.7 sit-packages folder. But I want to use it with Python 3.4. These are the reasons why I tried to build graph-tool from source.</p>

<p>The <code>./configure</code> command automatically uses Python 2.7, too. So I passed it the desired Python version with <code>./configure PYTHON=python3.4</code></p>

<p>It then detects the correct version as well as the related paths but crash with the following error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>configure: error:<br>
  Could not link test program to Python. Maybe the
  main Python library has been   installed in some non-standard library
  path. If so, pass it to configure,   via the LDFLAGS environment
  variable.<br>
  Example: ./configure LDFLAGS=""-L/usr/non-standard-path/python/lib""  </p>
  
  <p>======================================================================
  ERROR! 
  You probably have to install the development version of the
  Python package for your distribution. The exact name of this package varies 
  among them.</p>
  
  <p>======================================================================</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The error occurs with and without <code>PYTHON</code> variable set.
From the output of <code>./configure</code> I can see that everything works fine except for the last line, which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>checking consistency of all components of python development
  environment... no</p>

<p>Whats does the above line mean and how do I properly install graph-tool on my maschine?</p>

"23577831","1","","<p>I am building a small micro-web application using bottle. First step is that the user inputs an ID into a form in order to retrieve a record. Once the ID has been verified as part of the SQLite database further steps will be taken, they can modify records, add data to another .db with the same PRIMARY KEY and so on and so forth. </p>

<p>My question is, within the session how do I preserve the ID once verified and pass it around the various functions. Should it be a global created inside the function that verifies the user input? I am wary of globals, just because so much junk is talked about them. Also, I am nervous that if not very well managed the user could restart the session enter new data but the global ID variable might not have been properly disposed of etc....</p>

"39238812","1","","<p>I am developing a small independent python application which uses Celery. I have built this using django framework but my application is back end only. This means that the users do not need to visit my site and my application is built only for the purpose of receiving tasks queue from celery and performing operations on the database. In order to perform operations on the database, I need to use Django modules.</p>

var source = new EventSource(""/stream"");
source.onmessage = function(e) {
    console.log(e);
};
&lt;/script&gt;

<pre><code>from flask import Flask, render_template, request, Response, redirect

<p>Everything works, except it is really slow. Given my delay of <code>time.sleep(.1)</code> I would have expected to see roughly 10 events per second on the client. It is however only one event every ~3 seconds.</p>

<p>When I increase my delay to say <code>time.sleep(5)</code>, I get an event every 8 seconds and so forth. So it looks like I have a delay of ~3 seconds between server and client, which is odd given that they run on the same machine.</p>

<p>Hopefully this makes intuitive sense.  It's a users table that has a many-to-many relationship with a permissions table as well as a many-to-many relationship with an addresses table.</p>

<p>In Python, when I perform the correct SQLAlchemy query incantations, I get back results that look something like this (after converting them to a list of dictionaries in Python):  </p>

<pre><code>results = [
    {'pk': 1, 'name': 'Joe', 'permission': 'user', 'address': 'home'},
    {'pk': 1, 'name': 'Joe', 'permission': 'user', 'address': 'work'},
    {'pk': 1, 'name': 'Joe', 'permission': 'admin', 'address': 'home'},

    {'pk': 2, 'name': 'John', 'permission': 'user', 'address': 'home'},
]

<p>So in this contrived example, Joe is both a user and and an admin.  John is only a user.  Both Joe's home and work addresses exist in the database.  Only John's home address exists.</p>

<p>So the question is, does anybody know the best way to go from these SQL query 'results' to the more compact 'desired_results' below?</p>

<pre><code>desired_results = [
    {
        'pk': 1,
        'name': 'Joe',
        'permissions': ['user', 'admin'],
        'addresses': ['home', 'work']
    },
    {
        'pk': 2,
        'name': 'John',
        'permissions': ['user'],
        'addresses': ['home']
    },
]
</code></pre>

<p>Additional information required: Small list of dictionaries describing the 'labels' I would like to use in the desired_results for each of the fields that have many-to-many relationships.</p>

<pre><code>relationships = [
    {'label': 'permissions', 'back_populates': 'permission'},
    {'label': 'addresses', 'back_populates': 'address'},
]
</code></pre>

<p>Final consideration, I've put together a concrete example for the purposes of this question, but in general I'm trying to solve the problem of querying SQL databases in general, assuming an arbitrary amount of relationships.  SQLAlchemy ORM solves this problem well, but I'm limited to using SQLAlchemy Core; so am trying to build my own solution.</p>

<p>Does <code>Contacts.objects.all()</code> get called evertime I am hitting the view ?
Or does <code>Paginator</code> maintains a state somehow ? What would the sql query look like for <code>paginator = Paginator(contact_list, 25)</code> Are there generators being used behind the scenes and things are lazily evaluated?</p>

"31428123","1","","<p>I am writing a web service using Django that will be consumed from a MS SharePoint workflow. In the SP workflow, I created a dictionary with 2 items (id:1, text:'foo'), and used this dictionary as the request content. However, instead of using the dictionary to format a traditional POST parameter list, it sends it as a JSON object in the body of the POST request, so instead of the expected:</p>

<p>in the body of the request, there is this:</p>

I saw other posts that explain how to get the raw body and parse the JSON. I was looking for a solution that would either:</p>

<li>Make SharePoint send normal data, or</li>
<li>Get Django to respect the <code>Content-type</code> header that states the data is JSON</li>

"23578230","1","","<p>Answered by Martijn Pieters. Thank you.<br>
It is because statement vs expression.
And because .join() does not mutate (is a pure function), so it needs to be assigned to a variable.</p>

<p>Question:<br>
What is the reason for this oddity?</p>

<p>Goal:</p>

<pre><code>if base == 'T':
    RNA_seq += 'U'
else:
    RNA_seq += base
</code></pre>

<p>This following method works:</p>

<pre><code># += in expression1 and .join() in expression2
RNA_seq += 'U' if base == 'T' else RNA_seq.join(base)
# Edit note: RNA_seq.join(base) works because it returns `base`
#       aka. RNA_seq += 'U' if base == 'T' else base
</code></pre>

<p>However the following does NOT work:</p>

<pre><code># Using += on both expressions
RNA_seq += 'U' if base == 'T' else RNA_seq += base
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code># Using .join() for both expressions
RNA_seq.join('U') if base == 'T' else RNA_seq.join(base)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using xpaths stored in a dictionary for maintainability and then returning the string from the label (which is also my xpath identifier).</p>

"31428368","1","","<p>I'm using a platform that, when you upload pdf's to it, converts the pdf with the base64 encode in Python. Then it stores the binary string in the database.</p>

<p>Now I want to decode the strings and write them to a local folder, so I thought to use the 'with open' structure and pass it the b parameter for binary and then it should create test.pdf based of my decoded string and write it to my desktop?
Yet this yields no results, what am I doing wrong here?</p>

"122033","1","","<p>Yesterday, I asked <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/119107/how-do-i-generate-a-list-of-n-unique-random-numbers-in-ruby"">this</a> question and never really got an answer I was really happy with. I really would like to know how to generate a list of N unique random numbers using a functional language such as Ruby without having to be extremely imperative in style.</p>

<p>Since I didn't see anything I really liked, I've written the solution I was looking for in LINQ:   </p>

<pre><code>
       static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var temp = from q in GetRandomNumbers(100).Distinct().Take(5) select q;
        }

        private static IEnumerable GetRandomNumbers(int max)
        {
            Random r = new Random();
            while (true)
            {
                yield return r.Next(max);
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Can you translate my LINQ to Ruby? Python? Any other functional programming language?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please try not to use too many loops and conditionals - otherwise the solution is trivial. Also, I'd rather see a solution where you don't have to generate an array much bigger than N so you can then just remove the duplicates and trim it down to N.</p>

<p>I know I'm being picky, but I'd really like to see some elegant solutions to this problem.
Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
Why all the downvotes? </p>

<p>Originally my code sample had the Distinct() after the Take() which, as many pointed out, could leave me with an empty list. I've changed the order in which those methods are called to reflect what I meant in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Apology:</strong><br>
I've been told this post came across as rather snobbish. I wasn't trying to imply that LINQ is better than Ruby/Python; or that my solution is much better than everyone else's. My intent is just to learn how to do this (with certain constraints) in Ruby. I'm sorry if I came across as a jerk.</p>

"23578456","1","","<p>I'm a begginer in network programming, so, sorry if my questions may appear a little obvious.</p>

<p>I'm trying to send some data from Qt application to a Python server which will process them and send back some answer.</p>

<p>the methods that allows me to send data in the <code>QTcpSocket</code> class are:</p>

<pre><code>// ...
write(const QByteArray &amp;)
write(const char *)
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>my application will manage: authentification, sending and receiving some complexe data like <code>struct</code>, and files.</p>

<p>I've many questions about this situation:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are the methods mentioned above sufficient to send complexe data, and how ?</li>
<li>how to deal with the data types in the server side (with Python) ?</li>
<li>do you think I should use an other protocole like HTTP (with the <code>QNetworkAccessManager</code> class) ?</li>

"23578596","1","","<p>I'm trying to solve a second order ODE using odeint from scipy. The issue I'm having is the function is implicitly coupled to the second order term, as seen in the simplified snippet (please ignore the pretend physics of the example):  </p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint

def integral(y,t,F_l,mass):
    dydt = np.zeros_like(y)
    x, v = y
    F_r =  (((1-a)/3)**2 + (2*(1+a)/3)**2) * v # 'a' implicit 
    a  = (F_l - F_r)/mass

    dydt = [v, a]
return dydt


y0 = [0,5]
time = np.linspace(0.,10.,21)
F_lon = 100.
mass = 1000.

dydt = odeint(integral, y0, time, args=(F_lon,mass))
</code></pre>

<p>in this case I realise it is possible to algebraically solve for the implicit variable, however in my actual scenario there is a lot of logic between <code>F_r</code> and the evaluation of <code>a</code> and algebraic manipulation fails.</p>

<p>I believe the DAE could be solved using MATLAB's <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com.au/help/matlab/ref/ode15i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">ode15i</a> function, but I'm trying to avoid that scenario if at all possible. </p>

<p>My question is - is there a way to solve implicit ODE functions (DAE) in python( scipy preferably)?  And is there a better way to pose the problem above to do so?</p>

<p>As a last resort, it may be acceptable to pass <code>a</code> from the previous time-step. How could I pass <code>dydt[1]</code> back into the function after each time-step?</p>

"31428581","1","","<p>I just tried using the IncrementalPCA from sklearn.decomposition, but it threw a MemoryError just like the PCA and RandomizedPCA before. My problem is, that the matrix I am trying to load is too big to fit into RAM. Right now it is stored in an hdf5 database as dataset of shape ~(1000000, 1000), so I have 1.000.000.000 float32 values.

"7862987","1","","<p>I've got a dozen programs that can accept input via stdin or an option, and I'd like to implement the same features in a similar way for the output.</p>

<p><strong>This part of the excercise that confuses me:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.</p>

I'm reading through <em>Python Crash Course</em> by Eric Matthes and am currently on chapter 5 but I don't recall being taught how to reject case insensitive inputs yet.</p>

<p>I know of the <code>upper()</code>, <code>lower()</code>, and <code>title()</code> string methods and I tried using:</p>

new_user.lower() == new_user.upper()

1.) upgrade to newest sorl <br>

<p>I using <strong>DDT</strong> for test parameterization <a href=""http://ddt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ddt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example.html</a></p>

<p>I want to choose and run parameterized test method from test class in <strong>PyCharm</strong> -> see example:</p>

<pre><code>from unittest import TestCase
from ddt import ddt, data


@ddt
class Test_parameterized(TestCase):
    def test_print_value(self):
        print 10
        self.assertIsNotNone(10)

    @data(10, 20, 30, 40)
    def test_print_value_parametrized(self, value):
        print value
        self.assertIsNotNone(value)
</code></pre>

<p>When I navigate to the first test method <code>test_print_value</code> in code and hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd> (or use <code>Run Unittest test_print...</code> option from context menu)
then test is executed.</p>

<p>When I try the same with parameterized test I get error:</p>

<pre><code>Test framework quit unexpectedly
</code></pre>

<p>And output contains:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/python2 /home/s/App/pycharm-community-3.1.1/helpers/pycharm/utrunner.py
/home/s/Documents/Py/first/fib/test_parametrized.py::Test_parameterized::test_print_value_parametrized true

Testing started at 10:35 AM ...

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/home/s/App/pycharm-community-3.1.1/helpers/pycharm/utrunner.py"", line 148, in &lt;module&gt;
    testLoader.makeTest(getattr(testCaseClass, a[2]), testCaseClass))
AttributeError: 'TestLoader' object has no attribute 'makeTest'

Process finished with exit code 1
</code></pre>

<p>However when I run all tests in class (by navigating to test class name in code and using mentioned run test option) all parameterized and non parameterized tests are executed together without errors.</p>

<p>The problem is how to independently run prameterized method from the test class - workaround is putting one parameterized test per test class but it is rather messy solution.</p>

"23579227","1","","<p>I'm trying to build a <code>Service</code> class that holds the <code>Registry</code> instances. The <code>Registry</code> and <code>Service</code> classes are the following;</p>

<pre><code>class Registry:

    def __init__(self, registrar):
        self.registrar = registrar

    def get(self, key):
        layers = key.split('.')
        value = self.registrar
        for item in layers:
            value = value[item]
        return value

class Service:

    instance = None

    @classmethod
    def boot(cls, object, configuration = {}):
        if cls.instance is None:
            cls.instance = object(configuration)
</code></pre>

<p>What I currently want is after the <code>boot</code> function is called, The registry functions should be accessible from <code>Service</code> class statically without defining functions in <code>Service</code> class. So, after booting with the following code, I want to use <code>get</code> function.</p>

<pre><code>Service.boot(Config, {'a' : 'b'});
Service.get('a');
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: Config object is an extension of Registry</p>

<p>I've tried <code>__getattr__</code> magic method but it doesn't work on static.
I've tried <code>__call__</code> but after that I need to call <code>Service().get()</code> which is not that I want.</p>

<p>So, is it possible to make this happen in python ? I don't want to redefine class methods in <code>Service</code> layer.</p>

<p>NOTE: In PHP, there exists <code>__callStatic()</code> function that does exactly that I want. However, I can't find an implementation on python.</p>

"15740134","1","","<p>I've tried to implement WebSocket frame unmasking algorithm (based on this: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8125507/how-can-i-send-and-receive-websocket-messages-on-the-server-side"">How can I send and receive WebSocket messages on the server side?</a>) on the server side. Here's what I've got:</p>

<pre><code>def decode(data):
    frame = bytearray(data)

    length = frame[1] &amp; 127

    indexFirstMask = 2
    if length == 126:
        indexFirstMask = 4
    elif length == 127:
        indexFirstMask = 10

    indexFirstDataByte = indexFirstMask + 4
    mask = frame[indexFirstMask:indexFirstDataByte]

    i = indexFirstDataByte
    j = 0
    decoded = []
    while i &lt; len(frame):
        decoded.append(frame[i] ^ mask[j%4])
        i += 1
        j += 1

    print decoded

    return """".join(chr(byte) for byte in decoded)
</code></pre>

<p>However I get very strange results. On JavaScript side:</p>

<pre><code>w = new WebSocket(""ws://localhost:2000"");
w.send(""test"");
w.send(""test"");
w.send(""test"");
w.send(""test"");
</code></pre>

<p>produces on the server side:</p>

<pre><code>[42, 73, 45, 46, 1, 0]
[42, 1, 98, 0, 0]
[2, 97, 0, 0]
[2, 97, 0, 0]
</code></pre>

<p>More calls to <code>w.send(""test"");</code> produces <code>[2, 97, 0, 0]</code>. Also first two arrays have length >4 (number of characters in word <code>test</code>). And none of these gets converted to word <code>test</code>. It seeems that I must be doing something wrong in my decoding code. What's causing that? Any help?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Have look at raw frames:</p>

<pre><code>[193, 134, 48, 166, 232, 11, 26, 239, 197, 37, 49, 166]
[193, 133, 57, 161, 169, 218, 19, 160, 203, 218, 57]
[193, 132, 150, 97, 124, 54, 148, 0, 124, 54]
[193, 132, 163, 26, 102, 249, 161, 123, 102, 249]
[193, 132, 238, 212, 210, 156, 236, 181, 210, 156]
</code></pre>

<p>Of course these numbers are a bit random (due to masking), but note that second byte (which is supposed to represent the length of payload) is <code>134</code>, then <code>133</code> and then always <code>132</code>. Also first two frames are longer then other frames. What's going on here?</p>

Now I need to select positions from the signal array, based on criteria. Again, I have simplified the criteria below, for sake of brevity.

<p>the shape at the top must be 1/n the size of the original shape. the shape at the second level must be 2/n the size of the original shape and so on. i.e. the shape at the bottom is the original shape.</p>

It worked well on many parts, but one small part still annoys me - the values I iterate over are sometimes stored as fields of a class which are the dictionary values, and I can't get rid of looping over my dictionary to retrieve them.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified version of my code:</p>

<pre><code>class Pair:
    def __init__(self):
        self.radius = 0.0

indices = [(x, y) for y in range(5) for x in range(5)]
d = {}
for (x, y) in indices:
    d[x, y] = Pair()
    d[x, y].radius = (x ** 2 + y ** 2) ** 0.5

sub_list = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]

values = [d[ind].radius for ind in sub_list] # &lt;-- main problem

print reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, values)
</code></pre>

<p>So the dictionary <code>d</code> have tuples <code>(x, y)</code> as keys and <code>Pair</code> instances as values, and my goal is to sum the radii of the given <code>sub_list</code> of pairs (<code>sub_list</code> could be the entire dictionary). Is there any ""broadcasting"" technique for that, or the loop in the marked line is inevitable?</p>

<p>BTW - I am a beginner, so any useful comment about the code (including styling and Pythonish will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.</p>
  
  <p>To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in <strong>calculator mode</strong>).</p>

"23580003","1","","<p>I'm working on Windows environment and with Arduino.
I have a python script, not written by me, that uses the serial port of linux. 
Since I work on Windows I should convert this code in order to let it work on windows to configure and then use the serial port used by the Arduino attached at the pc. My port is the COM15.i uses windows 7 32 bit. My python distribution is the 2.7.5 and i have installed the pyserial module 32 bit.
The piece of code of interest is the following:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self,

    self.interval = interval
    self.ser = serial.Serial(baudrate=bps,
                             parity=serial.PARITY_NONE,
                             stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE,
                             bytesize=serial.EIGHTBITS)

    devs = glob.glob(port + ""*"")

    for dev in devs:

        logging.debug(""attaching to port %s!"", dev)
        return

raise RuntimeError(""unable to configure serial port"")
</code></pre>

<p>The ""DEFAULT_DEVICE"" variable is the one that define the serial port. It is defined as :</p>

<pre><code>DEFAULT_DEVICE = '/dev/ttyACM'  
</code></pre>

<p>I think I should simply modify this variable in the format for the serial in windows in order to make the script work  and correctly configure the serial. Searching online I have found that simply putting:</p>

<pre><code>DEFAULT_DEVICE = 'COM15'
</code></pre>

<p>it should work. I have tried in this way but when launching the code I get the raise RuntimeError(""unable to configure serial port"") defined in the code.
Any idea of the problem? Maybe the format I give to DEFAULT_DEVICE variable is not correct or maybe I should modify something else in the code above. 
Thank you for every help.</p>

"23580009","1","","<p>I have the following problem.
Lets say this is my CSV</p>

<pre><code>id f1 f2 f3
1  4  5  5
1  3  1  0
1  7  4  4
1  4  3  1
1  1  4  6
2  2  6  0
..........
</code></pre>

<p>So, I have rows which can be grouped by id. 
I want to create a csv like below as an output.</p>

<pre><code>f1 f2 f3 f1_n f2_n f3_n f1_n_n f2_n_n f3_n_n f1_t f2_t f3_t
4  5  5   3   1    0    7      4      4      1   4     6  
</code></pre>

<p>So, I want to be able to chose the number of rows I will grab to convert into columns (always starting from the first row of an id). In this case I grabbed 3 rows. 
I will also then skip one or more rows (in this case only one skip) to take the final columns from the last row of the same id group. And for reasons, I want to use a data frame.</p>

<p>After struggling for a 3-4 hours. I found out a solution as given below.
But my solution is very slow. I have about 700,000 rows and may be around 70,000 groups of ids. The code above at model=3 takes almost an hour on my 4GB 4 Core Lenovo. I need to go to model = maybe 10 or 15. I am still novice in Python and I am sure there can be several changes that will make this fast. Can some one explain deeply how I can improve on the code. </p>

<p>Thanks a ton.</p>

<p>model : number of rows to grab</p>

<pre><code># train data frame from reading the csv
train = pd.read_csv(filename)

# Get groups of rows with same id
csv_by_id = train.groupby('id')

modelTarget = { 'f1_t','f2_t','f3_t'}

# modelFeatures is a list of features I am interested in the csv. 
    # The csv actually has hundreds
modelFeatures = { 'f1, 'f2' , 'f3' }

coreFeatures = list(modelFeatures) # cloning 


selectedFeatures = list(modelFeatures) # cloning

newFeatures = list(selectedFeatures) # cloning

finalFeatures = list(selectedFeatures) # cloning

# Now create the column list depending on the number of rows I will grab from
for x in range(2,model+1):
    newFeatures = [s + '_n' for s in newFeatures]
    finalFeatures = finalFeatures + newFeatures

# This is the final column list for my one row in the final data frame
selectedFeatures = finalFeatures + list(modelTarget) 

# Empty dataframe which I want to populate
model_data = pd.DataFrame(columns=selectedFeatures)

for id_group in csv_by_id:
    #id_group is a tuple with first element as the id itself and second one a dataframe with the rows of a group
    group_data = id_group[1] 

    #hmm - can this be better? I am picking up the rows which I need from first row on wards
    df = group_data[coreFeatures][0:model] 

    # initialize a list
    tmp = [] 

    # now keep adding the column values into the list
    for index, row in df.iterrows(): 
        tmp = tmp + list(row)


    # Wow, this one below surely should have something better. 
    # So i am picking up the feature column values from the last row of the group of rows for a particular id 
    targetValues = group_data[list({'f1','f2','f3'})][len(group_data.index)-1:len(group_data.index)].values 

    # Think this can be done easier too ? . Basically adding the values to the tmp list again
    tmp = tmp + list(targetValues.flatten()) 

    # coverting the list to a dict.
    tmpDict = dict(zip(selectedFeatures,tmp))  

    # then the dict to a dataframe.
    tmpDf = pd.DataFrame(tmpDict,index={1}) 

    # I just could not find a better way of adding a dict or list directly into a dataframe. 
    # And I went through lots and lots of blogs on this topic, including some in StackOverflow.

    # finally I add the frame to my main frame
    model_data = model_data.append(tmpDf) 

# and write it

"31429663","1","","<p>In my python application I have a big list (now with almost 9000 indexes). I need to find the two most similar items in this list. So, what I have now is something like:</p>

<pre><code>aux1 = 0
aux2 = 1
min_distance = 0xffff

weights = get_weights()

for i in range(0, len(_list)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(_list)):

        obj1 = _list[i]
        obj2 = _list[j]
        dist = 0

        for key in self.__fields:
            dist += weights[key] * (obj1[key] - obj2[key]) ** 2

        if dist &lt; min_distance:
            min_distance = dist
            aux1 = i
            aux2 = j

return aux1, aux2, min_distance
</code></pre>

<p>In the code, <code>weights</code> is a dict, <code>obj1</code> and <code>obj2</code> are both objects in which the <code>__getitem__</code> is implemented and the return value also comes from  a dict. And <code>self.__fields</code> is a list with the selected fields (it has now 9 items).</p>

<p>My problem is, this loop is taking too much time to complete. Even after 5 hours, the <code>i</code> variable still in the first 100th list items.</p>

<p>With this next silly code, I come to the conclusion that the problem is not the size of the list (the silly code finishes with 5 minutes of difference).</p>

<pre><code>count = 0
total = 9000

for i in range(0, total):
    for j in range(i + 1, total):
        for k in range(0, 10):
            count += 1

print(""Count is "" + str(count))
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, the problem seems to be in the most internal loop of my code:</p>

<pre><code>            for key in self.__fields:
                dist += weights[key] * (obj1[key] - obj2[key]) ** 2
</code></pre>

<p>I know Python, but I'm not a Python specialist. I conclude that the access to the values of three objects through their key is a slow operation. Some time ago, I saw in some blog that list comprehensions and/or lambda operations can be faster.</p>

<p>So, my question is: how do I make this most internal loop faster using list comprehensions and/or lambda? Feel free to give any other advice if you want.</p>

"23583743","1","","<p>I have a list (actually I'd like to make it a 1D numpy array) whose first and last element will remain constant but whose other elements are objects of an optimisation, i.e will change often and need to be in a separate variable (because <code>scipy.optimize.leastsq()</code> needs it that way).
So I've got this code to put the constant ""outer"" elements together with the changing ones:</p>

<pre><code>b_0 = 1      # this will stay constant
b_n = 10     # this as well

def _b(b_0, b_n, b_in):
    import numpy as np            
    b = np.zeros((b_inner.shape[0]+2))
    b[0] = b_0
    b[-1] = b_n
    b[1:-1] = b_in
    return(b)

&gt;&gt;&gt; b_in = range(2,10)
&gt;&gt;&gt; _b(b_0, b_n, b_in)   #returns array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
</code></pre>

<p>This looks very unelegant to me, and I'm convinced there must be a way to do this in just one line that defines</p>

<pre><code>b = np.array([b_0, somefunction(b_in), b_n])
</code></pre>

<p>For background, I need this because I have an error function for leastsq that takes a 1D array of which only the inner elements are optimized. I am feeding the result of the above to a lambda function, together with other parameters to the error function, so that I can pass only the stuff that changes to leastsq:</p>

<pre><code>err_func = lambda b_in: error_function(_b(b_0,b_n,b_in), other_parameters)

b_in_0 = range(2,10)   # starting guess
target = scipy.optimize.leastsq(err_func, b_in_0)

<p>because I am using the same error function for different types of optimisation (there are different aspects and different types of constraints that the function can be fitted to), I do not want to re-write the error function for a specific purpose.</p>

<p>Of these, only four (<code>FrameworkDir</code>, <code>FrameworkSDKDir</code>, <code>VCInstallDir</code> and <code>VSInstallDir</code>) are set in the environment used for build-events.</p>

<p>As Brian mentions, user-defined Macros can be defined such as to be set in the environment in which build tasks execute.  My problem is with the built-in Macros.</p>

<p>I use a Visual Studio Post-Build Event to run a python script as part of my build process.  I'd like to pass the entire set of Macros (built-in and user-defined) to my script in the environment but I don't know how.  Within my script I can access regular environment variables (e.g., Path, SystemRoot) but NOT these ""Macros"".  All I can do now is pass them on-by-one as named options which I then process within my script.  For example, this is what my Post-Build Event command line looks like:</p>

<pre>
    postbuild.py --t=""$(TargetPath)"" --c=""$(ConfigurationName)""
</pre>

<p>Besides being a pain in the neck, there is a limit on the size of Post-Build Event command line so I can't pass dozens Macros using this method even if I wanted to because the command line is truncated.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to pass the entire set of Macro names and values to a command that does NOT require switching to MSBuild (which I believe is not available for native VC++) or some other make-like build tool?</p>

"31433391","1","","<p>I try to read a video file with pygame.movie module but everytime i tried i got a black screen with no errors even the sound works. I'm using a mpeg file.
My version of python is 3.3.0x64 pygame 3.3x64.
I tried with python 2.7.1 x32 and 2.7 x32 pygame but same problem.</p>

<p>Here is an exemple of code that i used:</p>

<pre><code>import pygame
from time import sleep
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((1080,720))
movie = pygame.movie.Movie(""output.mpeg"")
movie.play()
while True:
    if not(movie.get_busy()):
        print(""rewind"")
        movie.rewind()
        movie.play()
    if pygame.QUIT in [e.type for e in pygame.event.get()]:
        break
</code></pre>

<p>I really need to be able to play videos, i don't know how to do to solve this problem if someone knows the solution or has python setup that works with pygame.movie module please tell me</p>

"130618","1","","<p>I would like to find out if a particular python datetime object is older than X hours or minutes. I am trying to do something similar to:  </p>

<pre><code>if (datetime.now() - self.timestamp) &gt; 100
# Where 100 is either seconds or minutes
</code></pre>

<p>This generates a type error. </p>

<p>What is the proper way to do date time comparison in python? I already looked at <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/WorkingWithTime"" rel=""noreferrer"">WorkingWithTime</a> which is close but not exactly what I want. I assume I just want the datetime object represented in seconds so that I can do a normal int comparison. </p>

<p>Please post lists of datetime best practices.</p>

"7884959","1","","<p>I'm using Python 2.6 and PyGTK 2.22.6 from the <a href=""http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/"" rel=""noreferrer"">all-in-one installer</a> on Windows XP, trying to build a single-file executable (via <a href=""http://www.py2exe.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">py2exe</a>) for my app.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I run my app as a script (ie. not built into an <code>.exe</code> file, just as a loose collection of <code>.py</code> files), it uses the native-looking Windows theme, but when I run the built exe I see the default GTK theme.</p>

<p>I know that this problem can be fixed by copying a bunch of files into the <code>dist</code> directory created by py2exe, but everything I've read involves manually copying the data, whereas I want this to be an automatic part of the build process. Furthermore, everything on the topic (including <a href=""http://faq.pygtk.org/index.py?req=show&amp;file=faq21.005.htp"" rel=""noreferrer"">the FAQ</a>) is out of date - PyGTK now keeps its files in <code>C:\Python2x\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime\...</code>, and just copying the <code>lib</code> and <code>etc</code> directories doesn't fix the problem.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I'd like to be able to programmatically find the GTK runtime data in <code>setup.py</code> rather than hard coding paths. How do I do this?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the minimal resources I need to include?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I may have almost answered #2 by trial-and-error. For the ""wimp"" (ie. MS Windows) theme to work, I need the files from:</p>

<pre><code>runtime\lib\gtk-2.0\2.10.0\engines\libwimp.dll
runtime\etc\gtk-2.0\gtkrc
runtime\share\icons\*
runtime\share\themes\MS-Windows
</code></pre>

<p>...without the <code>runtime</code> prefix, but otherwise with the same directory structure, sitting directly in the <code>dist</code> directory produced by py2exe. But where does the <code>2.10.0</code> come from, given that <code>gtk.gtk_version</code> is <code>(2,22,0)</code>?</p>

<p>when I flush the cache everything proceeds as normal until memcache needs to be read again...</p>

<p>The hit ratio and memcache size increases as normal, so there is something in the cache. Also when I revert back to app engine 1.7.5 everything works just fine. Perhaps someone else has had this issue?</p>
