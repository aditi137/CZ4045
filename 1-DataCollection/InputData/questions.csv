Using python 3.4.2 and django 1.8.
Trying to display a list of products and encountered an error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Exception Type:  TemplateSyntaxError </p>
  
  <p>Exception Value:   Invalid block tag: 'endfor'</p>
  
  <p>Exception Location: myvirtualenv/lib/python3.4/site-packages/django/template/base.py in

</blockquote>

<p>Can't figure out what's wrong. Found few related questions on stackoverflow but they did't help.</p>

<p>Give me a hint, please. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Views:</p>

<pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Product

def list_items(request):
    products = Product.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'catalog/list_item.html', {'products': products})

<p>list_item.html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        {% block title %}some title{% endblock %}
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
            {% for product in products %)
            {{ product }}
            {% endfor %}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

<p>P.S Without   content, {% block title %} renders with no errors.</p>

"31247460","1","","<p>I've been trying to find a way to make Seaborn and Vincent interactive so that I can, for example, zoom in/out in a specific area of the plot in real time. Is this possible to do? Alternatively, are there other recommended libraries (that are not cloud-based services) that work well for visualizing time series data?</p>

"13941","1","","<p>I'd like to have a python program alert me when it has completed its task by making a beep noise.  Currently,  I use <code>import os</code> and then use a command line speech program to say ""Process complete.""  I much rather it be a simple ""bell.""</p>

<p>I know that there's a function that can be used in Cocoa apps, NSBeep, but I don't think that has much anything to do with this.</p>

<p>I've also tried <code>print(\a)</code> but that didn't work.</p>

<p>I'm using a Mac, if you couldn't tell by my Cocoa comment, so that may help.</p>

"15678988","1","","<p>So I have the following case:</p>

<p>I have a module that has several function definitions. I want to create a class that has those functions available to it.</p>

<p>I just wanted to ask which way is best?
Option1</p>

<pre><code>import ModuleWithFunctions

class bla(object):

    ModuleWithFunctions = ModuleWithFunctions
</code></pre>

<p>Option2</p>

<pre><code>class bla(object):

    import ModuleWithFunctions

<p>I know option 2 is against PEP 8 so I assume people will say option1, however, what if I wanted everything to be available as:</p>

<pre><code>bla.(function) 
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>bla.ModuleWithFunctions.(function)

<pre><code>splitsOfPath1 = [(0,3), (3,1)]
splitsOfPath2 = [(0,3), (3, 2), (2, 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>How can this be achieved? the way I read paths is to go from 0 to 1, you need to visit 3. But to break that down, to go from 0 to 1. You need to go from 0 to 3 (0,3) and then from 3 to 1 (3, 1)</p>

"15679272","1","","<p>By ""reasonable"" environment I mean that it should not require the user to manually install any dependencies of the application, but a working Python installation can be required. Additionally I would like the application to work on Windows, OSX, and popular Linux distributions. If I can package a Python interpreter as well, that's better. Size is not really a concern. A good example of what I want to accomplish is the SublimeText editor. </p>

<p>Is there an established way of doing this?</p>

"23507408","1","","<p>So since last week suddenly <code>git push origin master</code> doesn't work anymore to ""push to deploy"". It sure pushes the sources to remote repository at Google, and the code is there but it never deploys. Read about it here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23400892/gae-trouble-with-push-to-deploy"">GAE: Trouble with push to deploy</a></p>

<p>It seems things are changing over at Google and this week there is new stuff in the Google Developer Console, in the ""Cloud Development/Releases"" section; ""Configure Release Pipeline""</p>

<p>There are three settings: the pipeline name, pipeline tasks, and then an optional setting to have deploy notifications sent by email.</p>

<p>I just enter a random name like ""mydevpipeline"", select ""Deploy source only"", and check the email box. But I just get this error: ""Failed to create the pipeline."". I also tried unchecking the email box, still same error. Tried it over and over.</p>

<p>No where to go from there...
Anyone been able to create this pipeline and get it all working?</p>

<p>It seems that this pipeline configuration must go through in order for push to deploy from now. I haven't seen any news or notification about this change...</p>

<p>Fwiw, the documentation <a href=""https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/push-to-deploy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/push-to-deploy</a> states nothing about pipelines. It's just outdated I guess.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>What do you know... I went on trying to configure this pipeline on the live GAE project (the one described above is the dev GAE project I'm using)... and it worked. I could configure a pipeline ok. After that, I could once more push-to-deploy, alas only on the <em>live</em> version so far. I might try creating a new dev project, it seems existing projects ""break"" from time to time... I have had similar problems before and creating a new project DOES solve things from time to time.....</p>

"15679359","1","","<p>I'm currently working my way through the excellent Python Challenge (<a href=""http://www.pythonchallenge.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pythonchallenge.com/</a>). The current problem I'm tackling involves the use of the urllib library but I'm having issues.  I'm attempting to use this library to connect to the site through my company's firewall.  Let's start with some code:</p>

<pre><code>proxy = {'http':'http://my.companys.proxy/proxy.pac'}
urllib.urlopen('http://www.pythonchallenge.com', proxies=proxy).read()
</code></pre>

<p>This yields an http response, but strangely its the Apache HTTP server test page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Red Hat Enterprise Linux <strong>Test Page</strong>... This page is used to test the proper operation of the Apache HTTP server after it has been installed, etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I appear to be successfully acheiving an http connection outside our firewall but getting a different http resposne than my browser.  Another clue (or not) is when I try to connect to the about.php page:</p>

<pre><code>urllib.urlopen('http://www.pythonchallenge.com/about.php', proxies=proxy).read()
</code></pre>

<p>This, however, yields:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>404 Not found... Apache 2.2.3 Red Hat Server at www.pythonchallenge.com Port 80</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both addresses above work just fine in my browser (using the same proxy).  Any ideas where I'm going wrong?</p>

"38963698","1","","<p>I have a Flask web-server which generates server-sent-events (sse) which should be received by all connected web-clients.</p>

<p>In ""<strong>Version 1</strong>"" below this works. All web-clients receive the events, and update accordingly.</p>

<p>In ""<strong>Version 2</strong>"" below, which is a refactoring of Version 1, this no longer works as expected:</p>

<p>Instead I get:</p>

<ul>
<li>mostly only one of the web-clients gets the event, or </li>
<li>rarely
multiple web-clients get the event, or </li>
<li>rarely none of the
web-clients get the event</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I can make out, the server is always generating the events, and normally at least one client is receiving.</p>

<p>My initial test hosted the web-server on a Raspberry Pi 3, with the web-clients on the Pi, on Windows and OSX using a variety of browsers.</p>

<p>To eliminate any possible network issues I repeated the same test with the web-server and 3 instances of Chrome all hosted on the same OSX laptop.
This gave the same results: Version 1 ""OK"", Version 2 ""NOT OK"".</p>

<p>The client that successfully receives seemingly varies randomly from event to event: so far I can't discern a pattern.</p>

<p>Both Version 1 and Version 2 have a structure <code>change_objects</code> containing ""things that should be tracked for changes""</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In Version 1 <code>change_objects</code> is a dict of dicts.</p></li>
<li><p>In Version 2 I refactored <code>change_objects</code> to be a list of instances of the class <code>Reporter</code>, or sub classes of <code>Reporter</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The changes to the ""things"" are triggered based on web-services received elsewhere in the code.</p>

"31247647","1","","<p>I am quite new to Python, so please excuse if this is a stupid beginner's error. However I am struggling with it for quite some time.
I want to create a figure with n x m subplots, each subplot being np.array of shape [1024,264,264]. As I am looking for differences occuring in the stack along the 0-dimension I want to use a slider to explore all stacks in my figure simultaneously. 
The slider instance works nicely for a figure with one subplot but I can't bring them all to work.
That's the code I am using:</p>

#Define the xy size of the mapped array
xsize=3
ysize=3

lengthh5=9
readlist=[]

    npraw=np.random.rand(200,50,50)
    readlist.append (npraw)

    l = ax.imshow(readlist[k][frame,:,:]) 
    plt.axis('off')
           sframe = Slider(fig.add_subplot(50,1,50), 'Frame', 0, len(readlist[0])-1, valinit=0)
    def update(val):
        frame = np.around(sframe.val)
        l.set_data(readlist[k][frame,:,:])


sframe.on_changed(update)

plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>For this particular case I stripped it down to a 3x3 array for my figure and just create randmom (smaller) arrays.
The slider is interestinly only operable on the second last subplot. However I have no real idea how to link it to all subplots simulatenously. Perhaps someone has an idea how to do this.
Thanks a lot in advance,</p>

"8121142","1","","<p>I am trying to create a web interface for searching through a large number of huge configuration files (approx 60000 files, each one with a size between 20 KByte to 50 MByte). Those files are also updated frequently (~3 times/day).</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>Must identify the line numbers for each matching line</li>
<li>Good update performance</li>
</ul>

<p>What I have looked into:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lucene</strong>: To identify a line number, each line must be stored in a separate Lucene document, each containing two fields (the line number and the line). This makes updates hard/slow.</li>
<li><strong>SOLR</strong> and <strong>Sphinx</strong>: Both based on Lucene, they have the same problem and do not allow for identifying the line number.</li>
<li><strong>SQL table with a fulltext index</strong>: Again, no way to show the line number.</li>
<li><strong>SQL table with each line in a separate row</strong>: Tested this with SQLite or MySQL, and update performance was the worst of all options. Updating a 50 MB document took more than an hour.</li>
<li><strong>eXist-db</strong>: We converted each text file to XML like this: <code>&lt;xml&gt;&lt;line number=""1""&gt;test&lt;/line&gt;...&lt;/xml&gt;</code>. Updates take ~5 minutes, which somewhat works but we are still not happy with it.</li>
<li><strong>Whoosh</strong> for Python: Pretty much like Lucene. I have implemented a prototype that sort-of works by dropping/re-importing all lines of a given file. Updating a 50MB document takes about 2-3 minutes using this method.</li>
<li><strong>GNU id utils</strong>: Suggested by sarnold, this is blazingly fast (50MB document is updated in less then 10 seconds on my test machine) and would be perfect if it had pagination and an API.</li>

"32491545","1","","<p>Im trying to call a python file containing a sentence/word tokenizer from my php file like this:</p>

<pre><code>$output = shell_exec('python tokenizer.py $sentence')
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried single <code>exec</code>, full paths to python and tokenizer.py, wrapping <code>$sentence</code> in double quotes. But logically, It should not be the problem because calling <code>print(1)</code> at the beginning of python the python code <strong>before actually using any nltk packages</strong> makes <code>$output</code> equal to '1'. So I came to conclusion that the problem here is the nltk itself, like the path to the modules is not correct or something...</p>

<p>But, calling python from the shell using the same command as above gives me fully tokenized output! <strong>To conclude: looks like when calling python from php magically 'turns off' nltk, while it fully works when executed from the shell.</strong></p>

<p>Here's the part of the python code I am using:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

sample_text2 = sys.argv[1]
gust = sent_tokenize(sample_text2)
#print(1) here doesn't work, but everywhere above (before calling sent_tokenize) it does.
</code></pre>

<p>The server's running on CentOS (Linux), I am accessing it via SSH.</p>

<p><strong>Obvious question: What am I doing wrong here with PHP? Or generally? Any alternatives?</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
As visible in dvhh's answer and its comments, the situation happened because there were two versions installed on the server (2.6 and 2.7), while the <code>www</code> user had access to 2.6 and through console, the default version was 2.7. The solution was to change the default python to 2.7 for both cases and to put the nltk modules to one of the dependency folders. (Or append the dependency directory using sys.path.append)</p>

<pre><code>src/
--scripts/
----foo/a.py
----bar/b.py
--lib1
--lib2
--lib3
</code></pre>

<p>The intent if to have scripts/foo/ and scripts/bar/ be directories of runnable python scripts that make use of the modules in lib1, lib2, lib3. Scripts, lib1, lib2, and lib3 are all separate internal git repositories under active development. There isn't a static interface or published version to depend on. Basically, they are all being written nearly at the same time by a small team.</p>

<p>I've played with making lib[1-3] submodules and I really hate the workflow. What I think I would like is to be able to do ""import lib1"" from foo/a.py and have it use the current code in lib1. Once things mature we will likely version everything and work to product proper packages. </p>

<p>One way to do this would to muck with <code>sys.path</code> in each of the scripts to explicitly look in '../../' or something. I was wondering if there was something more elegant. Could I get something like <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to do this work for me? I don't want to make an official pypi setup.py, I just want to get a pointer to the current contents of the lib[1-3] directory. The reason I like the requirements.txt approach is that as the libs mature, I'll end up putting version and git URLs in there. </p>

<p>Or, is there a completely different way to do this?</p>

I am trying to build a small program in 2.7 which generates a prime number, asks the user to continue or not, and then continues generating primes until the user tells it to stop.

            prime = True
    if prime == True:

  tasks:
  - name: ""Test Playboook Functionality""

  - name: ""Include json user output""
    set_fact: passwords=""{{pass.stdout | from_json}}""

  - debug: "" {{passwords.cdc.cdc_test_server.cdc_test_user.password}} ""
</code></pre>

<p>The first debug generates the correct json output, but i am not able to include the variables in ansible, so that I can use them via jinja2 notation. set_fact doesn't throw an exception, but the last debug just returns a ""Hello world"" - message? So my question is: How do I properly include the json key value pairs as ansible variables via task?</p>

"23500173","1","","<p>I'm interested in comparing CPU times some code portions written C++ vs Python (running on Linux). Will the following methods produce a ""fair"" comparison between the two? </p>

<h1>Python</h1>

<p>Using the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/resource.html"" rel=""nofollow"">resource module</a>:</p>

<pre><code>import resource
def cpu_time():
    return resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF)[0]+\ # time in user mode
        resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF)[1] # time in system mode
</code></pre>

<p>which allows for timing like so:</p>

<pre><code>def timefunc( func ):
    start=cpu_time()
    func()
    return (cpu_time()-start)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I test like:</p>

<pre><code>def f():
    for i in range(int(1e6)):
        pass

avg = 0
for k in range(10):
    avg += timefunc( f ) / 10.0
print avg
=&gt; 0.002199700000000071
</code></pre>

<h1>C++</h1>

<p>Using the <code>ctime</code> lib:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    double avg = 0.0;
    int N = (int) 1e6;
    for (int k=0; k&lt;10; k++) {
        clock_t start;
        start = clock();
        for (int i=0; i&lt;N; i++) continue;
        avg += (double)(clock()-start) / 10.0 / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    }
    std::cout &lt;&lt; avg &lt;&lt; '\n';
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>which yields <code>0.002</code>.</p>

<p>Concerns:</p>

<ol>
<li>I've read that C++ <code>clock()</code> measures CPU time which is what I'm after, but I can't seem to find if it includes both user and system times.</li>
<li>Results from C++ are much less precise. Why is that?</li>
<li>Overall fairness of comparison as mentioned.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>updated the c++ code as per David's suggestion in the comments:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/resource.h&gt;

int main() {
    double avg = 0.0;

    sstart = usage.ru_stime;

    for (int k=0; k&lt;10; k++) {
        ustart = usage.ru_utime;

        ustop = usage.ru_utime;
        sstop = usage.ru_stime;

        avg += (
            (ustop.tv_sec+ustop.tv_usec/1e6+
            sstop.tv_sec+sstop.tv_usec/1e6)

    return 0;

<p>For instance, say we define a circle in 2D with 11 points in the figure below. I would like to add points in between each consecutive pair of points in order or produce a smooth trace.

"5966","1","","<p>Basically, I've written an API to www.thetvdb.com in Python. The current code can be found <a href=""http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api/tree/master/tvdb_api.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>It grabs data from the API as requested, and has to store the data somehow, and make it available by doing:</p>

<pre><code>print tvdbinstance[1][23]['episodename'] # get the name of episode 23 of season 1
</code></pre>

<p>What is the ""best"" way to abstract this data within the <code>Tvdb()</code> class?</p>

<p>I originally used a extended <code>Dict()</code> that automatically created sub-dicts (so you could do <code>x[1][2][3][4] = ""something""</code> without having to do <code>if x[1].has_key(2): x[1][2] = []</code> and so on)</p>

<p>Then I just stored the data by doing <code>self.data[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name] = ""something""</code></p>

<p>This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if <code>x[3][24]</code> was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception).</p>

<p>Currently it's using four classes: <code>ShowContainer</code>, <code>Show</code>, <code>Season</code> and <code>Episode</code>. Each one is a very basic dict, which I can easily add extra functionality in (the <code>search()</code> function on <code>Show()</code> for example). Each has a <code>__setitem__</code>, <code>__getitem_</code> and <code>has_key</code>.</p>

<p>This works mostly fine, I can check in Shows if it has that season in it's <code>self.data</code> dict, if not, <code>raise season_not_found</code>. I can also check in <code>Season()</code> if it has that episode and so on.</p>

<p>The problem now is it's presenting itself as a dict, but doesn't have all the functionality, and because I'm overriding the <code>__getitem__</code> and <code>__setitem__</code> functions, it's easy to accidentally recursively call <code>__getitem__</code> (so I'm not sure if extending the <code>Dict</code> class will cause problems).</p>

<p>The other slight problem is adding data into the dict is a lot more work than the old <code>Dict</code> method (which was <code>self.data[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute'] = 'something'</code>). See <code>_setItem</code> and <code>_setData</code>. It's not too bad, since it's currently only a read-only API interface (so the users of the API should only ever retrieve data, not add more), but it's hardly... Elegant.</p>

<p>I think the series-of-classes system is probably the best way, but does anyone have a better idea for storing the data? And would extending the <code>ShowContainer</code>/etc classes with <code>Dict</code> cause problems?</p>

<p>The following code is taken from <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#property"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python Docs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class Parrot(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._voltage = 100000

    @property
    def voltage(self):
        """"""Get the current voltage.""""""
        return self._voltage
</code></pre>

<p>When I run:</p>

<pre><code>parrot = Parrot()
print(parrot.voltage)
parrot.voltage = 100
print(parrot.voltage)
</code></pre>

<p>I get the following output (as expected, as no <em>setter</em> is defined)</p>

<pre><code>{0: 100000}
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File ""prop.py"", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;
     parrot.voltage = 100
 AttributeError: can't set attribute
</code></pre>

<h3>@property defined as <code>dict</code></h3>

<p>However, if I define <code>self._voltage = {}</code> the <strong>property becomes writeable</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>class Parrot(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._voltage = {}
        self._voltage[0] = 100000

    @property
    def voltage(self):
        """"""Get the current voltage.""""""
        return self._voltage

parrot = Parrot()
print(parrot.voltage)
parrot.voltage[0] = 100
print(parrot.voltage)
</code></pre>

<p>The output is then:</p>

<pre><code>{0: 100000}
{0: 100}
</code></pre>

<p>Same behavior in Python 2.7.9 and Python 3.4.3. Why is the property writeable, even if no <em>setter</em> is explicitly defined in the code? <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3137685/using-pythons-property-decorator-on-dicts"">Here</a> it was proposed to subclass <code>dict</code> to get this behavior. However, it seems that this not required.</p>

"31243052","1","","<p>Yesterday, I encountered a problem which requires calculating combinations in an iterable with range 5.</p>

<p>Instead of using <code>itertools.combination</code>, I tried to make a primitive function of my own. It looks like:</p>

<pre><code>def combine_5(elements):
    """"""Find all combinations in elements with range 5.""""""
    temp_list = []
    for i in elements:
        cur_index = elements.index(i)
        for j in elements[cur_index+1 : ]:
            cur_index = elements.index(j)
            for k in elements[cur_index+1 : ]:
                cur_index = elements.index(k)
                for n in elements[cur_index+1 : ]:
                    cur_index = elements.index(n)
                    for m in elements[cur_index+1 : ]:
                        temp_list.append((i,j,k,n,m))

    return temp_list
</code></pre>

<p>Then I thought maybe I can abstract it a bit, to make a <code>combine_n</code> function. And below is my initial blueprint:</p>

<pre><code># Unfinished version of combine_n
def combine_n(elements, r, cur_index=-1):
    """"""Find all combinations in elements with range n""""""
    r -= 1 
    target_list = elements[cur_index+1 : ]
    for i in target_list:
        cur_index = elements.index(i)
        if r &gt; 0:
            combine_n(elements, r, cur_index)
            pass
        else:
            pass
</code></pre>

<p>Then I've been stuck there for a whole day, the major problem is that I can't convey a value properly inside the recursive function. I added some code that fixed one problem. But as it works for every recursive loop, new problems arose.  More fixes lead to more bugs, a vicious cycle.</p>

<p>And then I went for help to <code>itertools.combination</code>'s source code. And it turns out it didn't use recursion technique.   </p>

<p>Do you think it is possible to abstract this <code>combine_5</code> function into a <code>combine_n</code> function with recursion technique? Do you have any ideas about its realization?</p>

  <p>This is my recent try after a bunch of overcomplicated experiments.<br>

  But the problem is, in a nested for loop, when the lower for-loop hit with an empty list.<br>
  The <code>temp_list.append((i,j,k,n,m))</code> clause of <code>combine_5</code> will not work.<br>
  But in <code>FAILURE SAMPLE 1</code>, it still will print the content of the upper for-loop<br>

<p>I was wondering if it would be faster to read things in chunks of ~4MB with one thread, put them in a bounded buffer, have a different thread for conversion to string format, and have a final thread write the string back into a file on a different harddisk. I might be jumping the gun though...</p>

<p>I'm using python right now for testing, but I wouldn't be opposed to switching if I can work through these files faster.</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be great. Thanks</p>

<p>Currently I have 2 classes (Game and Labyrinth). The Labyrinth class is responsible for reading and writing the file.</p>

<p>My question is, is it ok to open the file in the <strong>init</strong> function of Labyrinth and close it at the end of the game within another function (which can be called from another class)? Or is it better to open and close the file every time?</p>

<p>The reason I don't save the file content into a string with <code>readlines()</code> is because I'm supposed to save to the file each step of the game.</p>

<p>As you can see, the <strong>code is very long and repetitive</strong>, even the shortened form. Running it on my laptop <strong>takes almost a minute</strong> (and my laptop is new). I have searched for answers, but I only found ways to generate random numbers. I tried using <em>itertools.permutations</em> as well, but that only shows the permutations, not creating a number. </p>

<p>Generating all ten digits takes too long, and I want to know if there is a <strong><em>faster, simpler way, with an explanation, using python 3.</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Compute 2^x where x is the user input. x should be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 25. If the user input is not an integer then raise an exception. Create custom exceptions and raise if x is less than 5 and greater than 25. Then add the digits of 2x. For example if user inputs 6, then find 26 = 64, so the sum of the digits is 6 + 4 = 10.</strong></p>

<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DukV8.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/DukV8.png"" alt=""still enters if branch""></a>  </p>

<p>item_info is blank, I think it should go to else branch, however, it entered if branch, any help is greatly appreciated!  </p>

<p>Edit after elethan's answer:
I've printed it out to debug, here's the screenshot:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9Slh.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9Slh.png"" alt=""2nd_img""></a>
So, looks like this item_info is really empty, I didn't see any item_info object gets printed out.</p>

<p>Also, to help debug, here's my view code:</p>

<pre><code>def item_info(request):    
    iteminfo= ItemInfo.objects.all().filter(Q(some_query)
    table = ItemInfoTable(iteminfo)
    RequestConfig(request).configure(table)
    return render(request, 'item_info.html', {'item_info':table,})

    itmno = tables.Column(verbose_name=""Item #"")
    class Meta:
        model = ItemInfo
        empty_text = ""There is no item record.""

"15679719","1","","<p>Let's suppose I have a set of 2D coordinates that represent the centers of cells of a 2D regular mesh. I would like to find, for each cell in the grid, the two closest neighbors in each direction.</p>

<p>The problem is quite straightforward if one assigns to each cell and index defined as follows:</p>

<p>idx_cell = idx+N*idy</p>

<p>where N is the total number of cells in the grid, idx=x/dx and idy=y/dx, with x and y being the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of a cell and dx its size.</p>

<p>For example, the neighboring cells for a cell with idx_cell=5 are the cells with idx_cell equal to 4,6 (for the x-axis) and 5+N,5-N (for the y-axis).</p>

<p>The problem that I have is that my implementation of the algorithm is quite slow for large (N>1e6) data sets.</p>

<p>For instance, to get the neighbors of the x-axis I do</p>

<p><code>[x[(idx_cell==idx_cell[i]-1)|(idx_cell==idx_cell[i]+1)] for i in cells]</code></p>

<p>Do you think there's a fastest way to implement this algorithm?</p>

Here is a dialog's screenshot a code posted below results.
I avoid using any widgets outside of QListWidgets(). Ideal solution would be solved utilizing QListWidgets itself. It would be great if there is a way to place a text line-label similar to those available for QGroupBox with .setTitle('myString'). At very least an ability to place a label as a first list item would be sufficient too... </p>

"31248615","1","","<p>I was trying to use ZMQ - PUSH - PULL to build a distributed task processing system. This was east to do using JMS in Java with a Queue and a listener;Listeners which are free could take the message of the queue and execute it.Once the queue is distributed across nodes, this acts like a load balancer.</p>

<p>With ZMQ (using Python - don't want to use Celery now), I was trying out PUSH and PULL. With the Worker having different processing time. However even when a worker is free, tasks are going in strictly  round robin fashion. That is irrespective of if a worker is free or not, the task goes  in a round robin way.</p>

<p>Is there any way of simulating a distributed queue with ZMQ patterns so that, I can have a pool of workers 'polling' the queue in each node and which ever is free pulls the message from the queue and process it.</p>

"31251807","1","","<p>Recently I have been having trouble opening specific UTF-16 encoded files in Python. I have tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>import codecs
f = codecs.open('filename.data', 'r', 'utf-16-be')
contents = f.read()
</code></pre>

<p>but I get the following error:</p>

<pre><code>UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf16' codec can't decode bytes in position 18-19: illegal UTF-16 surrogate
</code></pre>

<p>after trying to read the contents of the file. I have tried forcing little-endian as well, but that's no good. The file header is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>0x FE FF EE FF
</code></pre>

<p>Which I have read denotes UTF-16 Big Endian. I have been able to read the contents of the file into a raw string by using the following:</p>

<pre><code>f = open('filename.data', 'rb')
raw = f.read()
hex = binascii.hexlify(raw)
</code></pre>

<p>Which works for getting me the raw hex, but the thing is - sometimes these files will be little-endian, sometimes they will be big-endian so I essentially just want to normalize the data before I start parsing, which I was hoping codecs would be able to help me out with, but no luck..</p>

<p>Does anyone have an idea of what's going on here? I would provide the file(s) as reference but there is some sensitive data so unfortunately I can't. This file is used by Windows OS.</p>

<p>My end goal, as I mentioned above, is to be able to open/read these files and normalize them so that I can use the same parser for all of them, rather than having to write a few parsers with a bunch of error handling in case the encoding is wacky.</p>

<p>Now, suppose I want to get the number of awards for all users and the number of awards used for all users (ie, a queryset containing both). I prefer to do it one query for each calculation - when I combined it in my code I had some unexpected results. Also for some of my queries it won't be possible to do it one query, since the query will get too complex - I'm calculating 8 fields. This is how I solved it so far:</p>

<pre><code>def get_summary(query_date)

    award_used_dict = {}
    for award in awards_used:
        award_used_dict[award] = award.used

    for award in summary:
        award.used = award_used_dict.get(award, 0)

    return summary

<p>I'm sure there must be a way to solve this without the dictionary approach? For instance, something like this: <code>awards_used.get(award=award)</code>, but this causes a db lookup every loop.</p>

<p>Or some other fancy way to join the querysets?</p>

"7838241","1","","<p>I'm building a PyGTK application with several widgets that when changed, need to <strong>notify other widgets about the change</strong>. I would like to avoid code like this:</p>

<pre><code>def on_entry_color_updated(self, widget):
    self.paint_tools_panel.current_color_pane.update_color()
    self.main_window.status_bar.update_color()
    self.current_tool.get_brush().update_color()
</code></pre>

<p>And do something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>def on_entry_color_updated(self, widget):
    self.update_notify('color-changed')
</code></pre>

<p>The status bar, current color pane and current tool would subscribe to that notification event and act accordingly. From what I can tell, the GObject signaling mechanism only allows me to register a callback on a particular widget, so each object that wants to receive a notification has to be aware of that widget.</p>

<p><strong>Does GTK provide such a system or should I build it myself?</strong> Developers of Shotwell, a photo organization application for GNOME, had to build their own signaling mechanism, if I understand their <a href=""http://redmine.yorba.org/projects/shotwell/wiki/ShotwellArchDataStructures"" rel=""nofollow"">design doc</a> correctly. Searching here on SO didn't turn out any definitive answers.</p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p>Clarification why I think GObject signaling is not what I need (or just a part of what I need). With GObject, I need to explicitly connect an object to another object, like so:</p>

<pre><code>emitter.connect('custom-event', receiver.event_handler)
</code></pre>

<p>So in my application, I would have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>class ColorPane(gtk.Something):
    def __init__(self, application):
        # init stuff goes here...

        application.color_pallette.connect('color-changed', self.update_color)

    def update_color(self, widget):
        """"""Show the new color.""""""
        pass

class StatusBar(gtk.Something):
    def __init__(self, application):
        # init stuff goes here...

        application.color_pallette.connect('color-changed', self.update_color)

    def update_color(self, widget):
        """"""Show the new color name.""""""
        pass

class Brush(gtk.Something):
    def __init__(self, application):
        # init stuff goes here...

        application.color_pallette.connect('color-changed', self.update_color)

    def update_color(self, widget):
        """"""Draw with new color.""""""
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, I have to pass the application object or some other object that knows about the color_pallete to other objects in my application so that they connect to color_pallette signals. This is the kind of coupling that I want to avoid.</p>

"7838401","1","","<p>I'm using a python tool called ""Ajaxterm""(http://wiki.kartbuilding.net/index.php/Ajaxterm). After setting it up. The problem  , I face is,when type few chars - they appear as jumbled character.For example,When i type ""abcde"" it may come as ""cdbea"" - but no character missing.   From my understanding - I tried to debug the python code,it seems like ajaxterm internal server (qweb - QWebRequest Request Handler) processes the request it.There seems to be nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>The problem is (I assume) - From .js file (javascript) to ajaxterm.py , for every character i type a connect() is initiated and thus  characters typed later may be arriving sooner than the previously typed character. </p>

<p>How should I make sure,character appear in the order it was typed. </p>

"31412","1","","<p>I am developing a GPL-licensed application in Python and need to know if the GPL allows my program to use proprietary plug-ins. This is <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">what the FSF has to say</a> on the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>If a program released under the GPL uses plug-ins, what are the requirements for the licenses of a plug-in?</strong></p>
  
  <p>It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements for them.</p>
  
  <p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.</p>
  
  <p>If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, besides being kind of artificial, doesn't carry over to interpreted languages: what about a Python/Perl/Ruby plugin, which gets loaded via <code>import</code> or <code>execfile</code>?</p>

<p>(edit: I understand why the distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, but it seems like someone who wanted to comply with the GPL but go against the ""spirit"" --I don't-- could just use fork/exec and interprocess communication to do pretty much anything).</p>

<p>The best solution would be to add an exception to my license to explicitly allow the use of proprietary plugins, but I am unable to do so since I'm using <a href=""http://trolltech.com/products/qt"" rel=""noreferrer"">Qt</a>/<a href=""http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro"" rel=""noreferrer"">PyQt</a> which is GPL.</p>

"7838606","1","","<p>Edit 3: I replaced <code>__file__</code> with <code>sys.argv[0]</code>, when I need to know the location of my script/executable. This is not exactly the same, but in my case it seems to run fine (at least on executable version...). Now everything is working fine, in one-file mode, with use of accepted answer's function to access resource files!</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit 2: as shown in accepted answer's comments, problem is coming from path resolution in my script; I try to use <code>__file__</code> to get the location of the script, so that I can access to its resource files. This does not work once packaged, as <code>__file__</code> will return filename from <code>Python.dll</code> to the script, so quite always no path and just a file name. So I have to find another trick to make access to resource files; a work-around for the moment is to move current directory to the executable path.</p>

<p>By the way, this means that the ConfigParser should report problem when accessing the file, and not that a section is missing.</p>

<p>These two versions of code basically do the same task, however, the version 1 code will use more than 800ms to perform a simple put operation (a yellow or red light) CPU time on google app engine. In the contract, the version 2 code only use about 300ms. (Both test on HRD datastore) </p>

<p>On M/S Datastore, the version 1 code will use about 400ms and version 2 code will use about 150ms.</p>

<p>I can image that the version 1 will be slower compare to version 2, since it use more key index.  However, it is hard to believe that the difference is so huge. It is also surprising that Google app engine cannot handle such a easy task. </p>

<p>Does that mean we cannot expect GAE to perform insert on data with more than 10 properties
or do I misunderstand anything?</p>

"31256174","1","","<p>I installed django-lazysignup and am facing the challenge now of User.is_authenticated() returning True, for what are not <em>actually</em> authenticated users, but instead lazy-signup users.  I can update any checks for User.is_authenticated() in my code with my own function.  However, other packages like django-allauth, check this method to decide whether a user is already signed-in, and redirect from attempts to reach the login page.</p>

<pre><code>class RedirectAuthenticatedUserMixin(object):
    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        self.request = request
        if request.user.is_authenticated():
            redirect_to = self.get_authenticated_redirect_url()
            response = HttpResponseRedirect(redirect_to)
            return _ajax_response(request, response)
...
</code></pre>

<p>Are there any recommendations that don't require replacing is_authenticated() in every package that I include?  Seems most of them expect it to function a particular way, and django-lazysignup turns that on its head.  Could I monkey patch the User model with a new is_authenticated() method?  If it's possible, where would I do this so that it's attached to the page request?</p>

I have read several SO questions and multiprocessing lib documentation, and this very helpful <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1SkCYMnfbY"" rel=""nofollow"">video</a> and still cannot figure it out. 
I want the program to fork into several threads when it reaches this loop, run in parallel and then after all processes have finished it should continue the program on single process from the line after the loop section. 
func_A received the dictionary value and key from dic, calculates some simple operations, and updates the anotherDic data. This is an independent process, as long as all the same i[0] keys are handles by same process. So, I cannot use pool map function which automatically divides the data between cores. I am going to sort the keys by the first element of key tuple, and then divide them manually between the threads. </p>

<p>How can i pass/share the very big dictionary (dic) between the processes? Different process will read and write to different keys (i.e. keys that each process deals with are different from the rest of processes)
If I cannot find answer to this, I will just use smaller temporary dic for each process, and in the end just join the dics.</p>

<p>Then question is, how I can force process to fork and go muliprocessor just for the loop section, and after the loop all the processes join before continuing with rest of the code on a single thread?</p>

I was testing update on 3 nodes, and the time on one of those nodes was 1 second behind, so when update a row, the write time is always behind the timestamp, cassandra would not update the rows. I sync all nodes time, and the issue fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I double checked the result, all insertions are succeed, partial updates failed. There's no error/exception messages</p>

<p>I have a cassandra cluster(Cassandra 2.0.13) which contains 5 nodes. Using <code>python(2.6.6) cassandra driver(2.6.0c2)</code> for inserting data into database.  my server systems are Centos6.X</p>

"31256286","1","","<p>I have a complex document that I am trying to structure most conveniently and efficiently with JSON in Python.  I would like to be able to retrieve one of the items in my document with one line (i.e. not via a <code>for</code> loop)</p>

<p>A demo of the structure looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""movies"": {
        ""0"": {
            ""name"": ""charles"",
            ""id"": 0,

            ""id"": 1, 
            ""loopable"": true
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I am trying to be able to easily fetch a movie based on its <code>id</code> field.  To do this, right now, I have made the <code>index</code> the same as the key to the movies object.   So when I <code>json.load</code> the object to find movie <code>1</code>'s name I can just do <code>movie[(id)]['name']</code></p>

<p>It seems like I should have a <code>list</code> of movies in the json file but it also seems like that would be more complicated. It could look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
    ""movies"": [
        {
            ""name"": ""charles"",
            ""id"": 0, 
            ""loopable"": true
        },
        {
            ""name"": ""ray"",
            ""id"": 1, 
            ""loopable"": true
        }
    ]
} 
</code></pre>

<p>but if that were the case I would have to loop through the entire array like this:</p>

<pre><code>for movie in movies:
    if movie['id'] == (id)
        # Now I can get movie['id']['name']

"15689237","1","","<p>I'm curious about the benefits and tradeoffs of using numpy <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">ufuncs</a> vs. the built-in operators vs. the 'function' versions of the built-in operators.</p>

<p>I'm curious about all ufuncs.  Maybe there are times when some are more useful than others.  However, I'll use <code>&lt;</code> for my examples just for simplicity.</p>

<p>There are several ways to 'filter' a numpy array by a single number to get a boolean array.  Each form gives the same results, but is there a preferred time/place to use one over the other?  This example I'm comparing an array against a single number, so all 3 will work.</p>

<p>Consider all examples using the following array:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = numpy.arange(0, 10000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
array([   0,    1,    2, ..., 9997, 9998, 9999])
</code></pre>

<h2>'&lt;' operator</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x &lt; 5000
array([ True,  True,  True, ..., False, False, False], dtype=bool)
&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit x &lt; 5000
100000 loops, best of 3: 15.3 us per loop
</code></pre>

<h2>operator.lt</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import operator
&gt;&gt;&gt; operator.lt(x, 5000)
array([ True,  True,  True, ..., False, False, False], dtype=bool)
&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit operator.lt(x, 5000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 15.3 us per loop
</code></pre>

<h2>numpy.less</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.less(x, 5000)
array([ True,  True,  True, ..., False, False, False], dtype=bool)
&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit numpy.less(x, 5000)
100000 loops, best of 3: 15 us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Note that all of them achieve pretty much the equivalent performance and exactly the same results.  I'm guessing that all of these calls actually end up in the same function anyway since <code>&lt;</code> and <code>operator.lt</code> both map to <code>__lt__</code> on a numpy array, which is probably implemented using <code>numpy.less</code> or the equivalent?</p>

<p>So, which is more 'idiomatic' and 'preferred'?</p>

"15689260","1","","<p>I have a large application that has many small windows.  I wanted to use traitsui's file dialog to open some files from these windows.  However, when I do, the file dialog correctly spawns and picks a file, but it also consistently switches the active window to an undesirable window after it is finished.  I am really confused why.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified test which displays the same problem:</p>

<pre><code>from traitsui.api import *
from traits.api import *
from traitsui.file_dialog import *

class BigApplication(HasTraits):
  subwindow=Instance(HasTraits)
  open_subwindow=Button('clickme')

  traits_view=View(Item(name='open_subwindow'),height=500,width=500)

  def _subwindow_default(self):
    return Subwindow()

  def _open_subwindow_fired(self):
    self.subwindow.edit_traits()

class Subwindow(HasTraits):
  f=File
  some_option = Bool
  openf=Button('Browse for file')

  traits_view=View(Item(name='f',style='text'),
                Item(name='some_option'),
                Item(name='openf'),buttons=OKCancelButtons)

  def _openf_fired(self):
    self.f=open_file()

BigApplication().configure_traits()
</code></pre>

<p>When open_file returns and selects the desired file, the active window is switched to the BigApplication window and not back to the Subwindow window (so that the user can select some additional options before clicking OK).</p>

"38972503","1","","<p>I've been musing as to why the Python language's standard dict class doesn't support addition/subtraction operators such as '+' or '+=', e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo + bar 
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}

<p>Basically what I need to do is read  data from a certain file. I then need to remove the characters such as ("" ; : . , \n ' )  but only if they are at the start or end of the word. Currently my program removes every instance of these characters. For example I want to be able to turn ""cars"" into cars but ca""rs would stay as ca""rs</p>

"15690185","1","","<p>I know this question is pretty basic, and I'm sorry for posting it, but I literally have spent the last hour googling and I still havent found an answer.</p>

<p>I coded a blackjack game using pygame, and want to convert it to wxpython mostly as a way to learn wxpython. In pygame the graphics are easy, I have a base image I display (basically just the table), and then I can just display other images on top of it as the action unfolds, for example the cards. Each time the player hits I just draw a new card in a different position. When The hand is over and I want to go to the next hand, I just display the base image again, and it covers everything up and viola! Its really simple all I have to use is blit() and pygame.display.update().</p>

<p>I cant seem to find anyway to do this in wxpython. All the examples I find are for drawing items in new widgets, or drawing vector graphics over an image, or opening new frames with images, etc.</p>

<p>any help is greatly appreciated, thank you very much.</p>

"7844187","1","","<p>As an example, just a couple of dummy objects that will be used together.  FWIW this is using Python 2.7.2.</p>

<pre><code>class Student(object):
    def __init__(self, tool):
        self.tool = tool

    def draw(self):
        if self.tool.broken != True:

        print ""The %s busted."" % self.name
        self.broken = True

Hammer = Tool(hammer)
Billy = Student(Hammer)
Tommy = Student(Hammer)
</code></pre>

<p>That's probably enough code, you see where I'm going with this.  If I call Hammer.break(), I'm calling it on the same instance of the object; if Billy's hammer is broken, so is Tommy's (it's really the same Hammer after all).</p>

<p>Now obviously if the program were limited to just Billy and Tommy as instances of Students, the fix would be obvious - instantiate more Hammers.  But clearly I'm asking because it <em>isn't</em> that simple, heh.  I would like to know if it's possible to create objects which show up as unique instances of themselves for every time they're called into being.</p>

<p>EDIT: The kind of answers I'm getting lead me to believe that I have a gaping hole in my understanding of instantiation.  If I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo(object):
    pass

class Moo(Foo):
    pass

class Guy(object):
    def __init__(self, thing):
        self.thing = thing

Bill = Guy(Moo())
Steve = Guy(Moo())
</code></pre>

<p>Each time I use Moo(), is that a separate instance, or do they both reference the same object?  If they're <em>separate</em>, then my whole question can be withdrawn, because it'll ahve to make way for my mind getting blown.</p>

"31257489","1","","<h2>What's going on</h2>

<p>I'm collecting data from a few thousand network devices every few minutes in Python 2.7.8 via package <code>netsnmp</code>. I'm also using <code>fastsnmpy</code> so that I can access the (more efficient) Net-SNMP command <code>snmpbulkwalk</code>.</p>

<p>I'm trying to cut down how much memory my script uses. I'm running three instances of the same script which sleeps for two minutes before re-querying all devices for data we want. When I created the original script in <code>bash</code> they would use less than 500MB when active simultaneously. As I've converted this over to Python, however, each instance hogs 4GB <em>each</em> which indicates (to me) that my data structures need to be managed more efficiently. Even when idle they're consuming a total of 4GB.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Code Activity</h2>

<p>My script begins with creating a list where I open a file and append the hostname of our target devices as separate values. These usually contain 80 to 1200 names.</p>

<pre><code>expand = []
f = open(self.deviceList, 'r')
for line in f:
    line = line.strip()
    expand.append(line)
</code></pre>

<p>From there I set up the SNMP sessions and execute the requests</p>

<pre><code>expandsession = SnmpSession ( timeout = 1000000 ,
    retries = 1,            # I slightly modified the original fastsnmpy
    verbose = debug,        # to reduce verbose messages and limit
    oidlist = var,          # the number of attempts to reach devices
    targets = expand,
    community = 'expand'
)
expandresults = expandsession.multiwalk(mode = 'bulkwalk')
</code></pre>

<p>Because of how both SNMP packages behave, the device responses are parsed up into lists and stored into one giant data structure. For example,</p>

<pre><code>for output in expandresults:
    print ouput.hostname, output.iid, output.val
#
host1 1 1
host1 2 2
host1 3 3
host2 1 4
host2 2 5
host2 3 6
# Object 'output' itself cannot be printed directly; the value returned from this is obscure
...
</code></pre>

<p>I'm having to iterate through each response, combine related data, then output each device's complete response. This is a bit difficult For example,</p>

<pre><code>host1,1,2,3
host2,4,5,6
host3,7,8,9,10,11,12
host4,13,14
host5,15,16,17,18
...
</code></pre>

<p>Each device has a varying number of responses. I can't loop through expecting every device having a uniform arbitrary number of values to combine into a string to write out to a CSV.</p>

<hr>

<h2>How I'm handling the data</h2>

<p>I believe it is here where I'm consuming a lot of memory but I cannot resolve how to simplify the process while simultaneously removing visited data.</p>

<pre><code>expandarrays = dict()
for output in expandresults:
    if output.val is not None:
        if output.hostname in expandarrays:
            expandarrays[output.hostname] += ',' + output.val
        else:
            expandarrays[output.hostname] = ',' + output.val

for key in expandarrays:
    self.WriteOut(key,expandarrays[key])
</code></pre>

<p>Currently I'm creating a new dictionary, checking that the device response is not null, then appending the response value to a string that will be used to write out to the CSV file.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that I'm essentially cloning the existing dictionary, meaning I'm using twice as much system memory. I'd like to remove values that I've visited in <code>expandresults</code> when I move them to <code>expandarrays</code> so that I'm not using so much RAM. Is there an efficient method of doing this? Is there also a better way of reducing the complexity of my code so that it's easier to follow?</p>

<hr>

<h1>The Culprit</h1>

<p>Thanks to those who answered. For those in the future that stumble across this thread due to experiencing similar issues: the <code>fastsnmpy</code> package is the culprit behind the large use of system memory. The <code>multiwalk()</code> function creates a thread for each host but does so all at once rather than putting some kind of upper limit. Since each instance of my script would handle up to 1200 devices that meant 1200 threads were instantiated and queued within just a few seconds. Using the <code>bulkwalk()</code> function was slower but still fast enough to suit my needs. The difference between the two was 4GB vs 250MB (of system memory use).</p>

"31260814","1","","<p>How would I go about writing a recursive function that consumes two lists and then produces a list with the elements that are in both lists? If both lists have a number twice in each, the produced list will also have that number in it twice.

<p>On Unix, I have been successful in programming a Python tool that uses the <code>pexpect</code> library (via <code>pip install pexpect</code>). This code works perfectly and is exactly what I am trying to do. I've provided a small excerpt of my code for proof-of-concept below:</p>

<pre><code>self.process = pexpect.spawn('/usr/bin/ctf', env={'HOME':expanduser('~')}, timeout=5)
self.process.expect(self.PROMPT)
self.process.sendline('connect to %s' % server)

if sw == 0:
    pass
elif sw == 1:
    asked_for_pw = self.process.expect([pexpect.TIMEOUT, 'Password:'])
    if not asked_for_pw:
        self.process.sendline(user)
        self.process.expect('Password:')
    self.process.sendline(passwd)
    success = self.process.expect(['Password:', self.PROMPT])
    if not success:
        self.process.close()
        raise CTFError('Invalid password')
elif sw == 2:
    self.server = self.process.match.groups()[0]
    self.user = self.process.match.groups()[1].strip()
else:
    info('Could not match any strings, trying to get server and user')
    self.server = self.process.match.groups()[0]
    self.user = self.process.match.groups()[1].strip()
info('Connected to %s as %s' % (self.server, self.user))

<p>I tried running the same source on Windows (changing <code>/usr/bin/ctf</code> to <code>c:/ctf.exe</code>) and I receive an error message:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

<p>According to the <code>pexpect</code> <a href=""http://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#windows"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>pexpect.spawn</code> and <code>pexpect.run()</code> are not available on Windows, as they rely on Unix pseudoterminals (ptys). Cross platform code must not use these.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That led me on my search for a Windows equivalent. I have tried the popular <code>winpexpect</code> project <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/geertj/winpexpect/wiki/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and even a more recent (forked) version <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/weyou/winpexpect/wiki/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but neither of these projects seem to work. I use the method:</p>

<pre><code>self.process = winpexpect.winspawn('c:/ctf.exe', env={'HOME':expanduser('~')}, timeout=5)
</code></pre>

<p>only to sit and watch the Command Prompt do nothing (it seems as though it's trapped inside the <code>winspawn</code> method). I was wondering what other means I could go about programming a Python script to interact with the command line to achieve the same effect as I have been able to in Unix? If a suitable working Windows-version <code>pexpect</code> script does not exist, what other means could I use to go about this?</p>

<li>folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls</li>

<p>It's nasty.  How do I restructure?  I had 2 ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Main Folder containing: appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code.  Does this have to be my first package?</li>
<li>Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy</li>
<li>Individual subfolders for css, images, js, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?</p>

<ul>
<li>Subfolder for code + templates.  This way I have the handler class right next to the template, because in this stage, I'm adding lots of features, so modifications to one mean modifications to the other.  Again, do I have to have this folder name be the first package name for my classes?  I'd like the folder to be ""src"", but I don't want my classes to be ""src.WhateverPage""</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Is there a best practice?  With Django 1.0 on the horizon, is there something I can do now to improve my ability to integrate with it when it becomes the official GAE templating engine?  I would simply start trying these things, and seeing which seems better, but pyDev's refactoring support doesn't seem to handle package moves very well, so it will likely be a non-trivial task to get all of this working again.</p>

<li>Create a 365 values array of randomly generated integers between 0 and 4</li>

"38977041","1","","<p>First of all the question is tagged with <code>Python</code> and <code>regex</code> but it is not really tied to those - an answer can be high level.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm splitting a string with multiple delimiters with the following pattern. There are actually more delimiting patterns and they are more complex but let's keep it simple and limit them to 2 characters - <code>#</code> and <code>*</code>:</p>

<p><code>parts = re.split('#|*', string)</code></p>

<p>Which such approach a string <code>aaa#bbb*ccc#ddd</code> is split to 4 substrings <code>aaa</code>, <code>bbb</code>, <code>ccc</code>, <code>ddd</code>. But it is required to split either by a delimiter that occurs first in the string or by a delimiter that is most frequent in the string. <code>aaa#bbb*ccc#ddd</code> should be split to <code>aaa</code>, <code>bbb*ccc</code>, <code>ddd</code> and <code>aaa*bbb#ccc*ddd</code> should be split to <code>aaa</code>, <code>bbb#ccc</code>, <code>ddd</code>.</p>

<p>I know a straightforward way to achieve that - to find what delimiter occurs first or is the most frequent in a string and then split with that single delimiter. But the method has to be efficient and I'm wondering if it is possible to achieve that by a single regex expression. The question is mostly for splitting with the first occurance of the set of delimiters - for most frequent delimiter case almost for sure it will be required to calculate occurrence count in advance.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>The question does not ask to split by first occurrence or most frequent delimiter simultaneously - any of this methods individually will be sufficient. I do understand that splitting by most frequent delimiter is not possible with regex without preliminary determination of the delimiter but I think there's a chance that splitting by first occurrence is possible with regex and lookahead without preparation made in advance.</p>

<pre><code>repo = Repo('path to the directory which has .git folder')

"49455","1","","<p>Although the <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PDF specification</a> is available from Adobe, it's not exactly the simplest document to read through.  PDF allows documents to be encrypted so that either a user password and/or an owner password is required to do various things with the document (display, print, etc).  A common use is to lock a PDF so that end users can read it without entering any password, but a password is required to do anything else.</p>

<p>I'm trying to parse PDFs that are locked in this way (to get the same privileges as you would get opening them in any reader).  Using an empty string as the user password doesn't work, but it seems (section 3.5.2 of the spec) that there has to be a user password to create the hash for the admin password.</p>

<p>What I would like is either an explanation of how to do this, or any code that I can read (ideally Python, C, or C++, but anything readable will do) that does this so that I can understand what I'm meant to be doing.  Standalone code, rather than reading through (e.g.) the gsview source, would be best.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Based on the below information, <code>PYTHONPATH</code> does not need to be set unless there are non-standard libraries that you want python to be able to find by default. For instance, when I install <a href=""http://www.wxpython.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">wxPython</a> from the installer it will add its libraries to <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. I do set <code>PYTHONHOME</code> to the root of the python installation so that I can add it to my system <code>PATH</code> environment variable so that I can run python from any where.</p>

"38977360","1","","<p>I have a class called <code>run_c</code> which is being used to initialize and execute the run of a kinematics simulation. I assign default values to the attributes of <code>run_c</code>, such as <code>x</code>, before <code>run_c.__init__()</code> is executed. All <code>__init__()</code> is doing is extracting user-input values, aggregated into a dictionary, and assigning them to corresponding attributes in <code>run_c</code> if they exists. For example...</p>

<pre><code>import vars.Defaults as dft
class run_c:

   ...
   dt     = dft.dt
   x      = dft.x0
   states = [ [], [], [], [] ]
   ...

      for key in input.keys():
         if hasattr(self, key): setattr(self, key, input[key])
      ...
      self.execute()
</code></pre>

<p><code>run_c.states</code> is a list of lists that is being used to record the values of <code>run_c</code> attributes as they change with timesteps. Later, within <code>run_c.execute()</code>, I am storing <code>x</code> values in <code>states[1]</code>, incrementing the timestep <code>dt</code>, and updating <code>x</code> using velocity and timestep. It's pretty simple stuff, right?...</p>

<p>Here's where the problem begins, though. The first time that the instance of <code>run_c</code> is created, initialized, and executed, it runs perfectly. However, I am operating this simulation by creating, initializing, and executing multiple runs based off of list read from a JSON file. As such, in the driver module...</p>

<pre><code>from Run import run_c
def main():
   ...
   for runEntry in runList:
      currRun = run_c(runEntry)
      ...
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>What happens is that all the values that were stored in <code>run_c.states</code> do not get wiped after each iteration of the loop. I thought that new instances of <code>run_c</code> are being created every time I run the loop so as to execute <code>__init__()</code> fresh with new information. Why are the data values, such as old values for <code>x</code>, being retained after the end of each loop?</p>

<p>Update: When I add in a line of code to reset the values of <code>states</code> back to empty lists within <code>__init__()</code>, the problem goes away. But this shouldn't be a necessary step in what I want to do...should it?</p>

<p>I, however, would love not to have to use bindings like <code>&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelect&gt;&gt;</code> to change the corresponding data in the <code>Model</code>, but an Observer/Observable logic, which detects, that i.e. the entry <code>""Inputformat""</code> in the dictionary <code>self.shared_data</code> within the <code>Controller</code> was changed, which in turn refreshes the data in the <code>Model</code>, i.e. <code>self.model_data</code>, where the actual state of the <code>ttk.Combobox</code> is saved.</p>

<p>Here's my question.  I'd like to get rid of all the text-based user interaction.  How do I take object-based inputs and turn them into passable variables?  I've been able to implement wx.TextCtrl to enter user input and wx.FilePickerCtrl to select the PDF for the input.  Now how do I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pass these as variables to my resize_file function? </li>
<li>Set the output location?</li>
<li>Set the backup location + input PDF name?</li>
<li>Pass the wx.TextCtrl values (for scale) to my resize_file function?</li>
</ul>

<p>This also may be my problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a InitUI function doing all the wxPython stuff</li>
<li>The button within InitUi function calls resize_file_main</li>
<li>resize_file_main just handles inputs/outputs and moving the final
files around.  It also calls resize_file.</li>
<li>resize_file is a function that is re-used in several other areas
of the script.  It takes in the various inputs/outputs and actually
resizes the PDF(s).</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this a bad flow?  I wasn't sure how to combine resize_file_main and resize_file because the input/outputs with the different areas that call resize_file are different.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!  I know it's convoluted!</p>

"38978084","1","","<p>Ok I am not even sure the proper terminology to use to describe what I am trying to do. Anyway, I want to know if it is possible to programmatically or dynamically build a function call in python.</p>

<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p>I have a function inside a class that is defined with optional parameters like so:</p>

<pre><code>    class Agents(object):

        def update(self, agent_id, full_name = ""none"", role = ""none"", status = ""none""):
            # do some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>So when I when I go to use that function, I may be updating just one, two or all 3 of the optional parameters. Sometimes it may be full_name and role but not status... or status and role but not name, or just status, or well you get the idea.</p>

<p>So I could handle this with a big block of if elif statements to account for all the permutations but that strikes me as really clumsy.</p>

<p>Currently I am calling the function like so:</p>

<pre><code>    an_agent = Agents()
    an_agent.update(agent_id = r_agent_id)
</code></pre>

<p>Is there anyway to construct that function call programmatically, like appending the arguments to the call before making it. So that I can account for multiple scenarios like so:</p>

<pre><code>    an_agent = Agents()
    an_agent.update(agent_id = r_agent_id, full_name = r_full_name)
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre><code>    an_agent = Agents()
    an_agent.update(agent_id = r_agent_id, full_name = r_full_name, status = r_status)
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, what is the best way to approach this?</p>

"23522781","1","","<p>I'm looking to see if I could grab a hand on how to code an issue, preferably within the language Python. What I'd like to do is from 5 separate lists with 5 values in each find what the smallest sum of values would be, where each column/row can only have a value used once or twice. </p>

<p>For example in the following example:</p>

<pre><code>  ! p  ! q  ! r  ! s  ! t !

A !$98 !$96 !$93 !$88 !$86!

B !$76 !$75 !$70 !$68 !$64!

C !$64 !$64 !$66 !$60 !$59!

D !$56 !$55 !$62 !$58 !$57!

E !$50 !$56 !$53 !$48 !$49!

<p>The desired outcome is to find the smallest total value where only one p, q, r, s or t can be assigned to A, B, C, D or E. i.e. you cannot have 2 values in the p column used twice.
For example, the most simple possibility could be: 98 + 75 + 66 + 58 + 49 = ... but it must be the lowest possible total value.</p>

<p>I'm not sure whether this would be done with lists or arrays or what ever it may be. I really appreciate any help you can provide. </p>

"51502","1","","<p>I've been really enjoying Python programming lately. I come from a background of a strong love for C-based coding, where everything is perhaps more complicated than it should be (but puts hair on your chest, at least). So switching from C to Python for more complex things that don't require tons of speed has been more of a boon than a bane in writing projects.</p>

<p>However, coming from this land of brackets and parentheses and structs as far as the naked eye can see, I come across a small problem: I find Python difficult to read.</p>

<p>For example, the following block of text is hard for me to decipher unless I stare at it (which I dislike doing):</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs at the end of that if block: all the tabbing and then suddenly returning to a jarring block feels almost disturbing. As a solution, I've started coding my Python like this:</p>

<pre><code>if foo:
   bar = baz
   while bar not biz:
      bar = i_am_going_to_find_you_biz_i_swear_on_my_life()
   #-- while --
#-- if --

did_i_not_warn_you_biz()
my_father_is_avenged()
</code></pre>

<p>And this, for some odd reason, makes me more able to read my own code. But I'm curious: has anyone else with my strange problem found easier ways to make their tabbed-out code more readable? I'd love to find out if there's a better way to do this before this becomes a huge habit for me.</p>

<p>So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. </p>

<p>Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.</p>

<hr>

<p>No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.</p>

<p>The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)</p>

<p>I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.</p>

<p>The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.</p>

<p>I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)</p>

"7854945","1","","<p>I need to be able to manage the supervisord setup programmatically. Furthermore, not any user on the system should be able to to gain access to configuration of supervisord. For this reason, communication needs to be secured somehow.</p>

<p>I know that supervisord offers programmatic access in the form of XML-RPC. I read the documentation and attempted to work with it in several ways, but I keep running into problems.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>On the <a href=""http://supervisord.org/introduction.html#supervisor-components"" rel=""nofollow"">Introduction page</a>, the documentation recommends running an HTTP server for the XML-RPC interface and using the Python standard library <a href=""http://docs.python.org/release/2.6.5/library/xmlrpclib.html"" rel=""nofollow"">xmlrpclib</a> to communicate with it. There are two problems here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>inet_http_server</code> directive for supervisord.conf only includes username, password, and port as settings. There is no option to encrypt the connection.</li>
<li>xmlrpclib doesn't even support usernames and passwords. When I use the syntax <code>username:password@host:port</code>, I get <code>IOError: unsupported XML-RPC protocol</code>. As you can see in the example on the documentation page, no authentication occurs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Since UNIX sockets are secure, I figured that connecting to the <code>[unix_http_server]</code> with xmlrpclib would be a good idea. Still, I don't know how authentication would work, and furthermore, xmlrpclib only supports network HTTP/HTTPS servers.</p></li>
<li><p>Another page in the documentation mentions a <code>supervisor.rpcinterface</code> module. I have no access to such a thing in Python, though. To glean more information as to why that is, I re-installed supervisord with Pip. <code>sudo pip install --upgrade supervisor</code>. In the pip output, I see the line <code>Skipping installation of /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/supervisor/__init__.py (namespace package)</code>. I don't know why it would skip installation of the namespace package.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>How am I supposed to communicate programmatically and securely with supervisord?</p>

l2 = [[4, 8], [0], [6, 7], [3], [1], [5], [2]]

<p>The two lists represent mappings, that I already have. So I know some parts of my permutation but not all of them. As I see it, there are only four permutations possible:</p>

(4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 7, 6, 8)
(8, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 6, 7, 4)

I have a hard time generating the four tuples. This is what I have so far.</p>

            out[0] = out[0] + perms
    return out

print(get_permutations(l1))
</code></pre>

<p>Which prints <code>[(0, 8, 8, 0, 4, 6, 7, 7, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2)]</code>
How do I generate another tuple when I get to an entry in my list where more than one permutation of that list entry is possible?</p>

<p>I also know that <code>print(list(itertools.product(*l1)))</code> does almost what I want but not quite. It yields <code>[(0, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2), (0, 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2), (8, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 2), (8, 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2)]</code>. Maybe there is a way to modify that.</p>

"38981912","1","","<p>Lets say one has 600 annotated semantic segmentation mask images, which contain 10 different colors, each representing one entity. These images are in a numpy array of shape (600, 3, 72, 96), where n = 600, 3 = RGB channels, 72 = height, 96 = width. </p>

<p>How to map each RGB-pixel in the numpy array to a color-index-value? For example, a color list would be [(128, 128, 0), (240, 128, 0), ...n], and all (240, 128, 0) pixels in the numpy array would be converted to index value in unique mapping (= 1).</p>

   user_id int(5) not null,
   topic_id int(5) not null,
   post_date datetime not null,

   post_id int(5) not null,
   post_name varchar(255) not null default '',

<p>This is not what my tables look like really. I just want a basic idea how to do it. I can't even think of the least of solutions.

"23526308","1","","<p>Decorator pattern takes your function, decorates it with something else and returns you a new decorated function, and this is something I understand. </p>

<p>But when it comes to Python, I found the implementation of decorators little different. Let's say we have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>def helloWorld(func):
    print(func() + 1)

@helloWorld
def hello():
    return 2
</code></pre>

<p>My basic expectation was to call this method by saying <code>hello()</code> however, it somewhat worked with the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""C:/Python34/test.py"", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;
    hello()
TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable
</code></pre>

<p>So basically, when it hits <code>hello</code> part of <code>hello()</code>, it prints the correct result and returns <code>None</code> as any function without <code>return</code> statement does in Python. <code>()</code> is trying to invoke a <code>None</code> in this case. So I did this and it worked as I expected:</p>

<pre><code>def helloWorld(func):
    def inside():
        print(func() + 1)
    return inside

@helloWorld
def hello():
    return 2

hello()
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure whether my expectation justifies anything here. But as a person coming from C#, Java, etc. background, I found this little different. I was expecting the same behavior of the second code sample in the first one. What am I missing? Why was this designed in this way? Why is just saying <code>hello</code> is enough to invoke decorator function? What good does this design have? </p>

<h2>Update and Clarification</h2>

<p>I was expecting it to work without specifically returning a nested function in the decorator. So in the first example, <code>hello()</code> could have worked as if <code>helloWorld</code> was returning a nested method.</p>

<p>The solution given here is to <em>""install a GUI library (one of Tkinter, GTK, QT4, PySide, Wx)""</em>. I don't know how to do this. Furthermore, if I use:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib.rcsetup as rcsetup
print(rcsetup.all_backends)
</code></pre>

<p>I get:</p>

<pre><code>[u'GTK', u'GTKAgg', u'GTKCairo', u'MacOSX', u'Qt4Agg', u'Qt5Agg', u'TkAgg', u'WX', u'WXAgg', u'CocoaAgg', u'GTK3Cairo', u'GTK3Agg', u'WebAgg', u'nbAgg', u'agg', u'cairo', u'emf', u'gdk', u'pdf', u'pgf', u'ps', u'svg', u'template']
</code></pre>

<p>meaning that all those backends <em>are</em> available in my system (?).</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7534453/matplotlib-does-not-show-my-drawings-although-i-call-pyplot-show"">matplotlib does not show my drawings although I call pyplot.show()</a></p>

<p>My <code>matplotlibrc</code> file shows the line:</p>

<pre><code>backend      : Qt4Agg
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know how to make the virtualenv aware of this?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the solutions involve creating links to the system version of <code>matplotlib</code> (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/32439941/1391441"">here</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/35780169/1391441"">here</a>), which I don't want to do. I want to use the version of <code>matplotlib</code> installed in the <code>virtualenv</code>. </p>

<p>If I try to set the backend with:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('GTKAgg')
</code></pre>

<p>I get <code>ImportError: Gtk* backend requires pygtk to be installed</code> (same with <code>GTK</code>). But if I do <code>sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 python-gtk2-dev</code>, I see that they are both installed.</p>

<p>Using:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Qt4Agg')
</code></pre>

<p>(or <code>Qt5Agg</code>) results in <code>ImportError: Matplotlib qt-based backends require an external PyQt4, PyQt5, or PySide package to be installed, but it was not found.</code> Not sure if I should install some package?</p>

<p>Using:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
</code></pre>

<p>results in <code>ImportError: No module named _tkinter</code>, but <code>sudo apt-get install python-tk</code> says that it is installed.</p>

<p>Using:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('GTKCairo')
</code></pre>

<p>results in <code>ImportError: No module named gtk</code>. So I try <code>sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev</code> but it says that it already installed.</p>

<p>How can I make the virtualenv use the same backend that my system is using?</p>

"38981847","1","","<p>I apologise in advance, as I am rather new to Python programming, but I was curious as to how this system works. My question is: if I write a Python script and make it distributable, but my program imports other external libraries such as numpy or scipy (which is what I am working on currently) how does it all work together? It is my understanding that the user would still have to install the libraries separately or I need to write a separate makefile that runs a script to install it while my distributable is being installed. Am  I right in this opinion? Advice would be greatly appreciated. Also a explanation how it works internally given your answer. Thanks a lot! Appreciate your time! </p>

"58711","1","","<p>I have been playing with the Ruby library ""shoes"". Basically you can write a GUI application in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>Shoes.app do
  t = para ""Not clicked!""
  button ""The Label"" do
    alert ""You clicked the button!"" # when clicked, make an alert
    t.replace ""Clicked!"" # ..and replace the label's text
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This made me think - how would I design a similarly nice-to-use GUI framework in Python? One that doesn't have the usual tyings of basically being wrappers to a C* library (In the case of GTK, Tk, wx, QT etc etc)</p>

<p>Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like <code>#f0c2f0</code> style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like <code>:margin =&gt; 10</code>), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)</p>

<p>Python's lack of ""rubyish blocks"" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:</p>

<pre><code>def Shoeless(Shoes.app):
    self.t = para(""Not clicked!"")

    def on_click_func(self):
        alert(""You clicked the button!"")
        self.t.replace(""clicked!"")

    b = button(""The label"", click=self.on_click_func)
</code></pre>

<p>No where near as clean, and wouldn't be <em>nearly</em> as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.</p>

<p>Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:</p>

<pre><code>class BaseControl:
    def __init__(self):
        self.func = None

    def clicked(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self):
        if self.func is not None:
            self.func()

class Button(BaseControl):
    pass

class Label(BaseControl):
    pass

# The actual applications code (that the end-user would write)
class MyApp:
    ok = Button()
    la = Label()

    @ok.clicked
    def clickeryHappened():
        print ""OK Clicked!""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = MyApp()
    a.ok() # trigger the clicked action
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the decorator function stores the function, then when the action occurred (say, a click) the appropriate function would be executed.</p>

<p>The scope of various stuff (say, the <code>la</code> label in the above example) could be rather complicated, but it seems doable in a fairly neat manner..</p>

"31268373","1","","<p>I need to generate PDF from html tables, and was looking for a library that allows to take html tables with full CSS and make pdf. I'm trying to do this with PDFKit. I installed and I tested some simple examples that are explained in its documentation,it works. Documentation link:<a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfkit"" rel=""nofollow"">PDFKit</a></p>

<p>I have some tables like this,this is table that i want to convert to pdf: </p>

<pre><code> &lt;form action=""{{ url_for('patient_directory.make_pdf')}}"" method=""POST""&gt;
    &lt;button id=""download_s"" type=""submit"" class=""btn btn-success""&gt;Create PDF&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;table class=""patient-view-table"" id=""table_to_pdf""&gt;
      &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Surname&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Sex&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Date of birth&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/thead&gt;
      &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td class=""property-value-col""&gt;{{ patient.name }}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td class=""property-value-col""&gt;{{ patient.surname }}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td class=""property-value-col""&gt;{{ patient.sex }}&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td class=""property-value-col""&gt;{{ patient.date_of_birth }}&lt;/td&gt;    
          &lt;td class=""property-value-col""&gt;{{ patient.diagnosis }}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In form action of table above i called this method, I created a route method:</p>

<pre><code>mod_patient_directory.add_url_rule( '/pdf',methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def make_pdf(''):       
        pdfkit.from_string(table_to_pdf, 'example.pdf')
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is that when i try to generate pdf i don't know how to pass arguments, for example, how to make know that i want to generate to pdf table with <code>id=""table_to_pdf""</code>?
 Any help?</p>

    [ output &lt;output filename | - | PROMPT&gt; ] [ flatten ]
Where:
    &lt;operation&gt; may be empty, or: [generate_fdf | fill_form |dump_data | dump_data_fields ]
OPTIONS
--help, -h
    show summary of options.

&lt;input PDF files | - | PROMPT&gt;
    An input PDF file. Use - to pass a single PDF into pdftk via stdin.

[&lt;operation&gt; &lt;operation arguments&gt;]
    Available operations are:
    generate_fdf,fill_form, dump_data,dump_data_fields
    Some operations takes additional arguments, described below.

    generate_fdf
        Reads a single, input PDF file and generates an FDF file suitable for fill_form out of it
        to the given output filename or (if no output is given) to stdout. Does not create a new PDF.

    fill_form &lt;FDF data filename | - | PROMPT&gt;
        Fills the input PDF's form fields with the data from an FDF file, or stdin.
        Enter the data filename after fill_form, or use - to pass the data via stdin, like so:

        ./pdf_form.py form.pdf fill_form data.fdf output form.filled.pdf

        After filling a form, the form fields remain interactive unless flatten is used.
        flatten merges the form fields with the PDF pages. You can also use flatten alone, as shown:

        ./pdf_form.py form.pdf fill_form data.fdf output out.pdf flatten

        or:

        ./pdf_form.py form.filled.pdf output out.pdf flatten

    dump_data
        Reads a single, input PDF file and reports various statistics,  to the given output filename or (if no output is given).

    dump_data_fields
         Reads a single, input PDF file and reports form field statistics to the given output filename

[flatten]
    Use this option to merge an input PDF's interactive form fields and their data with the PDF's pages.

"23527435","1","","<p>I am having an issue in my Django project where I am importing the same module twice. This is causing a unit test of mine to fail: this unit test checks that the view found by resolving a URL is the same view imported from within the app being tested. So, my tests file looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>from django.core.urlresolvers import resolve
from django.tests import TestCase
from .views import index

class IndexText(TestCase):
    def test_root_url_resolves_to_index_view(self):
        found = resolve('/someapp/')
        import pdb; pdb.set_trace()           # Using this to debug because the below assertion is failing
        self.assertEqual(found.func, index)
</code></pre>

<p>The above assertion is failing because the two functions are not equal. When debugging in pdb, I found that <code>found.func.__module__</code> is <code>someapp.views</code> while <code>index.__module__</code> is <code>projectName.someapp.views</code>. </p>

<p>I was told in #django on Freenode this could be because although I had recently updated to Django 1.6, I was using the old 1.3 project structure, where the project settings.py and urls.py are in the root of the project alongside manage.py. </p>

<p>I've fixed that by creating a new directory within my project root, with the same name as the directory containing the project root, and placed my urls.py and settings.py in that directory. So, my directory structure looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/home
  /joseph
    /myWorkspace
      /projectName
        manage.py
        /projectName
          __init__.py
          urls.py
          settings.py
        /someapp
          __init__.py
          views.py
          tests.py
        /someotherapp
        / ... and so on ...
</code></pre>

<p>When I open a shell via <code>manage.py shell</code>, import sys, and print sys.path, the first directory in that list is <code>/home/joseph/myWorkspace/projectName</code> and that seems right to me. The rest of the python path looks pretty normal, pointing to different site packages, etc.  </p>

<p>However, when I run my test from above via <code>manage.py test someapp</code>, if I print the sys.path in pdb, I see that my python path first contains <code>/home/joseph/myWorkspace</code>, and <em>also</em> <code>/home/joseph/myWorkspace/projectName</code>. This does not seem correct to me, and I think this may be why I am having issues with double imports. </p>

<p>I am not setting PYTHONPATH in my environment variables. As far as I know, I am also not making any adjustments to sys.path within my apps or settings. </p>

<p>I don't know where to go from here, can anyone lend some insight? </p>

<p>Basically, this does what I need it to do except that we now want to run the script with the domain credentials <strong>without</strong> prompting the user for a username and password.  Ideally, we'd want to run this during maintenance windows, and we would rather have a domain account's credentials handle the authentication instead of baking it in to the script for anyone to stumble upon.  </p>

I want, however, to open multiple dummy file writers in a with statement context.</p>

<p>Say I create two dummy files: <code>touch a</code> and <code>touch b</code>.</p>

<p>Given the first part of the script:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/python

from contextlib import contextmanager

# File names
fa=""a""
fb=""b""

# Dummy file handler
none_context = contextmanager(lambda: iter([None]))()
</code></pre>

<p>This addition works with a single dummy file writer (it prints <code>2</code>):</p>

<pre><code>printing=False
with (open(fa) if printing else none_context) as writter:
    print 1 if printing else 2
</code></pre>

<p>This also works, because we are indeed reading files (it prints <code>1</code>):</p>

<pre><code>printing=True
with (open(fa, ""r"") if printing else none_context) as writter, \
    (open(fb, ""r"") if printing else none_context) as another_writter:
    print 1 if printing else 2
</code></pre>

<p>However, it doesn't work if we are using two dummy file writers:</p>

<pre><code>printing=False
with (open(fa, ""r"") if printing else none_context) as writter, \
    (open(fb, ""r"") if printing else none_context) as another_writter:
    print 1 if printing else 2
</code></pre>

<p>It shows the error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):

"31272427","1","","<p>I have to apologise in advance 'cause this question is quite general and may be not clear enough. The question is: how would you run in parallel a Python function that itself uses a pool of processes for some subtasks and does lots of heavy I/O operations? Is it even a valid task?</p>

<p>I will try to provide some more information. I've got a procedure, say <code>test_reduce()</code>, that I need to run in parallel. I tried several ways to do that (see below), and I seem to lack some knowledge to understand why all of them fail.</p>

<p>This <code>test_reduce()</code> procedure does <em>lots</em> of things. Some of those are more relevant to the question than others (and I list them below):</p>

<ul>
<li>It uses the <code>multiprocessing</code> module <strong>(sic!)</strong>, namely a <code>pool.Pool</code> instance,</li>
<li>It uses a MongoDB connection,</li>
<li>It relies heavily on <code>numpy</code> and <code>scikit-learn</code> libs,</li>
<li>It uses callbacks and lambdas,</li>
<li>It uses the <code>dill</code> lib to pickle some stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>First I tried to use a <code>multiprocessing.dummy.Pool</code> (which seems to be a thread pool). I don't know what is specific about this pool and why it is, eh, ""dummy""; the whole thing worked, and I got my results. <strong>The problem</strong> is CPU load. For parallelized sections of <code>test_reduce()</code> it was 100% for all cores; for synchronous sections it was around 40-50% most of the time. I can't say there was any increase in overall speed for this type of ""parallel"" execution. </p>

<p>Then I tried to use a <code>multiprocessing.pool.Pool</code> instance to <code>map</code> this procedure to my data. It failed with the following:</p>

<pre><code>File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/pool.py"", line 251, in map
    return self.map_async(func, iterable, chunksize).get()
  File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/multiprocessing/pool.py"", line 558, in get
    raise self._value
cPickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle &lt;type 'thread.lock'&gt;: attribute lookup thread.lock failed
</code></pre>

<p>I made a guess that <code>cPickle</code> is to blame, and found the <code>pathos</code> lib that uses a far more advanced pickler <code>dill</code>. However it also fails:</p>

<pre><code>File ""/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dill/dill.py"", line 199, in load
    obj = pik.load()
  File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/pickle.py"", line 858, in load
    dispatch[key](self)
  File ""/usr/lib/python2.7/pickle.py"", line 1083, in load_newobj
    obj = cls.__new__(cls, *args)
TypeError: object.__new__(generator) is not safe, use generator.__new__()
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <em>this</em> error is something I don't understand at all. I've got no output to <code>stdout</code> from my procedure when it works in a pool, so it's hard to guess what's going on. The only thing I know is that <code>test_reduce()</code> runs successfully when no multiprocessing is used.</p>

<p>So, how would you run in parallel something that heavy and complicated?</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to replicate that in Python. I've tried using the above code and many variations of it, but every time I receive the response 'FAILED_TO_PARSE_REQUEST_BODY'. What's different between the Ajax and Python calls that makes my request fail? </p>

<p>This question is similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35326206/simulating-ajax-request-with-python-using-the-requests-lib"">this</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22183899/simulating-ajax-request-with-python-using-requests-lib"">this</a>, but they deal with using the same key multiple times and incorrect data encoding, which I do not think applies in this case. </p>

<p>EDIT:<br>
The only log I see is

    import etree from lxml</p>

<p>Also to give you some more background on what I am trying to do. I got the readability code from here (<a href=""https://github.com/buriy/python-readability"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/buriy/python-readability</a>) and trying to use it in my project. </p>

<p>EDIT2: I fixed the problem but still do not understand why. I wanted to use the code from the readability project directly without installing the package using easy_install. The idea was step into the code so that I understand what its doing. But when I copy the code into my project I get the above mentioned error in the readability code. If I install the package using easy_install then all I can simply import the class exported by readability and use it.</p>

<p>So can some one tell me what the difference is between using the code directly and the package installed? What is a .egg file? How to create one?</p>

<p><strong>Virtualenv:</strong></p>

<p>I'm trying to execute a python script within a SRC block using a virtual environment instead of my system's python implementation. I have a number of libraries in this virtual environment that I don't have on my system's python (e.g. Matplotlib). Now, I set <code>python-shell-virtualenv-path</code> to my virtualenv's root directory. When I run <code>M-x run-python</code> the shell runs from my virtual environment. That is, I can import Matplotlib with no problems. But when I import Matplotlib within a SRC block I get an import error. </p>

<ol>
<li>How can I have it so the SRC block uses the python in my virtual
environment and not my system's python? </li>
<li>Is there any way I can set
    the path to a given virtual environment automatically when I load an
    org file?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>HTML5 Export:</strong></p>

<p>I'm trying to export my org-files in 'html5', as opposed to the default 'xhtml-strict'. The manual says to set <code>org-html-html5-fancy</code> to <code>t</code>. I tried searching for <code>org-html-html5-fancy</code> in <code>M-x org-customize</code> but I couldn't find it. I tried adding <code>(setq org-html-html5-fancy t)</code> to my init.el, but nothing happened. I'm not at all proficient in emacs-lisp so my syntax may be wrong. The manual also says I can set <code>html5-fancy</code> in an options line. I'm not really sure how to do this. I tried <code>#+OPTIONS html5-fancy: t</code> but it didn't do anything.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I export to 'html5' instead of 'xhtml-strict' in org version
7.9.3f and Emacs version 24.3.1?</li>
<li>Is there any way I can view and customize the back-end that parses
the org file to produce the html?</li>

listbox = tk.Listbox(master, selectmode=tk.SINGLE)

button.pack()

I know I can add scroll bars and make the window re-sizable and make the listbox fit the space it's given, but I would like it to work without having to resize stuff. I know it's not that important but it's just one of those things that I would love to work but can't figure out :/ .</p>
