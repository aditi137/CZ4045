"35667","2","22059","<p>I'm not familiar with the specific services listed, but the field of natural language processing has developed a number of techniques that enable this sort of information extraction from general text.  As Sean stated, once you have candidate terms, it's not to difficult to search for those terms with some of the other entities in context and then use the results of that search to determine how confident you are that the term extracted is an actual entity of interest.</p>

<p><a href=""http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenNLP</a> is a great project if you'd like to play around with natural language processing.  The capabilities you've named would probably be best accomplished with Named Entity Recognizers (NER) (algorithms that locate proper nouns, generally, and sometimes dates as well) and/or Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (eg: the word 'bank' has different meanings depending on it's context, and that can be very important when extracting information from text.  Given the sentences: ""the plane banked left"", ""the snow bank was high"", and ""they robbed the bank"" you can see how dissambiguation can play an important part in language understanding)</p>

<p>Techniques generally build on each other, and NER is one of the more complex tasks, so to do NER successfully, you will generally need accurate tokenizers (natural language tokenizers, mind you -- statistical approaches tend to fare the best), string stemmers (algorithms that conflate similar words to common roots: so words like informant and informer are treated equally), sentence detection ('Mr. Jones was tall.' is only one sentence, so you can't just check for punctuation), part-of-speech taggers (POS taggers), and WSD.</p>

<p>There is a python port of (parts of) OpenNLP called NLTK (<a href=""http://nltk.sourceforge.net"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://nltk.sourceforge.net</a>) but I don't have much experience with it yet.  Most of my work has been with the Java and C# ports, which work well.  </p>

<p>All of these algorithms are language-specific, of course, and they can take significant time to run (although, it is generally faster than reading the material you are processing).  Since the state-of-the-art is largely based on statistical techniques, there is also a considerable error rate to take into account.  Furthermore, because the error rate impacts all the stages, and something like NER requires numerous stages of processing, (tokenize -> sentence detect -> POS tag -> WSD -> NER) the error rates compound.</p>

For example, a copying gc traverses the ""live"" objects and copies them to a new space, and can reclaim all the ""dead"" objects in one step by marking a whole memory region. This is very efficient, <em>if</em> you have enough memory. Generational collections use the knowledge that ""most objects die young""; often only a few percent of objects have to be copied.</p>

This is nice when you want to attach finalizers to objects (e.g. to close a file once the File object gets unreachable). A reference counting system can work even when only a few percent of the memory is free. But the management cost of having to increment and decrement counters upon each pointer assignment cost a lot of time, and some kind of garbage collection is still needed to reclaim cycles.</p>

<p>Perl's strings and regular expressions are 8-bit byte based (as opposed to utf16 for Java for example), so Perl's native 'character type' is the same encoding of the mmapped file.</p>

<p>The mmap is probably largely responsible for the performance difference vs the Python version using the normal Python IO libraries -  which additionally introduce the overhead of looking for line breaks.</p>

<p>The Perl program also supports a -J to parallelize the processing, where the oepen ""-|"" causes a fork() where the file handle in the parent is to the child's stdout.

"143995","2","120926","<p>The answer to the question is: PEP-8 wants to make a recommendation and has decided that since spaces are more popular it will strongly recommend spaces over tabs.</p>

<hr>

<p>Notes on PEP-8</p>

<p>PEP-8 says <em>'Use 4 spaces per indentation level.'</em><br>
Its clear that this is the standard recommendation.</p>

<p><em>'For really old code that you don't want to mess up, you can continue to use 8-space tabs.'</em><br>
Its clear that there are SOME circumstances when tabs can be used.</p>

<p><em>'Never mix tabs and spaces.'</em><br>
This is a clear prohibition of mixing - I think we all agree on this.  Python can detect this and often chokes.  Using the -tt argument makes this an explicit error.</p>

<p><em>'The most popular way of indenting Python is with spaces only.  The second-most popular way is with tabs only.'</em><br>
This clearly states that both are used.  Just to be ultra-clear: You should still never mix spaces and tabs in same file.</p>

<p><em>'For new projects, spaces-only are strongly recommended over tabs.'</em><br>
This is a clear recommendation, and a strong one, but not a prohibition of tabs.</p>

<hr>

<p>I can't find a good answer to my own question in PEP-8. 
I use tabs, which I have used historically in other languages.
Python accepts source with exclusive use of tabs.  That's good enough for me.</p>

<p>I thought I would have a go at working with spaces.  In my editor, I configured a file type to use spaces exclusively and so it inserts 4 spaces if I press tab.  If I press tab too many times, I have to delete the spaces!  <strong>Arrgh!</strong>  Four times as many deletes as tabs!  My editor can't tell that I'm using 4 spaces for indents (although AN editor might be able to do this) and obviously insists on deleting the spaces one at a time.</p>

<p>Couldn't Python be told to consider tabs to be n spaces when its reading indentations?
If we could agree on 4 spaces per indentation and 4 spaces per tab and allow Python to accept this, then there would be no problems.<br>
We should find win-win solutions to problems.</p>
",""
"144096","2","120926","<p>The main problems with indentation occur when you mix tabs and spaces.  Obviously this doesn't tell you which you should choose, but it is a good reason to to recommend one, even if you pick it by flipping a coin.</p>

<p>However, IMHO there are a few minor reasons to favour spaces over tabs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Different tools.  Sometimes code gets displayed outside of a programmer's editor.  Eg. posted to a newsgroup or forum.  Spaces generally do better than tabs here - everywhere spaces would get mangled, tabs do as well, but not vice-versa.</p></li>
<li><p>Programmers see the source differently.  This is deeply subjective - its either the main benefit of tabs, or a reason to avoid them depending on which side you're on.  On the plus side, developers can view the source with their preferred indentation, so a developer preferring 2-space indent can work with an 8-space developer on the same source and still see it as they like.  The downside is that there are repercussions to this - some people like 8-space because it gives very visible feedback that they're too deeply nested - they may see code checked in by the 2-indenter constantly wrapping in their editor.  Having every developer see the code the same way leads to more consistency wrt line lengths, and other matters too.</p></li>
<li><p>Continued line indentation.  Sometimes you want to indent a line to indicate it is carried from the previous one.  eg.</p>

<pre><code>def foo():
    x = some_function_with_lots_of_args(foo, bar, baz,
                                        xyzzy, blah)
</code></pre>

<p>If using tabs, theres no way to align this for people using different tabstops in their editor without mixing spaces and tabs.  This effectively kills the above benefit.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously though, this is a deeply religious issue, which programming is plagued with.  The most important issue is that we should choose one - even if thats not the one you favour.  Sometimes I think that the biggest advantage of significant indentation is that at least we're spared brace placement flamewars.</p>

"196487","2","21934","<p>Actually reference counting and the strategies used by the Sun JVM are all different types of garbage collection algorithms.</p>

<p>There are two broad approaches for tracking down dead objects: tracing and reference counting. In tracing the GC starts from the ""roots"" - things like stack references, and traces all reachable (live) objects. Anything that can't be reached is considered dead. In reference counting each time a reference is modified the object's involved have their count updated. Any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead.</p>

<p>With basically all GC implementations there are trade offs but tracing is usually good for high through put (i.e. fast) operation but has longer pause times (larger gaps where the UI or program may freeze up). Reference counting can operate in smaller chunks but will be slower overall. It may mean less freezes but poorer performance overall.</p>

<p>Additionally a reference counting GC requires a cycle detector to clean up any objects in a cycle that won't be caught by their reference count alone. Perl 5 didn't have a cycle detector in its GC implementation and could leak memory that was cyclic.</p>

  <p>what is a ""Unicode string"" in Python? Does that mean UCS-2?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unicode strings in Python are stored internally either as UCS-2 (fixed-length 16-bit representation, almost the same as UTF-16) or UCS-4/UTF-32 (fixed-length 32-bit representation). It's a compile-time option; on Windows it's always UTF-16 whilst many Linux distributions set UTF-32 (‘wide mode’) for their versions of Python.</p>

<p>You are generally not supposed to care: you will see Unicode code-points as single elements in your strings and you won't know whether they're stored as two or four bytes. If you're in a UTF-16 build and you need to handle characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane you'll be Doing It Wrong, but that's still very rare, and users who really need the extra characters should be compiling wide builds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>plain wrong, or is it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it's quite wrong. To be fair I think that tutorial is rather old; it probably pre-dates wide Unicode strings, if not Unicode 3.1 (the version that introduced characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane).</p>

<p>There is an additional source of confusion stemming from Windows's habit of using the term “Unicode” to mean, specifically, the UTF-16LE encoding that NT uses internally. People from Microsoftland may often copy this somewhat misleading habit.</p>

"821663","2","22059","<p>Michal Finkelstein from OpenCalais here.</p>

<p>First, thanks for your interest. I'll reply here but I also encourage you to read more on OpenCalais forums; there's a lot of information there including - but not limited to:
<a href=""http://opencalais.com/tagging-information"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://opencalais.com/tagging-information</a>
<a href=""http://opencalais.com/how-does-calais-learn"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://opencalais.com/how-does-calais-learn</a>
Also feel free to follow us on Twitter (@OpenCalais) or to email us at team@opencalais.com</p>

<p>Now to the answer:</p>

<p>OpenCalais is based on a decade of research and development in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics.</p>

<p>We support the full ""NLP Stack"" (as we like to call it):
From text tokenization, morphological analysis and POS tagging, to shallow parsing and identifying nominal and verbal phrases.</p>

<p>Semantics come into play when we look for Entities (a.k.a. Entity Extraction, Named Entity Recognition). For that purpose we have a sophisticated rule-based system that combines discovery rules as well as lexicons/dictionaries. This combination allows us to identify names of companies/persons/films, etc., even if they don't exist in any available list.</p>

<p>For the most prominent entities (such as people, companies) we also perform anaphora resolution, cross-reference and name canonization/normalization at the article level, so we'll know that 'John Smith' and 'Mr. Smith', for example, are likely referring to the same person.
So the short answer to your question is - no, it's not just about matching against large databases.</p>

<p>Events/Facts are really interesting because they take our discovery rules one level deeper; we find relations between entities and label them with the appropriate type, for example M&amp;As (relations between two or more companies), Employment Changes (relations between companies and people), and so on. Needless to say, Event/Fact extraction is not possible for systems that are based solely on lexicons.
For the most part, our system is tuned to be precision-oriented, but we always try to keep a reasonable balance between accuracy and entirety.</p>

<p>By the way there are some cool new metadata capabilities coming out later this month so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Michal</p>

<p>pywhois - Python module for retrieving WHOIS information of domains</p>

<p>Goal:
- Create a simple importable Python module which will produce parsed WHOIS data for a given domain.
- Able to extract data for all the popular TLDs (com, org, net, ...)
- Query a WHOIS server directly instead of going through an intermediate web service like many others do.
- Works with Python 2.4+ and no external dependencies</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pywhois
&gt;&gt;&gt; w = pywhois.whois('google.com')
&gt;&gt;&gt; w.expiration_date
['14-sep-2011']
&gt;&gt;&gt; w.emails
['contact-admin@google.com',

 'dns-admin@google.com',

elif match_objects.setdefault( 'mo_baz', re_baz.search( text ) ):

<p>however, you must ensure there are no duplicate match_objects dictionary keys ( mo_foo, mo_bar, ... ), best by giving each regular expression its own name and naming the match_objects keys accordingly, otherwise match_objects.setdefault() method would return existing match object instead of creating new match object by running re_xxx.search( text ).</p>

",""
"4474859","2","124604","<p>Perl 6 has some great features over python.  I think these are all features that Python 3 doesn't have:</p>

<ul>
<li>an extensible, but optional type system
<ul>
<li>including multi-method dispatch and type checking</li>
<li>even for builtins and ""operators""</li>
<li>with subset types</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Roles: Non-instantiable classes for code reuse (aka mixins)
<ul>
<li>with some additional advantages over most mixins: </li>
<li>compile-time method name collision checking, </li>
<li>the ability to require, in a role definition, that certain methods are present in the host class, and subsequently to call methods of the host class in the implementation of the role.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grammars (compositions of regexes  that return structured data)</li>
<li>Powerful extended regexes.  Fancier than python's built-in regex capabilities.</li>
<li>Junctions and type junctions</li>
<li>Metaoperators</li>
<li>The ability to define circumfix, postcircumfix, infix, prefix, and postfix operators.</li>
<li>Theoretically, the ability to work with the AST as structured data.  (Aka: lisp macros)</li>
<li>Block scoping</li>
<li>The * term for generating closures out of any expression</li>
<li>Implicit concurrency constructs ([] meta, junctions)</li>
<li>Declarative concurrency constructs (hyper for)</li>
<li>The MAIN sub turns its function signature into a command line interface and a command line usage guide.</li>
<li>Lazy lists (but you can roll your own with generators)</li>
</ul>

<p>And it shares with Python the following advantages over Perl 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>The concept of a ""class"", the class keyword, and associated sugar**:
<ul>
<li>The self keyword</li>
<li>getter/setter sugar with the concept of private data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a well defined, accessible meta-object protocol</li>
<li>great unicode support</li>
<li>great date/time support built in</li>
<li>In general, ""batteries included"" - lots of builtin functions</li>
<li>non-globally scoped variables by default</li>
</ul>

<p>Perl6's implementation is not 100% complete, or tuned enough to use for certain values of ""performance sensitive"" applications.  But the 80-90% of the spec that is needed for 95-99% of use cases is complete in Rakudo, right now*</p>

<p>*One glaring omission is any provision for asynchronous I/O.  That part of the spec is in flux.</p>

I use tabs exclusively. I know very well why.</p>

<p>Tabs are actually a cool invention, that came <strong>after</strong> spaces. It allows you to indent without pushing space millions of times or using a fake tab (that produces spaces).</p>

<p>I really don't get why everybody is discriminating the use of tabs.
It is very much like old people discriminating younger people for choosing a newer more efficient technology and complaining that pulse dialing works on <strong>every phone</strong>, not just on these fancy new ones. ""Tone dialing doesn't work on every phone, that's why it is wrong"".</p>

<p>Your editor cannot handle tabs properly? Well, get a <strong>modern</strong> editor. Might be darn time, we are now in the 21st century and the time when an editor was a high tech complicated piece of software is long past. We have now tons and tons of editors to choose from, all of them that support tabs just fine. Also, you can define how much a tab should be, a thing that you cannot do with spaces. 
Cannot see tabs? What is that for an argument? Well, you cannot see spaces neither!</p>

<p>May I be so bold to suggest to get a better editor? One of these high tech ones, that were released some 10 years ago already, that <strong>display invisible characters</strong>? (sarcasm off)</p>

<p>The issue was... since the width of tabs and spaces both can vary -- and since programmers can't agree on either width -- why is it that tabs bear the blame.</p>

<p>I agree with Jim on that -- tabs are NOT evil in and of themselves. But there is a problem...</p>

<p>With spaces I can control how <strong><em>""MY OWN CODE""</em></strong>  looks in EVERY editor in the world. If I use 4 spaces -- then no matter what editor you open my code in, it will have the same distance from the left margin. With tabs I am at the mercy of the tab-width setting for the editor -- even for MY OWN CODE. And I don't like that.</p>

<p>So while it is true that even spaces can't guarantee consistency -- they at least afford you more control over the look of your OWN code everywhere -- something that tabs can't.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can create an extension module yourself that provides the data structure that you're after.  If it's really just something like a collection of shorts, then
that's pretty simple to do.</li>
<li>You can
cheat and manipulate bits, so that
you're storing one number in the
lower half of the Python int, and
another one in the upper half. 
You'd write some utility functions

<p>It's also worth realising that a Python integer object is not 4 bytes - there is additional overhead.  So if you have a really large number of shorts, then you can save more than two bytes per number by using a C short in some way (e.g. the array module).</p>

<p>I had to keep a large set of integers in memory a while ago, and a dictionary with integer keys and values was too large (I had 1GB available for the data structure IIRC).

In Python you have tuple assignment, so you can say <code>spam, eggs = nee()</code> but in Java you'd need to either resort to mutable out parameters or have a custom class with 2 fields and then have two additional lines of code to extract those fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in syntax for lists and dictionaries.</p></li>
<li><p>Operator Overloading.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally better designed libraries.  For example, to parse an XML document in Java, you say<br>
<code>Document doc = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance().newDocumentBuilder().parse(""test.xml"");</code><br>
and in Python you say<br>
<code>doc = parse(""test.xml"")</code></p></li>

<p>Anyway, I could go on and on with further examples, but Python is just overall a much more flexible and expressive language.  It's also dynamically typed, which I really like, but which comes with some disadvantages.</p>

<p>Java has much better performance than Python and has way better tool support.  Sometimes those things matter a lot and Java is the better language than Python for a task; I continue to use Java for some new projects despite liking Python a lot more.

"7826363","2","21934","<p>One big disadvantage of Java's tracing GC is that from time to time it will  ""stop the world"" and freeze the application for a relatively long time to do a full GC. If the heap is big and the the object tree complex, it will freeze for a few seconds. Also each full GC visits the whole object tree over and over again, something that is probably quite inefficient. Another drawback of the way Java does GC is that you have to tell the jvm what heap size you want (if the default is not good enough); the JVM derives from that value several thresholds that will trigger the GC process when there is too much garbage stacking up in the heap.</p>

<pre><code>import readline

    def complete(self, text, state):
        if state == 0:  # on first trigger, build possible matches
            if text:  # cache matches (entries that start with entered text)

<blockquote>
  <p>""And better yet would be if it would complete words not only from the beginning ... completion from arbitrary part of the string.""</p>

<h3>Updates: using the history buffer (as mentioned in comments)</h3>

<p>A simple way to create a pseudo-menu for scrolling/searching is to load the keywords into the history buffer. You will then be able to scroll through the entries using the up/down arrow keys as well as use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to perform a reverse-search.</p>

<p>To try this out, make the following changes:</p>

<pre><code>keywords = [""hello"", ""hi"", ""how are you"", ""goodbye"", ""great""]

readline.set_completer(completer.complete)

input = raw_input(""Input: "")
print ""You entered"", input

<p>When you run the script, try typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> followed by <kbd>a</kbd>. That will return the first match that contains ""a"". Enter <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>r</kbd> again for the next match. To select an entry, press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.</p>

class WikiPage(object): pass
class Comment(object): pass

<h1>1. Finding the files</h1>

<p>Firstly, I use this code to actually find the root of the GTK runtime. This is very specific to how you install the runtime, though, and could probably be improved with a number of checks for common locations:</p>

<pre><code>#gtk file inclusion
import gtk
# The runtime dir is in the same directory as the module:
GTK_RUNTIME_DIR = os.path.join(
    os.path.split(os.path.dirname(gtk.__file__))[0], ""runtime"")

assert os.path.exists(GTK_RUNTIME_DIR), ""Cannot find GTK runtime data""
</code></pre>

<h1>2. What files to include</h1>

<p>This depends on (a) how much of a concern size is, and (b) the context of your application's deployment. By that I mean, are you deploying it to the whole wide world where anyone can have an arbitrary locale setting, or is it just for internal corporate use where you don't need translated stock strings?</p>

<p>If you want Windows theming, you'll need to include:</p>

<pre><code>GTK_THEME_DEFAULT = os.path.join(""share"", ""themes"", ""Default"")
GTK_THEME_WINDOWS = os.path.join(""share"", ""themes"", ""MS-Windows"")
GTK_GTKRC_DIR = os.path.join(""etc"", ""gtk-2.0"")
GTK_GTKRC = ""gtkrc""
GTK_WIMP_DIR = os.path.join(""lib"", ""gtk-2.0"", ""2.10.0"", ""engines"")
GTK_WIMP_DLL = ""libwimp.dll""
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the Tango icons:</p>

<pre><code>GTK_ICONS = os.path.join(""share"", ""icons"")
</code></pre>

<p>There is also localisation data (which I omit, but you might not want to):</p>

<pre><code>GTK_LOCALE_DATA = os.path.join(""share"", ""locale"")
</code></pre>

<h1>3. Piecing it together</h1>

<p>Firstly, here's a function that walks the filesystem tree at a given point and produces output suitable for the  <a href=""http://www.py2exe.org/index.cgi/ListOfOptions"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>data_files</code></a> option.</p>

<pre><code>def generate_data_files(prefix, tree, file_filter=None):
    """"""
    Walk the filesystem starting at ""prefix"" + ""tree"", producing a list of files
    suitable for the data_files option to setup(). The prefix will be omitted
    from the path given to setup(). For example, if you have

        C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime\etc\...

    ...and you want your ""dist\"" dir to contain ""etc\..."" as a subdirectory,
    invoke the function as

        generate_data_files(
            r""C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime"",
            r""etc"")

    If, instead, you want it to contain ""runtime\etc\..."" use:

        generate_data_files(
            r""C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0"",
            r""runtime\etc"")

    Empty directories are omitted.

    file_filter(root, fl) is an optional function called with a containing
    directory and filename of each file. If it returns False, the file is
    omitted from the results.
    """"""
    data_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(os.path.join(prefix, tree)):        
        to_dir = os.path.relpath(root, prefix)

        if file_filter is not None:
            file_iter = (fl for fl in files if file_filter(root, fl))
        else:
            file_iter = files

        data_files.append((to_dir, [os.path.join(root, fl) for fl in file_iter]))

    non_empties = [(to, fro) for (to, fro) in data_files if fro]

    return non_empties
</code></pre>

<p>So now you can call <code>setup()</code> like so:</p>

<pre><code>setup(
    # Other setup args here...

    data_files = (
                    # Use the function above...

                    generate_data_files(GTK_RUNTIME_DIR, GTK_THEME_WINDOWS) +
                    generate_data_files(GTK_RUNTIME_DIR, GTK_ICONS) +

                    # ...or include single files manually

                        (GTK_GTKRC_DIR, [

You may find it easiest to do token substitution, i.e. take a base script, put in strings that you'll simply find (i.e. the tokens) &amp; replace (i.e. substitution with your desired strings), and then execute the revised script.</p>

<p>For instance, using the script at the link above (saved in a local directory as ""sendmail_base.py""):</p>

<pre><code>BasePy  = scan(""sendmail_base.py"", what = ""character"", sep = ""\n"")
OutPy = gsub(""your_email@gmail.com"", ""yourRealEmailAddress"", InFile)
OutPy = gsub(""your_password"", ""yourRealPassword"", OutFile)

<p>and so on, replacing the header, recipient, etc., with the text strings you'd like to use, and the same for specification of the attachment file name.  Finally, you can save the output to a new Python file and execute it:</p>

<pre><code>cat(OutPy, file = ""sendmail_new.py"", sep = ""\n"")
system(""chmod u+x sendmail_new.py; ./sendmail_new.py"")
</code></pre>

<p>Although this is a very naive approach, it is simple and debugging of the script involves only examination of whether your output Python program is working and whether or not R is generating the right output Python program.  This is in contrast to debugging what's going on with R passing objects to and from various packages and languages.</p>

<p>Since you haven't called <code>f.close()</code> yet, the file is <strong>not</strong> removed. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile"">doc</a> for <code>NamedTemporaryFile</code> says: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Whether the name can be used to open the file a second time, while the named temporary file is still open, varies across platforms (it can be so used on Unix; it cannot on Windows NT or later). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And for <code>TemporaryFile</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under Unix, the directory entry for the file is removed immediately after the file is created. Other platforms do not support this; your code should not rely on a temporary file created using this function having or not having a visible name in the file system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, to persist a temporary file (on Windows), you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import tempfile, shutil
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t', delete=False)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.write('foo')
&gt;&gt;&gt; file_name = f.name

&gt;&gt;&gt; shutil.copy(file_name, 'bar.txt')

<p>The solution Hans Sjunnesson provided is also off, because <code>copyfileobj</code> only copies from file-like object to file-like object, not file name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Copy the contents of the file-like object fsrc to the file-like object fdst. The integer length, if given, is the buffer size. In particular, a negative length value means to copy the data without looping over the source data in chunks; by default the data is read in chunks to avoid uncontrolled memory consumption. Note that if the current file position of the fsrc object is not 0, only the contents from the current file position to the end of the file will be copied.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>FileType</code> factory creates objects that can be passed to the type argument of <code>ArgumentParser.add_argument()</code>. Arguments that have <code>FileType</code> objects as their type will open command-line arguments […] <code>FileType</code> objects understand the pseudo-argument '-' and automatically convert this into sys.stdin for readable <code>FileType</code> objects and <code>sys.stdout</code> for writable <code>FileType</code> objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my advice is to simply use</p>

<pre><code>import sys
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('file', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
    help=""Specifies the input file"")
parser.add_argument('output', type=argparse.FileType('w'),
    help=""Specifies the output file"")
args = parser.parse_args(sys.argv[1:])

# Here you can use your files
text = args.file.read()
args.output.write(text)
# … and so on
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can do  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; python spam.py file output 
</code></pre>

<p>To read from <code>file</code> and output to <code>output</code>, or  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; echo ""Ni!"" | python spam.py - output  
</code></pre>

<p>to read <code>""Ni!""</code> and output to <code>output</code>, or</p>

<pre><code>&gt; python spam.py file -
</code></pre>

<p>…</p>

<p>And it's good, since using <code>-</code> for the relevant stream <a href=""https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/16364""> is a convention that a lot of programs use</a>. If you want to point it out, add it to the <code>help</code> strings.</p>

<pre><code>  parser.add_argument('file', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
    help=""Specifies the input file, '-' for standard input"")
</code></pre>

<p>For reference, the usage message will be</p>

<pre><code>&gt; python spam.py -h
usage: [-h] file output

positional arguments:
  file        Specifies the input file, '-' for standard input
  output      Specifies the output file, '-' for standard output

Summary: whatever you put in the [DEFAULT] section gets propagated to every other section.  Using the example from the linked website, let's say I have a config file called test1.ini:</p>

<pre><code>[host 1]
lh_server=192.168.0.1
vh_hosts = PloneSite1:8080
lh_root = PloneSite1

[host 2]
lh_server=192.168.0.1
vh_hosts = PloneSite2:8080
lh_root = PloneSite2

<p>I can read this using ConfigParser:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cp = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()
&gt;&gt;&gt; cp.read('test1.ini')
['test1.ini']
&gt;&gt;&gt; cp.get('host 1', 'lh_server')
'192.168.0.1'
</code></pre>

<p>But I notice that lh_server is the same in both sections; and, indeed, I realise that it will be the same for most hosts I might add.  So I can do this, as test2.ini:</p>

<pre><code>[DEFAULT]
lh_server=192.168.0.1

[host 1]
vh_root = PloneSite1
lh_root = PloneSite1

[host 2]
vh_root = PloneSite2
lh_root = PloneSite2

<blockquote>
  <p>This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution.</p>

<p>The intention is to make <em>all code that goes in the official python distribution</em> consistently formatted (I hope we can agree that this is universally a Good Thing™).</p>

<p>Guido was the one to choose. He didn't even have to give a reason, but he still did by referring to empirical data.</p>

<p>Basically, regardless of whether the new language is relevant to the company's current methodology, learning a new language means learning new ideas. Someone who is willing to learn a language that isn't considered ""business class"" means that he is interested in programming, beyond just earning a paycheck.</p>

<p>To quote Paul's site:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And people don't learn Python because
  it will get them a job; they learn it
  because they genuinely like to program
  and aren't satisfied with the
  languages they already know.</p>
  
  <p>Which makes them exactly the kind of
  programmers companies should want to
  hire. Hence what, for lack of a better
  name, I'll call the Python paradox: if
  a company chooses to write its
  software in a comparatively esoteric
  language, they'll be able to hire
  better programmers, because they'll
  attract only those who cared enough to
  learn it. And for programmers the
  paradox is even more pronounced: the
  language to learn, if you want to get
  a good job, is a language that people
  don't learn merely to get a job.</p>

<li>If something grossly violates this hierarchy, change the offending code. Move the code around, recode it at another place, etc. At the same time adjust the rest of your application to use this code instead of the old one. Throw the old one away if not used anymore.</li>

<p>Recently I did a large reverse-engineering job on a hideous old collection of C code.  Function by function I reallocated the features that were still relevant into classes, wrote unit tests for the classes, and built up what looked like a replacement application.  It had some of the original ""logic flow"" through the classes, and some classes were poorly designed [Mostly this was because of a subset of the global variables that was too hard to tease apart.]</p>

<p>It passed unit tests at the class level and at the overall application level.  The legacy source was mostly used as a kind of ""specification in C"" to ferret out the really obscure business rules.</p>

<p>Last year, I wrote a project plan for replacing 30-year old COBOL.  The customer was leaning toward Java.  I prototyped the revised data model in Python using Django as part of the planning effort.  I could demo the core transactions before I was done planning.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:  It was quicker to build a the model and admin interface in Django than to plan the project as a whole.</p>

<p>Because of the ""we need to use Java"" mentality, the resulting project will be larger and more expensive than finishing the Django demo.  With no real value to balance that cost.</p>

<p>Also, I did the same basic ""prototype in Django"" for a VB desktop application that needed to become a web application.  I built the model in Django, loaded legacy data, and was up and running in a few weeks.  I used that working prototype to specify the rest of the conversion effort.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:  I had a working Django implementation (model and admin pages only) that I used to plan the rest of the effort.</p>

<p>The best part about doing this kind of prototyping in Django is that you can mess around with the model, unit tests and admin pages until you get it <strong>right</strong>.    Once the model's right, you can spend the rest of your time fiddling around with the user interface until everyone's happy.</p>

"84943","2","84340","<p>A lot of times some quick task comes up that isn't part of the main software you are developing.  Sometimes the task is one off ie compare this file to the database and let me know the differences.  It is a lot easier to do text parsing in Perl/Ruby/Python than it is in Java or C# (partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions).  It will probably take a lot less time to parse the text file using Perl/Ruby/Python (or maybe even vbscript <em>cringe</em> and then load it into the database than it would to create a Java/C# program to do it or to do it by hand.</p>

<p>Also, due to the ease at which most of the dynamic languages parse text, they are great for code generation.  Sure your final project must be in C#/Java/Transact SQL but instead of cutting and pasting 100 times, finding errors, and cutting and pasting another 100 times it is often (but not always) easier just to use a code generator.</p>

<p>A recent example at work is we needed to get data from one accounting system into our accounting system.  The system has an import format, but the old system had a completely different format (fixed width although some things had to be matched).  The task is not to create a program to migrate the data over and over again.  It is to shove the data into our system and then maintain it there going forward.  So even though we are a C# and SQL Server shop, I used Python to convert the data into the format that could be imported by our application.  Ultimately it doesn't matter that I used python, it matters that the data is in the system.  My boss was pretty impressed.</p>

<p>Where I often see the dynamic languages used for is testing.  It is much easier to create a Python/Perl/Ruby program to link to a web service and throw some data against it than it is to create the equivalent Java program.  You can also use python to hit against command line programs, generate a ton of garbage (but still valid) test data, etc.. quite easily.</p>

<p>The other thing that dynamic languages are big on is code generation.  Creating the C#/C++/Java code.  Some examples follow:</p>

<p>The first code generation task I often see is people using dynamic languages to maintain constants in the system.  Instead of hand coding a bunch of enums, a dynamic language can be used to fairly easily parse a text file and create the Java/C# code with the enums.</p>

<p>SQL is a whole other ball game but often you get better performance by cut and pasting 100 times instead of trying to do a function (due to caching of execution plans or putting complicated logic in a function causing you to go row by row instead of in a set).  In fact it is quite useful to use the table definition to create certain stored procedures automatically.</p>

<p>It is always better to get buy in for a code generator.  But even if you don't, is it more fun to spend time cutting/pasting or is it more fun to create a Perl/Python/Ruby script once and then have that generate the code?  If it takes you hours to hand code something but less time to create a code generator, then even if you use it once you have saved time and hence money.  If it takes you longer to create a code generator than it takes to hand code once but you know you will have to update the code more than once, it may still make sense.  If it takes you 2 hours to hand code, 4 hours to do the generator but you know you'll have to hand code equivalent work another 5 or 6 times than it is obviously better to create the generator.</p>

<p>Also some things are easier with dynamic languages than Java/C#/C/C++.  In particular regular expressions come to mind.  If you start using regular expressions in Perl and realize their value, you may suddenly start making use of the Java regular expression library if you haven't before.  If you have then there may be something else.</p>

<p>I will leave you with one last example of a task that would have been great for a dynamic language.  My work mate had to take a directory full of files and burn them to various cd's for various customers.  There were a few customers but a lot of files and you had to look in them to see what they were.  He did this task by hand....A Java/C# program would have saved time, but for one time and with all the development overhead it isn't worth it.  However slapping something together in Perl/Python/Ruby probably would have been worth it.  He spent several hours doing it.  It would have taken less than one to create the Python script to inspect each file, match which customer it goes to, and then move the file to the appropriate place.....Again, not part of the standard job.  But the task came up as a one off.  Is it better to do it yourself, spend the larger amount of time to make Java/C# do the task, or spend a much smaller amount of time doing it in Python/Perl/Ruby.  If you are using C or C++ the point is even more dramatic due to the extra concerns of programming in C or C++ (pointers, no array bounds checking, etc.).</p>

<p>You also have the benefit that exposing yourself to additional languages broadens your abilities and learning to attack problems from a different languages perspective can be as valuable as the language itself.</p>

<p>Finally, scripting languages are very useful in the realm of extension. Take LUA as an example. You can bolt a lua interpreter into your app with very little overhead and you now have a way to create rich scripting functionality that can be exposed to end users or altered and distributed quickly without requiring a rebuild of the entire app. This is used to great effect in many games most notably World of Warcraft.</p>

"84337","2","83983","<p>there is some good info below on why certain things are functions and other are methods.  It does indeed cause some inconsistencies in the language.</p>

"84155","2","83983","<p>The short answer: 1) backwards compatibility and 2) there's not enough of a difference for it to really matter.  For a more detailed explanation, read on.</p>

<p>The idiomatic Python approach to such operations is special methods which aren't intended to be called directly.  For example, to make <code>x + y</code> work for your own class, you write a <code>__add__</code> method.  To make sure that <code>int(spam)</code> properly converts your custom class, write a <code>__int__</code> method.  To make sure that <code>len(foo)</code> does something sensible, write a <code>__len__</code> method.</p>

<p>This is how things have always been with Python, and I think it makes a lot of sense for some things.  In particular, this seems like a sensible way to implement operator overloading.  As for the rest, different languages disagree; in Ruby you'd convert something to an integer by calling <code>spam.to_i</code> directly instead of saying <code>int(spam)</code>.</p>

<p>You're right that Python is an extremely object-oriented language and that having to call an external function on an object to get its length seems odd.  On the other hand, <code>len(silly_walks)</code> isn't any more onerous than <code>silly_walks.len()</code>, and Guido has said that he actually prefers it (<a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First of all, I chose len(x) over x.len() for HCI reasons (def __len__() came much later). There are two intertwined reasons actually, both HCI:</p>
  
  <p>(a) For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than postfix — prefix (and infix!) operations have a long tradition in mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which we rewrite a formula like x*(a+b) into x<em>a + x</em>b to the clumsiness of doing the same thing using a raw OO notation.</p>
  
  <p>(b) When I read code that says len(x) I know that it is asking for the length of something. This tells me two things: the result is an integer, and the argument is some kind of container. To the contrary, when I read x.len(), I have to already know that x is some kind of container implementing an interface or inheriting from a class that has a standard len(). Witness the confusion we occasionally have when a class that is not implementing a mapping has a get() or keys() method, or something that isn’t a file has a write() method.</p>
  
  <p>Saying the same thing in another way, I see ‘len‘ as a built-in operation. I’d hate to lose that. /…/</p>

<p>I don't think query round trip time should be very high as i'm running the the queries on the same machine that runs Postgres, so it can't add much latency?</p>

<p>I've also done some checking into the cache sizes, and it seems Postgres relies on the OS to handle caching, they specifically mention BSD as the ideal OS for this, so I thinking Mac OS ought to be pretty smart about bringing the table into memory.  Unless someone has more specific params in mind I think more specific caching is out of my control.</p>

<p>In the end I can probably put up with 200 ms response times, but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied, as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks.</p>

<p>I'd consider 200ms for something like this to be pretty good, A quick test on my oracle server, the same table structure with about 500k rows and no indexes, takes about 1 - 1.5 seconds, which is almost all just oracle sucking the data off disk.</p>

<p>The real question is, is 200ms fast enough?</p>

<p>-------------- More --------------------</p>

<p>I was interested in solving this using materialized views, since I've never really played with them. This is in oracle.</p>

<p>First I created a MV which refreshes every minute.</p>

<pre><code>create materialized view mv_so_x 
build immediate 
refresh complete 
START WITH SYSDATE NEXT SYSDATE + 1/24/60
 as select count(*),avg(a),avg(b),avg(c),avg(d) from so_x;
</code></pre>

<p>While its refreshing, there is no rows returned</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; select * from mv_so_x;

no rows selected

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
</code></pre>

<p>Once it refreshes, its MUCH faster than doing the raw query</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; select count(*),avg(a),avg(b),avg(c),avg(d) from so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:05.74
SQL&gt; select * from mv_so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>If we insert into the base table, the result is not immediately viewable view the MV.</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; insert into so_x values (1,2,3,4,5);

1 row created.

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; commit;

Commit complete.

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; select * from mv_so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>But wait a minute or so, and the MV will update behind the scenes, and the result is returned fast as you could want.</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; /

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899460 7495.35823 22.2905352 5.00276078 2.17647059

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't ideal. for a start, its not realtime, inserts/updates will not be immediately visible. Also, you've got a query running to update the MV whether you need it or not (this can be tune to whatever time frame, or on demand). But, this does show how much faster an MV can make it seem to the end user, if you can live with values which aren't quite upto the second accurate.</p>

"51976","2","51553","<p>You need to increase postgres' caches to the point where the whole working set fits into memory before you can expect to see perfomance comparable to doing it in-memory with a program.</p>
",""
"51933","2","51553","<p>Those are very detailed answers, but they mostly beg the question, how do I get these benefits without leaving Postgres given that the data easily fits into memory, requires concurrent reads but no writes and is queried with the same query over and over again.</p>

<p>Is it possible to precompile the query and optimization plan? I would have thought the stored procedure would do this, but it doesn't really help.</p>

<p>To avoid disk access it's necessary to cache the whole table in memory, can I force Postgres to do that?  I think it's already doing this though, since the query executes in just 200 ms after repeated runs.</p>

<p>Can I tell Postgres that the table is read only, so it can optimize any locking code?</p>

<p>I think it's possible to estimate the query construction costs with an empty table (timings range from 20-60 ms) </p>

<p>I still can't see why the Java/Python tests are invalid.  Postgres just isn't doing that much more work (though I still haven't addressed the concurrency aspect, just the caching and query construction)</p>

<p>UPDATE: 
I don't think it's fair to compare the SELECTS as suggested by pulling 350,000 through the driver and serialization steps into Python to run the aggregation, nor even to omit the aggregation as the overhead in formatting and displaying is hard to separate from the timing.  If both engines are operating on in memory data, it should be an apples to apples comparison, I'm not sure how to guarantee that's already happening though.</p>

",""
"51817","2","51553","<p>One other thing that an RDBMS generally does for you is to provide concurrency by protecting you from simultaneous access by another process.  This is done by placing locks, and there's some overhead from that.</p>

<p>If you're dealing with entirely static data that never changes, and especially if you're in a basically ""single user"" scenario, then using a relational database doesn't necessarily gain you much benefit.</p>
",""
"51745","2","51553","<p>I would say your test scheme is not really useful. To fulfill the db query, the db server goes through several steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>parse the SQL</li>
<li>work up a query plan, i. e. decide on which indices to use (if any), optimize etc.</li>
<li>if an index is used, search it for the pointers to the actual data, then go to the appropriate location in the data or</li>
<li>if no index is used, scan <i>the whole table</i> to determine which rows are needed</li>
<li>load the data from disk into a temporary location (hopefully, but not necessarily, memory)</li>
<li>perform the count() and avg() calculations</li>
</ol>

<p>So, creating an array in Python and getting the average basically skips all these steps save the last one. As disk I/O is among the most expensive operations a program has to perform, this is a major flaw in the test (see also the answers to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26021/how-is-data-compression-more-effective-than-indexing-for-search-performance"">this question</a> I asked here before). Even if you read the data from disk in your other test, the process is completely different and it's hard to tell how relevant the results are.</p>

<p>To obtain more information about where Postgres spends its time, I would suggest the following tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compare the execution time of your query to a SELECT without the aggregating functions (i. e. cut step 5)</li>
<li>If you find that the aggregation leads to a significant slowdown, try if Python does it faster, obtaining the raw data through the plain SELECT from the comparison.</li>
</ul>

<p>To speed up your query, reduce disk access first. I doubt very much that it's the aggregation that takes the time.</p>

<p>There's several ways to do that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cache data (in memory!) for subsequent access, either via the db engine's own capabilities or with tools like memcached</li>
<li>Reduce the size of your stored data</li>
<li>Optimize the use of indices. Sometimes this can mean to skip index use altogether (after all, it's disk access, too). For MySQL, I seem to remember that it's recommended to skip indices if you assume that the query fetches more than 10% of all the data in the table.</li>
<li>If your query makes good use of indices, I know that for MySQL databases it helps to put indices and data on separate physical disks. However, I don't know whether that's applicable for Postgres.</li>
<li>There also might be more sophisticated problems such as swapping rows to disk if for some reason the result set can't be completely processed in memory. But I would leave that kind of research until I run into serious performance problems that I can't find another way to fix, as it requires knowledge about a lot of little under-the-hood details in your process.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Update:</b></p>

<p><i>I just realized that you seem to have no use for indices for the above query and most likely aren't using any, too, so my advice on indices probably wasn't helpful. Sorry. Still, I'd say that the aggregation is not the problem but disk access is. I'll leave the index stuff in, anyway, it might still have some use.</i></p>

<h2>Performance and Scalability</h2>

<p>Choice of session store has an effect on performance and scalability. This should only be a big problem if you have a very popular application.</p>

<p>Both database and filesystem session stores are (usually) backed by disks so you can have a lot of sessions cheaply (because disks are cheap), but requests will often have to wait for the data to be read (because disks are slow). Memcached sessions use RAM, so will cost more to support the same number of concurrent sessions (because RAM is expensive), but may be faster (because RAM is fast).</p>

<p>Filesystem sessions are tied to the box where your application is running, so you can't load balance between multiple application servers if your site gets huge. Database and memcached sessions let you have multiple application servers talking to a shared session store.</p>

<h2>Simplicity</h2>

<p>Choice of session store will also impact how easy it is to deploy your site. Changing away from the default will cost some complexity. Memcached and RDBMSs both have their own complexities, but your application is probably going to be using an RDBMS anyway.</p>

<p>Unless you have a very popular application, simplicity should be the larger concern.</p>

<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>Another approach is to store <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/sessions/#using-cookie-based-sessions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">session data in cookies</a> (all of it, not just an ID). This has the advantage that the session store automatically scales with the number of users, but it has disadvantages too. You (or your framework) need to be careful to stop users forging session data. You also need to keep each session small because the whole thing will be sent with every request.</p>

"22219","2","21934","<p>Darren Thomas gives a good answer.  However, one big difference between the Java and Python approaches is that with reference counting in the common case (no circular references) objects are cleaned up immediately rather than at some indeterminate later date.</p>

<p>For example, I can write sloppy, non-portable code in CPython such as</p>

<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):
    return open(fname).read().split(""~~~"")[2:4]
</code></pre>

<p>and the file descriptor for that file I opened will be cleaned up immediately because as soon as the reference to the open file goes away, the file is garbage collected and the file descriptor is freed.  Of course, if I run Jython or IronPython or possibly PyPy, then the garbage collector won't necessarily run until much later; possibly I'll run out of file descriptors first and my program will crash.</p>

<p>So you SHOULD be writing code that looks like</p>

<pre><code>def parse_some_attrs(fname):
    with open(fname) as f:
        return f.read().split(""~~~"")[2:4]
</code></pre>

<p>but sometimes people like to rely on reference counting to always free up their resources because it can sometimes make your code a little shorter.</p>

<p>I'd say that the best garbage collector is the one with the best performance, which currently seems to be the Java-style generational garbage collectors that can run in a separate thread and has all these crazy optimizations, etc.  The differences to how you write your code should be negligible and ideally non-existent.</p>

If you did a strlen it will also give the correct result. As an example if you did string count on Hello, you will get 5 (even if it's Unicode).

"21964","2","21934","<p>There are drawbacks of using reference counting. One of the most mentioned is circular references: Suppose A references B, B references C and C references B.

CPython (reference counting is not part of python itself, but part of the C implementation thereof) catches circular references with a separate garbage collection routine that it runs periodically...</p>

<p>Another drawback: Reference counting can make execution slower. Each time an object is referenced and dereferenced, the interpreter/VM must check to see if the count has gone down to 0 (and then deallocate if it did). Garbage Collection does not need to do this.</p>

<p>Also, Garbage Collection can be done in a separate thread (though it can be a bit tricky). On machines with lots of RAM and for processes that use memory only slowly, you might not want to be doing GC at all! Reference counting would be a bit of a drawback there in terms of performance...</p>

<p>In <code>get_score()</code> you could add an else clause to handle any ties that happen and you wouldn't have to check for it explicitly in <code>play_game()</code></p>

<p>Move the <code>import random</code> to the top of the file. imports are generally always found at the top of the file. Also, there's no need to re-import every time you want a random number.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is a typo, cause <code>play</code> seems to always hold an integer, but you have <code>play == True</code> and <code>play == False</code> inside <code>play_game()</code>. If you want to make <code>play</code> contain either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, you need to be using a single equals sign, eg, <code>play = True</code>. But this doesn't seem to make sense because you're comparing <code>play</code> to <code>computer</code> as if they're integers.</p>

<p>Also, what are you trying to accomplish with the <code>score</code> variable in the <code>get_score()</code> method?</p>

<p>Ah, if you made the <code>get_score()</code> method return something so you know who won the match it would be helpful. You can't access <code>computer_wins</code> or <code>player_wins</code> inside the <code>get_score()</code> method because they were defined inside <code>main()</code>. A simple way to do this is return an int from <code>get_score()</code>. here is a rather C-style way of handling it (returning -1/0/1). something like (pseudo code):</p>

  score = 0

      score = -1
  elif player wins:
      score = 1

"7863548","2","7863471","<p>There's so much wrong with this, it's hard to know where to start (but don't get discouraged)... </p>

<p>First of all, it looks like (mostly from your use of <code>input</code> vs. <code>raw_input</code> and your parens with your print statements) you're using Python 3, which already is going to limit the amount of help you get.  Most people are still using Python 2.6 or 2.7.  But with that out of the way...</p>

<p>The main remaining issues addressing your question are:</p>

<p>First: you're using strings for player input (e.g. '1', '2', '3'), and numbers for computer choice (e.g. 1, 2, 3).  So you need to compare them as such.  In other words, instead of:</p>

<pre><code>if computer == 1 and play == 2:
</code></pre>

<p>You would need to say:</p>

<pre><code>if computer == 1 and play == '2':
</code></pre>

<p>Second: you're trying to reference one function's variables in another one, and that won't work.  If you want your <code>computer_wins</code>, etc. variables to be global, you need to initialize them at the global scope, e.g. right after your ""#constants"" are declared and before you get into <code>main</code>.  Then in any function that uses them, you must say e.g. <code>global computer_wins</code> to indicate they are global and not local.</p>

<p>Once you get these issues addressed, it should work a bit better, but you'll still need to do a lot of cleanup and keep working on it!  </p>

<p>Keep at it, and soon it will be natural for you.</p>

<p>This is because <strong>f</strong> and <strong>g</strong> are actually <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/types.html?highlight=lambda#types.LambdaType"" rel=""nofollow"">LambdaTypes</a>, and the () operator calls them, allowing the + operator to add their return values.

<p>The house is just several rooms. A room is just 4 walls, a floor and a ceiling. A wall is just several boards, and a board is 2x4.  Once you break all the parts down, then you'll know not only what you need to make, but what you need to find for each piece.</p>

<p>You've got a good start with your list of requirements. That defines what you want your program to do. Now you need to work backwards to define the different parts. <strong>Don't</strong> get hung up on <em>how</em> they work, define the way they mesh.</p>

<pre><code>image[c:c+3], image[-c-3: -c] = image[-c-3: -c], image[c:c+3]
</code></pre>

<p>You are changing the <code>image</code> variable in-place, but you seemed to forget the row variable <code>r</code>. So right now, you are changing rows. And your negative slicing is a bit off. For <code>c=0</code>, you'll get <code>image[-3:0]</code> and this is not a valid slice and it will return <code>[]</code>.</p>

<p>But judging from your code you don't mean to change <code>image</code> in-place, you rather want to create <code>new_image</code>. What you should be doing is inserting slices at the end of <code>new_row</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def horizontal_flip(image):
    rows = len(image)
    cols = len(image[0])
    new_image = []
    for r in range(rows):
        new_row = []
        for c in range(0,cols,3):
            new_row = image[r][c:c+3] + new_row
        new_image.append(new_row)
    return new_image
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, you can also change the <code>image</code> in-place, but be careful. As you are passing a <code>list</code>, you should copy it before changing so that original is unchanged. Here is that version:</p>

<pre><code>def horizontal_flip(image):
    cols = len(image[0])/3

    #make a copy so that original image is not altered
    image = [row[:] for row in image]

    for row in image:
        for c in range(int(cols/2)): # int() is not needed for Python 2.x, since integer division yields integer
                                     # This also takes care of odd n cases, middle chunk is not changed.
            row[3*c:3*c+3], row[3*(cols-c-1):3*(cols-c-1)+3] = row[3*(cols-c-1):3*(cols-c-1)+3], row[3*c:3*c+3]

    return image
</code></pre>

<p>This can also be done with a list comprehension in single line, but it will be less readable. If you like, here is how you can do it:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain

<p>Update: Base64 encoding produces 4 output bytes for every 3 input bytes. Your base64 code doesn't work with 56-byte chunks because 56 is not an integral multiple of 3; each chunk is padded out to a multiple of 3.

"7884352","2","7840811","<p>In step 1, you're iterating over a query object. This results in one fetch RPC per 20 objects returned, which is inefficient, time-wise. Instead, call <code>fetch(n)</code> on the Query object, where <code>n</code> is the maximum number of results to return - this does only a single RPC. It also has the benefit of limiting the number of results to search - right now, if I search for 'I', your app will get stuck processing nearly every record in step 1.</p>

<p>It's also completely unnecessary to convert the keys into strings - you can add keys to a set just fine.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, though, I personally find 'or' searches to be particularly useless. I realise you'll rank items that match all the terms first, but those will inevitably be followed by piles and piles of irrelevant results.

"7838818","2","7821669","<p>You need to use equations 7 through 9 in combination. The only things that are unknown in the equations are the Lagrange multipliers, the lambdas. Everything else depends on the empirical data available, and are thus just numbers. </p>

<p>Given a set of values for the lambdas, you can calculate the G(j,r) and the Jacobian J(j,i,r,s). In turn, if you know the residuals and the Jacobian, you can use Newton's method, given in equation 9, to find the roots of the system of equations, i.e., those values of lambda such that G(j,r) = 0. </p>

<p>Thus, you use an initial guess at the values for the lambdas to calculate the other terms, then use those terms to update your guess. There's no conceptual challenge to working with equation 7 and 8 at all -- just plug in the values -- but they are adding up a lot of numbers, so some care is warranted.</p>

<p>Equation 9 is a little tricky, as it's not written very clearly. Since the paper describes a system of equations, you'd generally expect to solve a linear equation:</p>

<pre><code>J * d_lambda = -G
</code></pre>

<p>where d_lambda is a vector of changes in the guess, G is a vector of values for the function, and J is a matrix of Jacobian values. The notation in the paper is pretty muddled, obscuring what should be a simple expression. You can get it into a clearer form by introducing a unified index <em>a</em> to replace the pair of indices <em>i</em> and <em>s</em>; the authors mention just this change in the discussion of the method, giving a formula for calculating the combined index in the second paragraph on page 4.</p>

<p>Overall, the procedure becomes (using the unified index):</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose some lambdas to  act as your initial guess. Maybe zeros, or random numbers.</li>
<li>Evaluate G(a) and J(a,b).</li>
<li>Solve a system of linear equations to get the updates to your guess.</li>
<li>If the updates are small compared to your guess, stop. Otherwise, determine the new guess and go back to step 2.</li>

<p>It seems to me that perhaps jobs is a container of dictionaries, which have a key 'Job_Name', and that key's value is a list or tuple. I think what you might mean is:</p>

<p>4 - Your regex could be simplified by using a <strong>raw</strong> string to eliminate all the double escapes: <code>p=re.compile(r""(\w*):?\w*-?\d*"")</code> </p>

<p>5 - Your whole regex may be unnecessary. If you're doing what I think you're doing, you just want what appears before the first colon, if there is one.

<ul>
<li>It does not support filenames that repeat.  Any filename that occurs in the ""old"" history will not be detected as a new file.  Maybe this is a problem for you, maybe not.  But even if filenames are guaranteed unique now, that may not always be true.</li>
<li>It does not tell you whether a new file is ready to be consumed or not.  It is possible that a new file will be processed while it is still being uploaded.  Some people apply a ""no change in size for X seconds"" rule, but that just increases delay and still leaves a vulnerability to severed connections.</li>

<p>One scheme that is similar but does not have either of these two problems is to actually store a file on the server with a reserved name, or in a separate place, and use its timestamp (preferably the modification time of the file itself) to decide which files can be safely processed.  This ""semaphore"" file is updated to the current time as the last step in uploading a file.  All files with a modification time older than the semaphore timestamp can be processed.  Once processed, all files must be deleted out of the upload folder so they won't be processed twice.  I have seen this scheme work well in an automated production data flow.</p>

"15076562","2","120926","<p>Besides all the other reasons already named (consistency, never mixing spaces and tabs etc) I believe there are a few more reasons for the 4 spaces convention to note. These only apply to Python (and maybe other languages where indentation has meaning). Tabs may be nicer in other languages, depending on individual preferences.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If an editor doesn't show tabs (which happens, depending on the configuration, in quite a few), another author might assume that your code uses 4 spaces, b/c almost all of the Python code being publicly available does; if that same editor happens to have a tab width of 4, nasty things may happen - at least, that poor person will lose time over an indentation issue that would have been very easy to avoid by sticking to the convention. So for me, the number one reason is to avoid bugs with consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>Reframing the question of which is better, tabs or spaces, one should ask which the advantages of tabs are; I've seen plenty posts praising tabs, but few compelling arguments for them; good editors like emacs, vi(m), kate, ... do proper indentation depending on the semantics of your code - even without tabs; the same editors can easily be configured to unindent on backspace etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Some people have very strong preferences when it comes to their freedom in deciding the look/ layout of code; others value consistency over this freedom. Python drastically reduces this freedom by dictating that indentation is used for blocks etc. This may be seen as a bug or a feature, but it sort of comes with choosing Python. Personally, I like this consistency - when starting to code on a new project, at least the layout is close to what I'm used to, so it's fairly easy to read. Almost always.</p></li>
<li><p>Using spaces for indentation allows ""layout tricks"" that may facilitate to comprehend code; some examples of these are listed in PEP8; eg.</p>

<pre><code>foo = long_function_name(var_one, var_two,
                         var_three, var_four)

# the same for lists
a_long_list = [1,
               2,
               # ...
               79]

# or dictionaries
a_dict = {""a_key"": ""a_value"",
          ""another_key"": ""another_value""}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, the above can also be written nicely as</p>

<pre><code>foo = long_function_name(
    var_one, var_two,
    var_three, var_four)

# the same for lists
a_long_list = [
    1,
    2,
    # ...
    79]

# or dictionaries
a_dict = {
    ""a_key"": ""a_value"",
    ""another_key"": ""another_value""}
</code></pre>

<p>However, the latter takes more lines of code and less lines are sometimes argued to be better (b/c you get more on a single screen). But if you like alignment, spaces (preferably assisted by a good editor) give you, in a sense, more freedom in Python than tabs. [Well, I guess some editors allow you to do the same w/ tabs ;) - but with spaces, all of them do...]</p></li>
<li><p>Coming back to the same argument that everybody else makes - PEP 8 dictates (ok, strongly recommends) spaces. If coming to a project that uses tabs only, of course, you have little choice. But because of the establishment of the PEP 8 conventions, almost all Python programmers are used to this style. This makes it sooooo much easier to find a consensus on a style that is accepted by most programmers... and having individuals agree on style might be very hard otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Tools that help enforcing style are usually aware of PEP 8 without extra effort. That's not a great reason, but it's just nice to have things work ~out of the box.</p></li>

The annoying edge case is that if you want to store stuff like '2nd Monday of the month', you have to do additional work with MO(2), because the value it returns isn't useful. It's hard to explain, but you'll see the problem when you try it.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any efficient way to find all eligible events within a range though, you'll have to load in all the Event models that potentially overlap with the range. So you'll always be loading in potentially more data than you'll eventually use. Just make sure relatively smart about it to reduce the burden. Short of someone adding recurrence handling to databases themselves, I'm not aware of any way to improve this.</p>

"15688085","2","15679719","<p>You are basically reinventing the indexing scheme of a multidimensional array. It is relatively easy to code, but you can use the two functions <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.unravel_index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>unravel_index</code></a> and <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ravel_multi_index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ravel_multi_index</code></a> to your advantage here.</p>

<p>If your grid is of <code>M</code> rows and <code>N</code> columns, to get the <code>idx</code> and <code>idy</code> of a single item you could do:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; M, N = 12, 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.unravel_index(4, dims=(M, N))
(0, 4)
</code></pre>

<p>This also works if, instead of a single index, you provide an array of indices:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; np.unravel_index([15, 28, 32, 97], dims=(M, N))
(array([1, 2, 3, 9], dtype=int64), array([5, 8, 2, 7], dtype=int64))
</code></pre>

<p>So if <code>cells</code> has the indices of several cells you want to find neighbors to:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cells = np.array([15, 28, 32, 44, 87])
</code></pre>

<p>You can get their neighbors as:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; idy, idx = np.unravel_index(cells, dims=(M, N))
&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_idx = np.vstack((idx-1, idx+1, idx, idx))
&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_idy = np.vstack((idy, idy, idy-1, idy+1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.ravel_multi_index((neigh_idy, neigh_idx), dims=(M,N))

"15688667","2","15684842","<p>Assignment itself does nothing. <code>rc</code> here is your client. Doing <code>rc[0]</code>, or any sort of indexing, generates and returns a DirectView object that's a view with whatever engines you specify in []. This is a shorthand for generating the views: it's not actually just getting a specific object.</p>

<p>Thus, those views aren't unique. The best way to explain it, I think, is with an example. Say you have 2 engines. You want to run some tasks on only engine one, and want the tasks to block. You want to run others on only engine one, but don't want them to block. You want to run yet more on engines 1 and 2, and don't want them to block. Then you could do:</p>

<pre><code>view_1_block = rc[0]
view_1_block.block = True
view_2_noblock = rc[0]
view_2_noblock.block = False
view_3_noblock = rc[[0,1]]
view_3_noblock.block = False
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can use these to run tasks in whatever way you'd like, eg</p>

<pre><code>view_1_block.map(lambda x:x**10, range(32)) # blocks, returns results, runs only on 1
view_3_noblock.map(lambda x:x**10, range(32)) # does not block, returns AsyncResult, runs on 1 and 2
</code></pre>

<p>There's no actual magic being used here. When you run rc[0] twice, it generates two views. The second view is not the same as the first. When you assign rc[0] to a variable, and then use that variable, you're working with one view, and not creating a new one. </p>

<p>iPython, like Numpy and Scipy, has quite a few shorthand notations that don't necessarily fit Python's idioms perfectly. This is especially the case with [] and getitem. A purer Python way of writing this could would be to use the much more unwieldy <code>rc.direct_view(1)</code>, and so on, which would make clear that this wasn't just getting an item, and was actually creating a view.</p>

"15742314","2","15740689","<p>All classifiers in scikit-learn(*) expect a flat feature representation for samples, so you'll probably want to turn your <code>string</code> feature into a vector. First, let get some incorrect assumptions out of the way:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>DictVectorizer</code> is not for handling ""lines of text"", but for arbitrary symbolic features.</li>
<li><code>CountVectorizer</code> is also not for handling lines, but for entire text documents.</li>
<li>Whether features are ""equal in importance"" is mostly up to the learning algorithm, though with a kernelized SVM, you can assign artificially small weights to features to make its dot products come out differently. I'm not saying that's a good idea, though.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two ways of handling this kind of data:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build a <code>FeatureUnion</code> consisting of a <code>CountVectorizer</code> (or <code>TfidfVectorizer</code>) for your textual data and a <code>DictVectorizer</code> for the additional features.</li>
<li><p>Manually split the textual data into words, then use each word as a feature in a <code>DictVectorizer</code>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>{""string:some"": True, ""string:arbitrary"": True, ""string:text"": True,
 ""label1"": ""orange"", ""value1"" : False }
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Then the related questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>might this data structure indicate which SVM kernel is best?</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you're handling textual data, try a <code>LinearSVC</code> first and a polynomial kernel of degree 2 if it doesn't work. RBF kernels are a bad match for textual data, and cubic or higher-order poly kernels tend to overfit badly. As an alternative to kernels, you can manually construct products of individual features and train a <code>LinearSVC</code> on that; sometimes, that works better than a kernel. It also gets rid of the feature importances issue as a <code>LinearSVC</code> learns per-feature weights.</p>

<ul>
<li>Or would a Random Forest/Decision Tree, DBN, or Bayes classifier possibly do better in this case?</li>
</ul>

<p>That's impossible to tell without trying. scikit-learn's random forests and dtrees unfortunately don't handle sparse matrices, so they're rather hard to apply. DBNs are not implemented.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I be using feature selection?</li>

"15774990","2","15699566","<p>The cleanest solution would be inotify in many ways - this is more or less exactly what it's intended for, after all. If the log file was changing extremely rapidly then you could potentially risk being woken up almost constantly, which wouldn't necessarily be particularly efficient - however, you could always mitigate this by adding a short delay of your own after the inotify filehandle returns an event. In practice I doubt this would be an issue on most systems, but I thought it worth mentioning in case your system is very tight on CPU resources.</p>

<p>I can't see how the <code>sleep()</code> approach would miss file updates except in cases where the file is truncated or rotated (i.e. renamed and another file of the same name created). These are tricky cases to handle however you do things, and you can use tricks like periodically re-opening the file by name to check for rotation. Read the <code>tail</code> man page because it handles many such cases, and they're going to be quite common for log files in particular (log rotation being widely considered to be good practice).</p>

<p>The downside of <code>sleep()</code> is of course that you'd end up batching up your reads with delays in between, and also that you have the overhead of constantly waking up and polling the file even when it's not changing. If you did this, say, once per second, however, the overhead probably isn't noticeable on most systems.</p>

<p>I'd say inotify is the best choice unless you want to remain compatible, in which case the simple fallback using <code>sleep()</code> is still quite reasonable.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I just realised I forgot to mention - an easy way to check for a file being renamed is to perform an <code>os.fstat(fd.fileno())</code> on your open filehandle and a <code>os.stat()</code> on the filename you opened and compare the results. If the <code>os.stat()</code> fails then the error will tell you if the file's been deleted, and if not then comparing the <code>st_ino</code> (the inode number) fields will tell you if the file's been deleted and then replaced with a new one of the same name.</p>

<p>Detecting truncation is harder - effectively your read pointer remains at the same offset in the file and reading will return nothing until the file content size gets back to where you were - then the file will read from that point as normal. If you call <code>os.stat()</code> frequently you could check for the file size going backwards - alternatively you could use <code>fd.tell()</code> to record your current position in the file and then perform an explicit seek to the end of the file and call <code>fd.tell()</code> again. If the value is lower, then the file's been truncated under you. This is a safe operation as long as you keep the original file position around because you can always seek back to it after the check.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you're using inotify anyway, you could just watch the parent directory for changes.</p>

<p>Note that files can be truncated to non-zero sizes, but I doubt that's likely to happen to a log file - the common cases will be being deleted and replaced, or truncated to zero. Also, I don't know how you'd detect the case that the file was truncated and then immediately filled back up to beyond your current position, except by remembering the most recent N characters and comparing them, but that's a pretty grotty thing to do. I think inotify will just tell you the file has been modified in that case.</p>

"20024051","2","15680463","<p><strong>A neat trick for those using IPython in windows</strong> is that you can make an ipython icon in each of your project directories designed to open with the notebook pointing at that chosen project. This helps keep things separate.</p>

<p>For example if you have a new project in C:\fake\example\directory</p>

<p>Copy an ipython notebook icon to the directory or create a new link to the windows ""cmd"" shell. Then right click on the icon and ""Edit Properties""</p>

<p>Set the shortcut properties to:</p>

<pre><code>Target:
C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k ""cd C:\fake\example\directory &amp; C: &amp; ipython notebook --pylab inline""

Start in:
C:\fake\example\directory\

<p>(Note the added slash at the end of ""start in"")</p>

<p>This runs windows command line, changes to your working directory, and runs the ipython notebook pointed at that directory.</p>

<p>Drop one of these in each project folder and you'll have ipython notebook groups kept nice and separate while still just a doubleclick away.</p>

<p>UPDATE: IPython has removed support for the command line inlining of pylab so the fix for that with this trick is to just eliminate ""--pylab inline"" if you have a newer IPython version (or just don't want pylab obviously).</p>

<p>UPDATE FOR JUPYTER NOTEBOOK ~ version 4.1.1</p>

<p>On my test machines and as reported in comments below, the newest jupyter build appears to check the start directory and launch with that as the working directory. This means that the working directory override is not needed.</p>

    jupyter notebook

Target (if jupyter notebook NOT in path):
    C:\Users\&lt;Your Username Here&gt;\Anaconda\Scripts\jupyter.exe notebook

<p>If jupyter notebook is not in your PATH you just need to add the full directory reference in front of the command. If that doesn't work please try working from the earlier version. Very conveniently, now ""Start in:"" can be empty in my tests with 4.1.1 and later. Perhaps they read this entry on SO and liked it, so long upvotes, nobody needs this anymore :)</p>

<p>The program is probably stuck in the <code>while True:</code> cycle infinitely, as you only break out of the cycle when <code>number &lt;= 0</code>.

<p>The problem itself is pretty easy to solve with a recursive algorithms. You would first create a dictionary in which every key would be one of the elements and every value would be a list of elements which are at most 7 apart from that element. For your example, you would have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for element in elements:
    connections[element] = []
    visited[element] = False
    for another in elements:
        if abs(element - another) &lt;= limit:

    997: [999, 1000, 1002]
    ...
    2014: []
}

<p>Now you need to write a recursive function which will take as input an element and a list, and it will keep adding elements in a list as long as it can find an element which is at most 7 apart from the current element.</p>

    if visited[element]:

    visited[element] = True
    group.append(element)
    for another in connections[element]:
        group_elements(another, group)
</code></pre>

<p>Somewhere in the code you also need to remember which elements you have already visited to make sure that you don't get into an infinite loop.</p>

<pre><code>visited = {}

<p>If you're trying to distribute your program to other users and machines, you should look into <a href=""http://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">making a distribution package</a> (see side note 3 below), and using <code>package_data</code> to include your configuration file, and <code>pkgutil</code> or <code>pkg_resources</code> to access the configuration file. See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5897666/how-do-i-use-data-in-package-data-from-source-code"">How do I use data in package_data from source code?</a> </p>

<ol>
<li>Represent directories as the directory name with a trailing slash, à la the conventions of <a href=""http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the <code>tree</code> command</a>: <code>/</code> instead of <code>&lt;root&gt;</code>, <code>moduleOne/</code> instead of <code>&lt;moduleOne&gt;</code></li>
<li>You're conflating ""module"" with ""package"". I suggest you rename <code>moduleOne/</code> to <code>packageOne/</code>. A directory with an <code>__init__.py</code> file constitutes a package. A file ending in a <code>.py</code> extension is a module. Modules can be part of packages by physically existing inside a directory with an <code>__init__.py</code> file.

"23553458","2","23541578","<p>My guess is that you get this error message at the <code>if resp[0]==correctResp:</code> line:</p>

<pre><code>IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>

<p>Is that true? If yes, it is simply because event.getKeys() returns an empty list <code>[]</code> if no responses were collected. And doing <code>[][0]</code> will give you the above error because there's no first element (index zero) just like <code>[1,2,3,4][1000]</code> will give you the same error. Note that even if you press a lot of keys and none of them are in the keyList, getKeys will return an empty list because it ignores everything but the contents of the keyList (unless you set keyList=None, in which case it accepts all keys).</p>

<p>There's a few simple ways out of this. Firstly, you can simply check whether <code>resp</code> is empty and give a ""fail"" score if it is and only check for correctness if it is not. A more general solution, which would work with many response keys and scoring criteria, is to do <code>if correctResp in resp</code> and then score as a success if yes. This comparison will work with an empty list as well, in which case it always returns <code>False</code> as empty lists per definition can't contain anything.</p>

<p>But in your particular case, you only have one response option so it is even simpler! Since you've ""filtered"" responses sing the keyList, you KNOW that if resp is [], the subject answered ""no-go"" and conversely if resp is not [], he/she answered ""go"". So:</p>

<pre><code>if im in im_n:  # im_n is an extra list of one kind of images 
     if resp:  # if subject answered 'go'
         corrFb.draw() # is defined as a ""green O""
     else:
        incorrFb.draw() # is defined as a ""red X""
</code></pre>

<p>Actually, I suspect that you also want to give feedback in trials without neutral images. In that case, define correct as <code>bool(resp) is (im in im_n)</code>:</p>

<pre><code> if bool(resp) is (im in im_n):  # if answer correspond to trial type
     corrFb.draw() # is defined as a ""green O""
 else: 
     incorrFb.draw() # is defined as a ""red X""

<p>It uses a directory with the setup.py file. The ""."" indicates this directory. This works the same way as the setuptools develop method.</p>

<p>I believe that the develop creates an egg link in your sight packages folder which points to the folder of the library. <a href=""http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#develop-deploy-the-project-source-in-development-mode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#develop-deploy-the-project-source-in-development-mode</a></p>

<pre><code>python setup.py develop

<p>I believe this is why you get the absolute path. There may be a conflict with a develop link and an install. Things could have also been moved.</p>

<p>For double clicking just have something that checks sys.argv. If there is no value for sys.argv[1] append build, install, or develop.</p>

<p>In addition, I've always heard that you want to import the modules then call the functions from the modules. from package import lib. lib.foo() that way you know where the method came from. I believe the import does the same thing for both ways; this may clean up your import. Python pathing and packaging can be a pain.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Clearly this will slow down your time integration. Always check that <code>fsolve</code> finds a good solution, and flush the output so that you can realize it as it happens and stop the simulation.</p>

<p>About how to ""cache"" the value of a variable at a previous timestep, you can exploit the fact that default arguments are calculated only at the function definition,</p>

<pre><code>from numpy import linspace
from scipy.integrate import odeint

#you can choose a better guess using fsolve instead of 0
def integral(y, _, F_l, M, cache=[0]):
    v, preva = y[1], cache[0]
    #use value for 'a' from the previous timestep
    F_r = (((1 - preva) / 3) ** 2 + (2 * (1 + preva) / 3) ** 2) * v 
    #calculate the new value
    a = (F_l - F_r) / M
    cache[0] = a
    return [v, a]

y0 = [0, 5]
time = linspace(0., 10., 1000)
F_lon = 100.
mass = 1000.

dydt = odeint(integral, y0, time, args=(F_lon, mass))

<p>Notice that in order for the trick to work the <code>cache</code> parameter must be mutable, and that's why I use a list. See <a href=""http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html#default-parameter-values"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> link if you are not familiar with how default arguments work.</p>

<p>Notice that the two codes DO NOT produce the same result, and you should be very careful using the value at the previous timestep, both for numerical stability and precision. The second is clearly much faster though.</p>

",""
"23580692","2","23577339","<p>1) Don't use globals. This should technically work, but it's bad practice and in this case there's no downside to simply adding a variable to your class. NotNone has this very moment posted an example of how to do so with a kivy property, which adds some other behaviour you may find convenient later.</p>

<p>2) Your move function isn't compatible with an eventloop driven gui like kivy (or many other gui libraries). The problem is that the <code>while</code> function is a blocking call - all of kivy's normal tasks can't be performed until the <code>move</code> function terminates. Detecting and propagating touch is one of these things, so <code>on_touch_up</code> will never be called, and the <code>touched_down</code> variable will never become False.</p>

<p>You probably instead want to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>from kivy.clock import Clock

def on_touch_down(self, touch):
    Clock.schedule_interval(self.incremental_move, 0)

def on_touch_up(self, touch):
    Clock.unschedule(self.incremental_move)

def incremental_move(self, dt):
    # write code for movement in the time dt here
</code></pre>

<p>Using the clock like this inserts the movement into the normal kivy eventloop, so it's called every frame without blocking everything else.</p>

<p>It might also be more natural to have an <code>update</code> function that is always scheduled (and does other things too), and use a <code>self.touched_down</code> attribute as above to optionally perform movement during that function.</p>

<p>It's too bad that Python doesn't allow labels on <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code> statements. Here's pseudocode for a much prettier version of the function:</p>

<pre><code>function isPrime(n, k=5)
    if n &lt; 2 then return False
    for p in [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]

        s, d = s+1, d/2

<p>On Linux, <code>os.pipe</code> is just a Python interface for accessing traditional POSIX pipes. On Windows, it's implemented using <code>CreatePipe</code>. When you call it, you get two ordinary file descriptors back. It's unidirectional, and you just write bytes to it on one end that get buffered by the kernel until someone reads from the other side. It's fairly low-level, at least by Python standards.</p>

<p><code>multiprocessing.Pipe</code> objects are much more high level interface, implemented using <code>multiprocessing.Connection</code> objects. On Linux, these are actually built on top of POSIX sockets, rather than POSIX pipes. On Windows, they're built using the <code>CreateNamedPipe</code> API. As you noted, <code>multiprocessing.Connection</code> objects can send/receive any picklable object, and will automatically handle the pickling/unpickling process, rather than just dealing with bytes. They're capable of being both bidirectional and unidirectional.</p>

My code attached below is quite crude and ugly, too. However, this does work with gdb-7.4 and python-2.7.3. An example debugging run:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc -Wall -g3 tiny.c -o tiny

<p>All of the above are bog-standard pretty-printed outputs -- my reasoning is that I often want to see what the <em>pointers</em> are, so I didn't want to override those. However, dreferencing the pointers uses the prettyprinter shown further below:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) print *iseq3
$4 = (struct boxsequence_st)(3) = {(struct boxint_st)42, (struct boxstring_st)""hello""(5), NULL}

<hr>

<p>The reasoning behind my choices are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>How to install pretty-printers to gdb</em>?</p>

<p>There are two parts to this question: where to install the Python files, and how to hook the pretty-printers to gdb.</p>

<p>Because the pretty-printer selection cannot rely on the inferred type alone, but has to peek into the actual data fields, you cannot use the regular expression matching functions. Instead, I chose to add my own pretty-printer selector function, <code>typefilter()</code>, to the global pretty-printers list, as described <a href=""https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb/Selecting-Pretty_002dPrinters.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">in the documentation</a>. I did not implement the enable/disable functionality, because I believe it is easier to just load/not load the relevant Python script instead.</p>

<p>(<code>typefilter()</code> gets called once per every variable reference, unless some other pretty-printer has already accepted it.)</p>

<p>The file location issue is a more complicated one. For application-specific pretty-printers, putting them into a single Python script file sounds sensible, but for a library, some splitting seems to be in order. The documentation <a href=""https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb/Writing-a-Pretty_002dPrinter.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">recommends</a> packaging the functions into a Python module, so that a simple <code>python import module</code> enables the pretty-printer. Fortunately, Python packaging is quite straightforward. If you were to <code>import gdb</code> to the top and save it to <code>/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/tiny.py</code>, where <code>X.Y</code> is the python version used, you only need to run <code>python import tiny</code> in gdb to enable the pretty-printer.</p>

<p>Of course, properly <a href=""https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"" rel=""noreferrer"">packaging</a> the pretty-printer is a very good idea, especially if you intend to distribute it, but it does pretty much boil down to adding some variables et cetera to the beginning of the script, assuming you keep it as a single file. For more complex pretty-printers, using a directory layout might be a good idea.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a value <code>val</code>, then <code>val.type</code> is the <a href=""https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb/Types-In-Python.html#Types-In-Python"" rel=""noreferrer"">gdb.Type</a> object describing its type; converting it to string yields a human-readable type name.</p>

<p><code>val.type.strip_typedefs()</code> yields the actual type with all typedefs stripped. I even added <code>.unqualified()</code>, so that all const/volatile/etc. type qualifiers are removed.</p></li>
<li><p>NULL pointer detection is a bit tricky.</p>

<p>The best way I found, was to examine the stringified <code>.address</code> member of the target gdb.Value object, and see if it is <code>""0x0""</code>.</p>

<p>To make life easier, I was able to write a simple <code>deref()</code> function, which tries to dereference a pointer. If the target points to (void *)0, it returns the string <code>""NULL""</code>, otherwise it returns the target gdb.Value object.</p>

<p>The way I use <code>deref()</code> is based on the fact that <code>""array""</code> type pretty-printers yield a list of 2-tuples, where the first item is the name string, and the second item is either a gdb.Value object, or a string. This list is returned by the <a href=""https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/gdb/Pretty-Printing-API.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>children()</code></a> method of the pretty-printer object.</p></li>
<li><p>Handling ""discriminated union"" types would be much easier, if you had a separate type for the generic entity. That is, if you had</p>

<pre><code>struct box_st {
    enum tag_en tag;
};
</code></pre>

<p>and it was used everywhere when the <code>tag</code> value is still uncertain; and the specific structure types only used where their <code>tag</code> value is fixed. This would allow a much simpler type inference.</p>

<p>As it is, in <code>tiny.c</code> the <code>struct box*_st</code> types can be used interchangeably. (Or, more specifically, we cannot rely on a specific tag value based on the type alone.)</p>

<p>The sequence case is actually quite simple, because <code>valtab[]</code> can be treated as simply as an array of void pointers. The sequence tag is used to pick the correct union member. In fact, if valtab[] was simply a void pointer array, then gdb.Value.cast(gdb.lookup_type()) or gdb.Value.reinterpret_cast(gdb.lookup_type()) can be used to change each pointer type as necessary, just like I do for the boxed structure types.</p></li>
<li><p>Recursion limits?</p>

<p>You can use the <code>@</code> operator in <code>print</code> command to specify how many elements are printed, but that does not help with nesting.</p>

<p>If you add <code>iseq3-&gt;valtab[2] = (myval_t)iseq3;</code> to <code>tiny.c</code>, you get an infinitely recursive sequence. gdb does print it nicely, especially with <code>set print array</code>, but it does not notice or care about the recursion.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In my opinion, you might wish to write a <strong>gdb command</strong> in addition to a pretty-printer for deeply nested or recursive data structures. During my testing, I wrote a command that uses Graphviz to draw binary tree structures directly from within gdb; I'm absolutely convinced it beats plain text output.</p>

<p>First understand that ggplot needs the datetime index to be a column in the pandas dataframe in order to plot correctly when switching from wide to long format. I wrote a function to address this particular point. It simply creates a 'Date' column of type=datetime from the pandas series index.</p>

<pre><code>def dateConvert(df):
  df['Date'] = df.index
  df.reset_index(drop=True)
  return df
</code></pre>

<p>From there run the function on the df. Use the result as the object in pandas pd.melt using the 'Date' as the id_vars. The returned df is now ready to be plotted using the standard ggplot() format. </p>

<pre><code>px_returns = px.pct_change() # common stock transformation
cumRet = (1+px_returns).cumprod() - 1 # transform daily returns to cumulative 
cumRet_dateConverted = dateConvert(cumRet) # run the function here see the result below#

cumRet_dateConverted.info()
&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;

HPQ      117 non-null float64
LNKD     117 non-null float64
MSFT     117 non-null float64
YHOO     117 non-null float64
Date     118 non-null datetime64[ns]
dtypes: datetime64[ns](1), float64(8)


data = pd.melt(cumRet_dateConverted, id_vars='Date').dropna() # Here is the method I use to format the data in the long format. Please note the use of 'Date' as the id_vars.

data = data.rename(columns = {'Date':'Date','variable':'Stocks','value':'Returns'}) # common to rename these columns
</code></pre>

<p>From here you can now plot your data however you want. A common plot I use is the following:</p>

+ scale_x_date(labels='%b %d %y',breaks=date_breaks('week') ) \
+ theme_seaborn(style='whitegrid') \
+ ggtitle(('%s Cumulative Daily Return vs Peers_YTD') % key_Stock)

"26285749","2","121396","<p>There are a few issues here that aren't covered by any of the other answers.</p>

<p>First, <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#id"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>id</code></a> only returns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the “identity” of an object. This is an integer (or long integer) which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same <code>id()</code> value.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>In CPython, this happens to be the pointer to the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>PyObject</code></a> that represents the object in the interpreter, which is the same thing that <code>object.__repr__</code> displays. But this is just an implementation detail of CPython, not something that's true of Python in general. Jython doesn't deal in pointers, it deals in Java references (which the JVM of course probably represents as pointers, but you can't see those—and wouldn't want to, because the GC is allowed to move them around). PyPy lets different types have different kinds of <code>id</code>, but the most general is just an index into a table of objects you've called <code>id</code> on, which is obviously not going to be a pointer. I'm not sure about IronPython, but I'd suspect it's more like Jython than like CPython in this regard. So, in most Python implementations, there's no way to get whatever showed up in that <code>repr</code>, and no use if you did.</p>

<hr>

<p>But what if you only care about CPython? That's a pretty common case, after all.</p>

<p>Well, first, you may notice that <code>id</code> is an integer;* if you want that <code>0x2aba1c0cf890</code> string instead of the number <code>46978822895760</code>, you're going to have to format it yourself. Under the covers, I believe <code>object.__repr__</code> is ultimately using <code>printf</code>'s <code>%p</code> format, which you don't have from Python… but you can always do this:</p>

<pre><code>format(id(spam), '#010x' if sys.maxsize.bit_length() &lt;= 32 else '#18x')
</code></pre>

<p><sub>* In 3.x, it's an <code>int</code>. In 2.x, it's an <code>int</code> if that's big enough to hold a pointer—which is may not be because of signed number issues on some platforms—and a <code>long</code> otherwise.</sub></p>

<p>Is there anything you can do with these pointers besides print them out? Sure (again, assuming you only care about CPython).</p>

<p>All of the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">C API</a> functions take a pointer to a <code>PyObject</code> or a related type. For those related types, you can just call <code>PyFoo_Check</code> to make sure it really is a <code>Foo</code> object, then cast with <code>(PyFoo *)p</code>. So, if you're writing a C extension, the <code>id</code> is exactly what you need.</p>

<p>What if you're writing pure Python code? You can call the exact same functions with <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#accessing-values-exported-from-dlls"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>pythonapi</code></a> from <code>ctypes</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, a few of the other answers have brought up <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.addressof"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ctypes.addressof</code></a>. That isn't relevant here. This only works for <code>ctypes</code> objects like <code>c_int32</code> (and maybe a few memory-buffer-like objects, like those provided by <code>numpy</code>). And, even there, it isn't giving you the address of the <code>c_int32</code> value, it's giving you the address of the C-level <code>int32</code> that the <code>c_int32</code> wraps up.</p>

<p>That being said, more often than not, if you really think you need the address of something, you didn't want a native Python object in the first place, you wanted a <code>ctypes</code> object.</p>

"26875847","2","15738700","<p>This question has been answered but I wanted to address the comment that using list comprehension is much slower than using <code>.remove()</code>.</p>

<p>Some profiles from my machine (using Python 2.7.6).</p>

<pre><code>%%timeit
x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
y = x[:]  # fastest way to copy
y.remove('c')

1000000 loops, best of 3: 405 ns per loop

%%timeit
x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
y = list(x)  # not as fast copy
y.remove('c')

1000000 loops, best of 3: 689 ns per loop

y = [n for n in x if n != 'c']  # list comprehension

1000000 loops, best of 3: 544 ns per loop

<p>If you use the fastest way to copy a list (which isn't very readable), you will be about 36% faster than using list comprehension.  But if you copy the list by using the <code>list()</code> class (which is much more common and Pythonic), then you're going to be 26% slower than using list comprehension.</p>

<p>Really, it's all pretty fast. I think the argument could be made that <code>.remove()</code> is more readable than list a list comprehension technique, but it's not necessarily faster unless you're interested in giving up readability in the duplication.  </p>

<p>The big advantage of list comprehension in this scenario is that it's much more succinct (i.e. if you had a function that was to remove an element from a given list for some reason, it could be done in 1 line, whilst the other method would require 3 lines.)  There are times in which one-liners can be very handy (although they typically come at the cost of some readability).  Additionally, using list comprehension excels in the case when you don't actually know if the element to be removed is actually in the list to begin with.

<p>I started with <code>ipython locate</code> to tell me where ipython thought config files suggested elsewhere should be. When I saw it was different I read around and came up with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>On my system, the <code>ipython locate</code> gave me <code>c:\users\osmith\.ipython</code>, not the <code>_ipython</code> you'll see mentioned in the YouTube videos done with Windows XP,</li>
<li>Look in the directory <code>ipython locate</code> specifies for a profile directory; if you aren't actively doing anything with ipython profiles, it should be <code>.ipython\profile_default</code>, if you are using profiles, then I leave it to you to s/profile_default/${YOUR_PROFILE_NAME}/<strong>g</strong></li>
<li>Check the profile_default directory for a <code>ipython_config.py</code> file, if it's not there, tell IPython to initialize itself: <code>ipython profile create</code></li>
<li>Open the config file in a text editor,</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are the kind of person who hasn't messed around with their console overly much and installs things in standard places, you can skip straight to this step by typing: <code>ipython profile create</code> followed by <code>start notepad .ipython\profile_default\ipython_config.py</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Search for the string <code>c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor</code>,</li>
<li>The comment above this indicates you can also use the EDITOR environment variable, but hard coding file paths never hurt anyone so lets do eet:</li>
<li>Copy the line and remove the leading hash and spaces from the copy.</li>
<li><p>Replace the text between the apostrophes (<code>'notepad'</code>) with the path of our desired editor, e.g.</p>

<p>c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor = 'c:/program files (x86)/noddyeditor/noddy.exe'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a catch here, though; some modern editors get a bit fancy and automatically and, when invoked like this, detach from the console. Notepad++ and Sublime Text, for example. Sublime accepts a ""--wait"" option, which works some of the time; this tells the command invocation to hang around until you close the file, for some definition of <code>until</code> and some other definition of <code>close</code>.</p>

<p>However, the following setting will work most of the time for sublime text:</p>

"31391497","2","31391400","<p>Yes. You can create a Python C++ extension where your C++ objects will be visible from within Python as if they were built-in types.</p>

<p>There are two main ways to go about it.</p>

<p>1.Create the extension yourself following the documentation provided in the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html"" rel=""nofollow"">CPython API Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>2.Create the extension using a tool such as <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/"" rel=""nofollow"">boost::python</a> or <a href=""http://www.swig.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">SWIG</a>.</p>

<p>In my experience boost::python is the best way to go about it (it saves you an enormous amount of time, and the price you pay is that now you depend on boost).</p>

<p>For your example, the boost::python bindings could look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// foo.cpp
#include &lt;boost/python.hpp&gt;

class A {

 public:

  A(int i)
      : m_i{i} { }

  int get_i() const {
    return m_i;
  }
 private:
  // don't use names such as `_i`; those are reserved for the
  // implementation
  int m_i;
};

BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(foo) {
  using namespace boost::python;

  class_&lt;A&gt;(""A"", init&lt;int&gt;())
      .def(""get_i"", &amp;A::get_i, ""This is the docstring for A::get_i"")
      ;
}

<p>Compile:</p>

<pre><code>g++ -o foo.so foo.cpp -std=c++11 -fPIC -shared \
-Wall -Wextra `python2.7-config --includes --libs` \
-lboost_python
</code></pre>

<p>and run in Python:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import foo
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = foo.A(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.get_i()
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a.get_i.__doc__

get_i( (A)arg1) -&gt; int :
    This is the docstring for A::get_i

"31391447","2","31391400","<p>Short Answer: Yes, of course. All you need is to wrap the C++ code with a Python wrapper.</p>

<p>Elaborated: </p>

<p>Suppose your C++ code is inside <code>class_file.h</code>. In the same directory, create a <code>.pxd</code> file with any name of your choice with the following content</p>

<pre><code>cdef extern from ""class_file.h"":
    cdef cppclass A:
        int _i
        A(int)
        int get_i
</code></pre>

<p>This is the wrapper of the C++ file. That's all you have to do using Cython. Further you need to write a <code>.pyx</code> file and <code>cimport</code> your <code>pxd</code> file like a simple module. You also need to have a <code>setup.py</code> which will create a <code>.so</code> file which can be imported by Python as easily as any other python module.</p>

<p>Do visit <a href=""http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html</a> for any more help. I hope you find Cython very easy and very light-based.</p>

<p>In your current implementation, you will probably notice that each time you call <code>GetVideo</code>, the memory increases by about the same amount as the size (in MB) of a single image. It is my guess that by using some of the more specific methods available to <code>cap.cam</code> (an instance of the <code>Aravis.Camera</code>), you will be able to set up a ""ring"" structure, which is typical for streaming video.

"23580052","2","23579946","<p>well your code is not so bad, though there's one useless thing, which is your object Pair. You may just as well store the radius as value in the dict:</p>

<p>Reread your code! You're not looping over the dictionary, you're iterating over the <em>sub_list</em>! Maybe this is a syntax problem, here's how you could rewrite that iteration:</p>

<pre><code>values=[]
for ind in sub_list:
    values.append(d[x, y])

<p>And think about it, what you want is to get the precalculated radius value for each element of the sublist. So there's actually no other way than iterating over the sublist! Whether you do it using a list comprehension or a map is mostly a matter of personal preference, even though the list comprehension is more efficient:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.repeat(lambda: [d[ind] for ind in sub_list])
[0.8207108974456787, 0.8075330257415771, 0.788733959197998]

<p>If not, you could try one of the following:</p>

"23579403","2","23578018","<p>Firstly, the thing to remember is that these classes are representations of underlying database tables. A ForeignKey field in a Django model represents a one-to-many relationship in the database, with an _id field representing the ID of another table. Those tables are themselves independent, but are linked via the FK field (and the relevant index constraint, if the database supports them).</p>

<p>That said, in your Car model <code>manufacturer</code> is a required field (because you haven't defined it as <code>null=True</code>). So when you create a Car, you must point it at an <em>already existing</em> Manufacturer - and that manufacturer must have been saved already, so that Django can populate the underlying <code>manufacturer_id</code> field with the ID of the related object</p>

<p>Because Django is aware of the foreign key relationship between the two objects, you can use them when querying. In SQL this would be done via JOINs: Django gives you a special syntax to do queries across those joins, via double underscores. So, for example, if you wanted to get all the cars made by a manufacturer created in 1990 (assuming that's what you mean by the <code>company_created</code> field), you would do this:</p>

<pre><code>Car.objects.filter(manufacturer__company_created='1990')
</code></pre>

<p>Django translates this into something like"":</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * from car JOIN manufacturer ON car.manufacturer_id=manufacturer.id WHERE manufacturer.company_created='1990';
</code></pre>

<p>If you already have your ""civic"" instance and just want to get access to the related data, this is pure Python object access: <code>civic.manufacturer</code> is the related Manufacturer object, so you can simply do <code>civic.manufacturer.company_created</code> to get the relevant data. Again, Django translates that into the database access, but from your point of view this is simple object composition.</p>

<p>Note that really all this is fully explained in the tutorial, with relationships between Poll and Choice which exactly match your Manufacturer and Car models.</p>

"23579089","2","23578456","<p>I do not think it is the language data structure type that should be differentiated, but it is more about the data you send over. Note that, different languages may have different language structures and so on. That is just really low-level details. What is more important is what you send.</p>

<p>You could look into the following example how the serialization/deserialization works with json format in QtCore. Json is also supported in python quite well by the json module, so you would have no issue on the server side to deserialize it:</p>

<p><a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtcore-savegame-example.html"" rel=""nofollow"">JSON Save Game Example</a></p>

<p>This is basically the important part that would give you some hint on the client side. Do not get lost at saving into a file. It is basically writing the raw bytes to the file, which you would replace by sending over the network:</p>

<pre><code>void Game::write(QJsonObject &amp;json) const
{
    QJsonObject playerObject;
    mPlayer.write(playerObject);
    json[""player""] = playerObject;

    QJsonArray levelArray;
    foreach (const Level level, mLevels) {
        QJsonObject levelObject;
        level.write(levelObject);
        levelArray.append(levelObject);
    }
    json[""levels""] = levelArray;
}
</code></pre>

<p>... and then you would do something like this on the server side, again instead of reading from file, you would read from the network, but that is not a biggie as both are IO.</p>

<pre><code>import json
json_data=open(file_directory).read()

data = json.loads(json_data)
pprint(data)
</code></pre>

<p>You could use raw protocol to design your own, or just use an extending. I would suggest to go with something standard, like http (tcp/udp). Then, you would only need to define the json format for your own data, and not deal with all the rest, like one-way or two-way communication, transaction identifier against reply attack, timestamp, data size and so on. </p>

<p>This would allow you to truly concentrate on the important stuff for you. Once, you have your own json format defined, you could look into the <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtnetwork-index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">QtNetwork module</a> to send post, get, put and delete requests as you wish.</p>

<p>You would probably work closely with the <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qnetworkaccessmanager.html"" rel=""nofollow"">QNetworkManager</a>, <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qnetworkreply.html"" rel=""nofollow"">QNetworkReply</a> classes, and so on.

"23578991","2","23578456","<p>Trying to answer your questions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are the methods mentioned above sufficient to send complexe data, and how ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yes, sending a raw byte array is the lowest level format. However, you need a <em>something</em> that can get you uniquely from your complex data to the byte array and from the byte array back to your complex data.</p>

<p>This process is called in different ways, encoding, serializing, marshalling.... But in general it just means creating a system for encoding complex structures into a sequence of bytes or characters</p>

<p>There are many you can choose from: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One"" rel=""nofollow"">ASN.1</a>, <a href=""http://www.json.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">JSON</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"" rel=""nofollow"">XML</a>, <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/"" rel=""nofollow"">Google's protocol buffers</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME"" rel=""nofollow"">MIME</a>.... </p>

<p>You can even design your own (e.g. a simple schema is using TLV: (Tag-Length-Value), where Tag is an identifier of the Type and Value can be a basic type [and you have to define a representation for each type that you consider basic] or again one or more TLV), Length indicates how many bytes/characters are used to encode the Value.</p>

<p>What to choose depends a lot of where you encode (language/platform) and where you decode (language/platform) and your requirements for speed, bandwidth usage, transport, whether messages should be inspected... etc.</p>

<p>If you're dealing with heterogenous architectures you might need to think about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness"" rel=""nofollow"">endianness</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, you should distinguish between the format (i.e. how the complex structure is expressed as a sequence of bytes in the line) and the library used for encoding (or the library used for decoding). Sometimes they will be linked, sometimes for the same format you will have a choice of libraries to use.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how to deal with the data types in the server side (with Python) ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, here you have a requirement... if you're going for a externally provided format, you must make sure it has a python library able to decode it.</p>

<p>if you're going for a home-grown solution, one of things you should define is the expression of your complex C++ structures as Python structures.</p>

<p>An additional possibility is to do everything in C++, and for the python server side use one of the systems for creating python extensions in C++ (e.g. <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/python/doc/"" rel=""nofollow"">boost-python</a> or <a href=""http://www.swig.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">swig</a>....)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>do you think I should use an other protocol like HTTP (with the QNetworkAccessManager class) ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It depends on what you try to do. 
There are many HTTP libraries widely available that you can use on different languages and different architectures.</p>

<p>You still need to solve the problem of deciding the formatting of your information (although HTTP have some defined practices). </p>

<p>In addition HTTP is clearly biased towards the communication of a client with a server, with the action always initiated by the client. </p>

<p>Things get complex (or less widely supported) when is the server the one that needs to initiate the communication or the one that needs to send spontaneous information.</p>

<p>For maxMatching, this is also possible, but it takes some more work. However, do you notice that your recursion builds the dp table from top left to bottom right? And that you use the values of the dp to calculate the value maxMatching more to the right and to the bottom?</p>

<p>So what you can do is to create a helper table (like dp and boolean) and construct that from top to bottom and left to right. For each of the cells you calculate the value based on the values as you would now, but instead of using recursion, you use the value from the helper table.</p>

"23564109","2","23560161","<p>As per my understanding of your question, your application is not closing when you click on the close button (The red button with X on the right top corner.)</p>

<p>By default when you click the close button your application should close. In your case it seems to me that you have bind the <code>EVT_CLOSE</code> to some method, which has no code in it to close the app window.
For eg. consider the code snippet below, I have intentionally bind the <code>EVT_CLOSE</code> event to a method named as <code>closeWindow()</code>. This method does nothing that is why I have the <code>pass</code> keyword there. Now if you execute the code snippet below you can see that the app window won't close.</p>

<p><strong>Code</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>import wx
class GUI(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self, parent, id, title):
        screenWidth = 500

        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None, id, title, size=screenSize)
        self.Bind(wx.EVT_CLOSE, self.closeWindow)  #Bind the EVT_CLOSE event to closeWindow()

    frame = GUI(parent=None, id=-1, title=""Problem Demo-PSS"")
    frame.Show()
    app.MainLoop()

<p>So, in order to close the app window you need to change the <code>closeWindow()</code>. For eg: Following code snippet will use the <a href=""http://www.wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.Window-class.html#Destroy"" rel=""nofollow"">Destroy()</a> close the app window when you click on the close button.</p>

<p>There is a ""/Lang"" key in the Document Catalog. In my version of the PDF specification this is explained in section 7.7.2.</p>

<p>This language key defines the language assumed for the complete document, with the exception of those parts that are marked differently.</p>

<p>So, two caveats:
1) This ""/Lang"" key is optional. If it's not there the PDF specification says the language is undefined.</p>

<p>2) This ""/Lang"" key may be overwritten by other elements in the file. So the entire document may be English, but specific sentences on page 101 may redefine the language as French for example.</p>

<p>In your case, your algorithm should first try to find the overall document language as defined above. If that's not there it's up to you what to do. You could search the complete document for ""/Lang"" keys to see if you find any other, but if you find multiple, you'll have to decide what that means...</p>

<p>Thus, the length of the names has no influence on how much memory each instance uses for the slots; the names only take space in the <code>__dict__</code> attribute on the class (mapping name to descriptor), and in the descriptor object itself (to provide a string representation of the object); the string is interned even.</p>

<p>You can check how the custom descriptors are given their state in the <a href=""http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/db842f730432/Objects/typeobject.c#l2404"" rel=""nofollow"">C source code for <code>type.__new__()</code></a>:</p>

"23540390","2","23540052","<p>In the first query, your variables are identifiers, whereas in the second they're literal strings.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be putting parenthesis with the identifiers, and they shouldn't be wrapped in single quotes unless you further wrap them with double quotes.</p>

<p>For instance, this would create a table called <code>'foo'</code> rather than <code>foo</code>:</p>

<pre><code>create table ""'foo'"" ();
</code></pre>

<p>And these would all spit out errors:</p>

<pre><code>create table 'foo' ();   -- requires double quotes
create table (foo) ();   -- unexpected parenthesis
create table ('foo') (); -- both problems
</code></pre>

<p>If you really want to use parameters for identifiers, you'll need to use a dynamic SQL statement. In this case, you'll also need to worry about quoting the identifiers using PG if applicable, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>DO $$
BEGIN
 PERFORM ' CREATE TABLE ' || quote_ident(%s) || ' ()';
END;
$$;
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, the outer string is delimited by <code>$$</code>, and the inner strings are delimited by <code>'</code>. After parameters get replaced, it'll look like:</p>

<pre><code>' CREATE TABLE ' || quote_ident('foo') || ' ()'
</code></pre>

<p>And then:</p>

<pre><code>' CREATE DATABASE ' || '""foo""' || ' ()'
</code></pre>

<p>And finally:</p>

<pre><code>' CREATE DATABASE ""foo"" ()'
</code></pre>

<p>This particular statement of yours, however, <em>cannot</em> be part of a transaction so cannot go in a do statement. As such, you'll need to resort to doing the string manipulation in Python directly.</p>

<p>What <code>quote_ident()</code> does is, in essence, wrap in double quotes after doubling all double quotes in the input. For instance:</p>

<pre><code># select quote_ident('foo""bar');
 quote_ident 
-------------
 ""foo""""bar""
(1 row)
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not familiar enough with Python to write that for you, but that's basically the subroutine you'll need to make it work. Then pass the final SQL string — with the parameters in it replaced — to Postgres directly.</p>

<p>Don't just hastily pick the first import strategy that works for you or else you'll have to rewrite the codebase later on when you find it doesn't meet your needs.  </p>

<p>I start out explaining the the easiest console example #1, then move toward the most professional and robust program example #5</p>

<p><strong>Example 1, Import a python module with python interpreter:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put this in /home/el/foo/fox.py:</p>

<pre><code>def what_does_the_fox_say():
  print ""vixens cry""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Get into the python interpreter: </p>

<pre><code>el@apollo:/home/el/foo$ python
Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
&gt;&gt;&gt; import fox
&gt;&gt;&gt; fox.what_does_the_fox_say()
vixens cry
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>You invoked the python function <code>what_does_the_fox_say()</code> from within the file <code>fox</code> through the python interpreter.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Option 2, Use execfile in a script to execute the other python file in place:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put this in /home/el/foo2/mylib.py:</p>

<pre><code>def moobar():
  print ""hi""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Put this in /home/el/foo2/main.py:</p>

<pre><code>execfile(""/home/el/foo2/mylib.py"")
moobar()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>run the file:</p>

<pre><code>el@apollo:/home/el/foo$ python main.py
hi
</code></pre>

<p>The function moobar was imported from mylib.py and made available in main.py</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Option 3, Use from ... import ... functionality:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put this in /home/el/foo3/chekov.py:</p>

<pre><code>def question():
  print ""where are the nuclear wessels?""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Put this in /home/el/foo3/main.py:</p>

<pre><code>from chekov import question
question()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run it like this:</p>

<pre><code>el@apollo:/home/el/foo3$ python main.py 
where are the nuclear wessels?
</code></pre>

<p>If you defined other functions in chekov.py, they would not be available unless you <code>import *</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Option 4, Import riaa.py if it's in a different file location from where it is imported</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put this in /home/el/foo4/bittorrent/riaa.py:</p>

<pre><code>def watchout_for_riaa_mpaa():
  print ""there are honeypot kesha songs on bittorrent that log IP "" +
  ""addresses of seeders and leechers. Then comcast records strikes against "" +
  ""that user and thus, the free internet was transmogified into "" +
  ""a pay-per-view cable-tv enslavement device back in the 20th century.""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Put this in /home/el/foo4/main.py:</p>

<pre><code>import sys 
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(""/home/el/foo4/bittorrent""))
from riaa import *

watchout_for_riaa_mpaa()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run it:</p>

<pre><code>el@apollo:/home/el/foo4$ python main.py 
there are honeypot kesha songs on bittorrent...
</code></pre>

<p>That imports everything in the foreign file from a different directory.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Option 5, Import files in python with the bare import command:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Make a new directory <code>/home/el/foo5/</code></li>
<li>Make a new directory <code>/home/el/foo5/herp</code></li>
<li><p>Make an empty file named <code>__init__.py</code> under herp:</p>

<pre><code>el@apollo:/home/el/foo5/herp$ touch __init__.py
el@apollo:/home/el/foo5/herp$ ls
__init__.py
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Make a new directory /home/el/foo5/herp/derp</p></li>
<li><p>Under derp, make another <code>__init__.py</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>el@apollo:/home/el/foo5/herp/derp$ touch __init__.py
el@apollo:/home/el/foo5/herp/derp$ ls
__init__.py
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Under /home/el/foo5/herp/derp make a new file called <code>yolo.py</code> Put this in there:</p>

<pre><code>def skycake():
  print ""SkyCake evolves to stay just beyond the cognitive reach of "" +
  ""the bulk of men. SKYCAKE!!""
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>The moment of truth, Make the new file <code>/home/el/foo5/main.py</code>, put this in there;</p>

<pre><code>from herp.derp.yolo import skycake
skycake()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Run it:</p>

<pre><code>el@apollo:/home/el/foo5$ python main.py
SkyCake evolves to stay just beyond the cognitive reach of the bulk 
of men. SKYCAKE!!
</code></pre>

<p>The empty <code>__init__.py</code> file communicates to the python interpreter that the developer intends this directory to be an importable package.</p></li>

"31421901","2","31409719","<p>Your example is a strange if not an invalid YAML file, which makes it a bit of guess work what is going on here. The reason that it is a problematic YAML file is the </p>

<pre><code>LFSDetails: |
</code></pre>

<p>line which has a different indentation (i.e. is outdented) compared to the lines before and after.</p>

<p>Up until <code>LFSDetails</code> the YAML file looks like it has a mapping at the top level. So the intial solution might be to just push <code>LFSDetails</code> in with two spaces to align it with that. That would result in an empty string as its literal block scalar (introduced with <code>|</code> and your code seems to rely on YAML as text block within YAML. So it looks like the indentation following all of the lines following <code>LFSDetails</code> is correct.</p>

<p>For your error message to appear your YAML file has to start with a dash (sequence indicator) indented 3 spaces:</p>

<pre><code>   -

</code></pre>

<p>gives this error (I stripped out the irrelevant intermediate mapping entries). This however parses, but completely drops anything after the outdentation by <code>LFSDetails</code> ¹:</p>

<pre><code>import ruamel.yaml as yaml

<p>Because of the dash the mapping starting with <code>Version:</code> is the first element of a sequence/list and after that trying to access a list element with a string (<code>LFSDetails</code>) gets you the error.</p>

<p>You should therefore <strong>first clean up your YAML to make it correct</strong>. I also suggest to include the <a href=""http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2760395"" rel=""nofollow"">start of document marker</a> (<code>---</code>) even if you only have one document in the example file, since you are using <code>load_all()</code>.

<p>The Python interpreter, the 3 libraries you refer to directly, anything <em>those</em> libraries use, all need to be loaded from disk, quite apart from the script and it's bytecode cache. The OS caches such files for faster access.</p>

<p>If you ran other things on the same system, those files will be flushed from the cache and need to be loaded again.</p>

<p>The same applies to directory listings; the checks for where to find the modules in the module search path and tests for bytecode caches all are sped up by cached directory information.</p></li>

<p>Before it was possible to tell Selenium, don't run this at normal speed, run it at a slower speed to allow more things to be available on page load, for slow loading pages or AJAX'ified pages.</p>

<p>Now, you do away with that altogether. Example:</p>

<p>I have a login page, I login and once logged in I see a ""Welcome"" message. The problem is the Welcome message is not displayed instantly and is on a time delay (using jQuery).</p>

<p><strong>Pre WebDriver Code</strong> would dictate to Selenium, run this test, but slow down <em>here</em> so we can wait until the Welcome message appears.</p>

<p><strong>Newer WebDriver code</strong> would dictate to Selenium, run this test, but when we login, wait up to 20 seconds for the Welcome Message to appearing, using <a href=""http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp"">explicit waits.</a></p>

<p>Now, if you really want access to ""set"" Selenium's speed, first off I'd recommend against it but the solution would be to dive into the older, now deprecated code.</p>

<p>If you use WebDriver heavily already, you can use the <code>WebDriverBackedSelenium</code> which can give you access to the older Selenium methods, whilst keeping the WebDriver backing the same, therefore much of your code would stay the same.</p>

"15740694","2","15740236","<p>Yes, there is a good reason not to start all your Python programs like that. </p>

<p>First of all: </p>

<p><code>sys.stdout.encoding</code> is None if Python doesn't know what encoding the stdout supports. This, in most cases, is because it doesn't really support any encoding at all. In your case it's because the stdout is a file, and not a terminal. But it could be set to None because Python also fails to detect the encoding of the terminal.</p>

<p>Second of all: You set the environment variable and then start a new process with the smae command again. That's pretty ugly.</p>

<p>So, unless you plan to be the only one using your programs, you shouldn't start them like that. But if you <em>do</em> plan to be the only using your program, then go ahead. </p>

<p><strong>More in-depth explanation</strong></p>

<p>A better generic solution under Python 2 is to treat stdout as what it is: An 8-bit interface. And that means that anything you print to to stdout should be 8-bit. You get the error when you are trying to print Unicode data, because print will then try to encode the Unicode data to the encoding of stdout, and if it's None it will assume ASCII, and fail, unless you set PYTHONIOENCODING.</p>

<p>But by printing encoded data, you don't have this problem. The following works perfectly even when the output is piped:</p>

<pre><code>print u'ÅÄÖ'.encode('UTF8')
</code></pre>

<p>(However, this will fail Under Python 3, because under Python 3, stdout is no longer 8-bit IO, you are supposed to give it Unicode data, and it will encode by itself. If you give it binary data, it will print the representation. Therefore on Python 3 you don't have this problem in the first place).</p>

"15740127","2","15739086","<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: if you have some gigabytes of RAM, use Python dictionaries, it's the easiest way to implement (and probably the faster to run). You can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 0 in mydict

<p><strong>Long answer</strong>: you can use a persistent key-value store, like <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/gdbm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GDBM</a> (it looks like Berkeley DB) or another kind of database -- but this approach will be <em>way</em> slower than using just Python dictionaries; on the other hand, with this approach you'll have persistance (if you need). </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import gdbm

<p>Then the file <code>my.db</code> will be created (see <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/gdbm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Python GDBM documentation</a> to understand what <code>cf</code> means).</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Walk</em> function uses three arguments, the child node, the parent node and the <em>work</em> function.</li>
<li>The <em>walk</em> function calls the <em>work</em> function after visiting the child nodes.</li>
<li>The <em>work</em> function takes both child and parent nodes as arguments so pruning the child is as easy as <code>parent['children'].remove(child)</code></li>
<li><em>Update</em>: As noticed in the comments, if you delete from a sequence while iterating, it will skip elements. <code>for child in list(node.get('children',[]))</code> in the <code>walk</code> function copies the list of children allowing the entries to be removed from the parent's key without skipping.</li>

<p>But using <code>local-name</code> we can still get the element (considering the namespace)</p>

<pre><code>tree.xpath('//*[local-name() = ""html""]')
# [&lt;Element {http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}html at 0x103b8d848&gt;]
</code></pre>

<p>Or strict namespace using <code>name()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>tree.xpath('//*[name() = ""x:html""]')
# [&lt;Element {http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml}html at 0x103b8d848&gt;]
</code></pre>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>I parsed this website as a tree and used the following queries:</p>

<pre><code>%timeit tree.xpath('//*[local-name() = ""div""]')
# 1000 loops, best of 3: 570 µs per loop

%timeit tree.xpath('//div')
# 10000 loops, best of 3: 44.4 µs per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Now onto actual namespaces. I parsed a block from <a href=""http://books.xmlschemata.org/relaxng/relax-CHP-11-SECT-1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>example = """""" ... """"""
from lxml.etree import fromstring
tree = fromstring(example)

%timeit tree.xpath('//hr:author', 
                   namespaces = {'hr' : 'http://eric.van-der-vlist.com/ns/person'})
# 100000 loops, best of 3: 18.2 µs per loop

%timeit tree.xpath('//*[local-name() = ""author""]')
# 10000 loops, best of 3: 37.7 µs per loop
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I had to rewrite to conclusion since after using the namespace method it became obvious that the gain when using namespaces is also there. Roughly 2 times faster when specifying the namespace (causing optimizations), rather than using <code>local-name</code>.</p>

<p>There's a bug report <a href=""https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv/issues/415"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but long story short is that pyenv uses shims to intercept package imports and route them correctly.</p>

<p>This means that pyenv has to muddle with the path. When I run python directly, the shims are apparent in the python path:</p>

<pre><code>[dnelson@blueharvest somedir]$ python
Python 2.7 (r27:82500, Jun  1 2015, 15:01:57)

<p>However, in the dynamically imported package, the same code results in an output of:</p>

<pre><code>['/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages', '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages', '/usr/lib/site-python']
['/usr', '/usr']
</code></pre>

<p>So, the issue appears to be that pyenv isn't doing its shim magic during dynamic imports.</p>

<p>To solve the problem, I used <code>pip install --user</code> to force pip to install to the place where the dynamic import is looking, rather than where pyenv wants the install to go. (also add a <code>-I</code> if you've previously installed the package to force a reinstall)</p>

<p>It can also be solved by appending the install location (in my case, <code>/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages</code>) to the python path using <code>sys.path.append</code>, but that smells awful and could cause problems down the line for other people.</p>

"15719147","2","15719058","<p>The problem with checking before an operation is that the bad condition you're checking for could happen between the check and the operation.</p>

<pre><code>if not self.cursor.is_timed_out():
    self.cursor.execute(""SELECT * FROM incomes"")

<p>On the face of it, this looks like you've avoided the possibility of a CursorTimedOut exception from the execute call.  But it's possible for you to call is_timed_out, get a False back, then the cursor times out, and then you call the execute function, and get an exception.</p>

<p>Yes, the chance is very small that it will happen at just the right moment.  But in a server environment, a one-in-a-million chance will happen a few times a day.  Bad stuff.</p>

<p>When you try to run one test from the class (Right Click -> Run 'Unittest test_print') PyCharm has a problem to load your tests print_1_1, print_2_2 as it is trying to load test_print test.</p>

<p>Ok. So my fix for that is to load proper tests from the class. It is just a workaround and it is not perfect, however as DDT is adding a TestCase as another method to the class it is hard to find a different way to detect right test cases than comparing by string. So instead of:</p>

<pre><code>try:

<ul>
<li><p>test_print</p></li>

<li><p>test_if_prints_2</p></li>

<p>First, let's create a 80 byte test file;</p>

<pre><code>dd if=/dev/random of=test1.dat bs=80 count=1
</code></pre>

<p>Then we define a function to read all of it;</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: def readfile(name):
   ...:     with open(name) as f:
   ...:         data = f.read()
   ...:     return data
   ...: 
</code></pre>

<p>Then, a timing run (reading from a normal harddisk, not an SSD):</p>

<pre><code>In [3]: %timeit readfile('test1.dat')
10000 loops, best of 3: 18.1 us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>So it takes 18 μs to read such a file. I wouldn't call that slow.</p>

<p>When I create 9 of these test files and read them in a loop:</p>

<pre><code>In [3]: %timeit for i in xrange(1,10): readfile('test{:d}.dat'.format(i))
1000 loops, best of 3: 184 us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>With the loop overhead it is still only about 21 μs per file.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Having seen your code, it seems pretty complicated for what it does. I would structure it like this:</p>

<pre><code>data = []
temp = []
for sn in ['/home/pi/sensoren/sensor{:d}'.format(i) for i in range(1,11)]: 
                                                            #xrange if Python 2.x
    with open(sn) as f:
        data.append(f.read())
# the data list now contains all sensor data
for num, s in enumerate(data):
    # check for CRC
    d = s.strip()
    if d.startswith(""YES""):
        t = d.split(""t="")
        # populate temp list
        if t[1] == '-62':
            temp.append(""00"")
        else:
            temp.append(t[1])

These methods are expected to do all the copying themselves, the <code>__deepcopy__()</code> method is passed a memo mapping to pass on to recursive <code>deepcopy()</code> calls.</p>

<p>An example could be:</p>

<pre><code>from copy import deepcopy

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, bar):
        self.bar = bar
        self.spam = expression + that * generates - ham   # calculated

    def __copy__(self):
        # self.spam is to be ignored, it is calculated anew for the copy
        # create a new copy of ourselves *reusing* self.bar
        return type(self)(self.bar)

    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        # self.spam is to be ignored, it is calculated anew for the copy
        # create a new copy of ourselves with a deep copy of self.bar
        # pass on the memo mapping to recursive calls to copy.deepcopy
        return type(self)(deepcopy(self.bar, memo))

<li>A very simple solution would be to just merge both modules, so you only have a single module that only depends on itself, or rather on its own contents.

<p>I programmed this for my mailgroup using mailbox, that is why it is so convoluted.
It never failed me. Never any junk. If message is multipart, output dictionary will contain a
key ""files"" (a sub dict) with all filenames of extracted other files that were not text or html.
That was a way of extracting attachments and other binary data.
You may change it in pullout(), or just change the behaviour of file_exists() and save_file().</p>

<p>construct_name() constructs a filename out of message id and multipart message 
filename, if there is one.</p>

<p>In pullout() the Text and Html variables are strings. For online mailgroup it was OK to get any text or HTML packed into multipart that wasn't an attachment at once.</p>

<p>If you need something more sophisticated change Text and Html to lists and append to them and add them as needed.
Nothing problematic.</p>

<p>Maybe there are some errors here, because it is intended to work with mailbox.Message(),
not with email.Message(). I tried it on email.Message() and it worked fine.</p>

<p>You said, you ""wish to list them all"". From where?  If you refer to the POP3 mailbox or a mailbox of some nice open-source mailer, then you do it using mailbox module.
If you want to list them from others, then you have a problem.
For example, to get mails from MS Outlook, you have to know how to read OLE2 compound files.
Other mailers rarely refer to them as *.eml files, so I think this is exactly what you would like to do.
Then search on PyPI for olefile or compoundfiles module and Google around for how to extract an e-mail from MS Outlook inbox file.
Or save yourself a mess and just export them from there to some directory. When you have them as eml files, then apply this code.</p>

It will not be messed up - what will happen is that if the socket has a timeout - and you pause for more than the timeout, the other side of the socket will assume your code is dead and will give a timeout exception.

<p>If you post a form, in which a key maps to a list:</p>

<pre><code>d = {""a"": 123, ""b"": [1,2,3]}
requests.post(""http://127.0.0.1:6666"", data=d)
</code></pre>

<p>this is what you get in the request body:</p>

<pre><code>a=123&amp;b=1&amp;b=2&amp;b=3
</code></pre>

<p>Since the test method post the data as a form, what you get from request.data is a QueryDict (the same as request.POST), hence you get the last value in the list when getting request.data. </p>

<p>To get expected behavior, post the data as JSON in the request body (as in @Vladir Parrado Cruz's answer). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>reload(module)</p>
  
  <p>Reload a previously imported module. The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before. This is
  useful if you have edited the module source file using an external
  editor and want to try out the new version without leaving the Python
  interpreter. The return value is the module object (the same as the
  module argument).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The argument must be a module object, so it must have been successfully imported before.</strong> When you do <code>from inputs import *</code> you actually has no module object in your namespace. Only module members.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When reload(module) is executed:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Python modules’ code is recompiled and the module-level code reexecuted, defining a new set of objects which are bound to names in
  the module’s dictionary. The init function of extension modules is not
  called a second time.</li>
  <li>As with all other objects in Python the old objects are only reclaimed after their reference counts drop to zero.</li>
  <li>The names in the module namespace are updated to point to any new or changed objects.</li>
  <li>Other references to the old objects (such as names external to the module) are not rebound to refer to the new objects and must be
  updated in each namespace where they occur if that is desired.</li>

<p>I remember reading, many years ago, that one of the improvements of ext3 over ext2 is keeping the pointer in the directory listing and beginning the next operation on that entry.

"31412540","2","31410640","<p>Here's an example using your provided 10x10 grid. It should give you the basic idea of how to implement this. </p>

<p>Just make sure you keep a reference to every <code>Checkbutton</code> (<code>boxes</code> in the example) as well as every <code>IntVar</code> (<code>boxVars</code> in the example).</p>

<p>Here's why:</p>

<p>-<code>Checkbuttons</code> are needed to call <code>config(state = DISABLED/NORMAL)</code>.</p>

<p>-<code>IntVars</code> are needed to determine the value of each <code>Checkbutton</code>.</p>

    # Check if enough buttons have been selected. If so, disable the deselected indeces,
    # Otherwise set all of them to active (in case we have previously disabled them).

    if len(deselected) == (len(row) - 2):

"31412868","2","31411330","<p>As @Foon pointed out, the canonical way to do this is to subtract a column.</p>

<p>However, on a side note, as your problem is overdetermined, you <em>have</em> to use a method such as least squares. By definition, if it's an overdetermined problem, there is no ""unique, exact solution"".  (Otherwise it would be even-determined - A square matrix.)</p>

<p>That aside, here's how you'd go about it:</p>

<p>Let's take your example equation:</p>

<pre><code>|1 0 0 1 0|     |n1|     |B1|
|1 0 0 0 1|     |n2|     |B2|
|0 1 0 1 0|  X  |n3|  =  |B3|
|0 1 0 0 1|     |t1|     |B4|
|0 0 1 1 0|     |t2|     |B5|
|0 0 1 0 1|              |B6|  
</code></pre>

<p>As you noted, this is overdetermined. If we know one of our ""model"" variables (let's say <code>n1</code> in this case), it will be even more overdetermined.  It's not a problem, but it means we'll need to use least squares, and there isn't a completely unique solution.</p>

<p>So, let's say we know what <code>n1</code> should be.</p>

<p>In that case, we'd re-state the problem by subtracting <code>n1</code> multiplied by the first column in the solution matrix from our vector of observations (This is what @Foon suggested):</p>

<pre><code>|0 0 1 0|     |n2|     |B1 - n1|
|0 0 0 1|     |n3|     |B2 - n1|
|1 0 1 0|  X  |t1|  =  |B3 - 0 |
|1 0 0 1|     |t2|     |B4 - 0 |
|0 1 1 0|              |B5 - 0 |
|0 1 0 1|              |B6 - 0 | 
</code></pre>

<p>Let's use a more concrete example in numpy terms.  Let's solve the equation <code>y = Ax^2 + Bx + C</code>.  To start with, let's generate our data and ""true"" model parameters:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np

# Randomly generate two of our model variables
a, c = np.random.rand(2)
b = 1
x = np.linspace(0, 2, 6)

y = a * x**2 + b * x + c
noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.1, y.size)
y += noise
</code></pre>

<p>First, we'll solve it _without) the knowledge that <code>B = 1</code>.  We could use <code>np.polyfit</code> for this, but to lead into the next bit, we'll use a lower-level approach:</p>

<pre><code># I'm a geophysist, so I tend to use Gm=d instead of Ax=b
G = np.column_stack([x**2, x, np.ones_like(x)])
d = y

m, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(G, d)

print ""Ideally, this would be 1: "", m[1]
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we'll get something close to, but not quite 1.  In this case (I didn't set the seed, so this will vary), the model parameters returned are</p>

<pre><code>[ 0.13392633,  0.97217035,  0.33645734]
</code></pre>

<p>While the true parameters are:</p>

<pre><code>[ 0.14592752,  1.        ,  0.31349185]
</code></pre>

<p>Now let's take the fact that we know <code>b</code> exactly into account.  We'll make a new <code>G</code> with one less column and subtract that column times <code>b</code> from our observations (<code>d</code>/<code>y</code>):</p>

<pre><code>G = np.column_stack([x**2, np.ones_like(x)])
d = y - b * x
m, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(G, d)

  <p>The advanced indexes are separated by a slice, ellipsis or newaxis. For example x[arr1, :, arr2].

<li>Initialize your BoF instance with the above BoF dictionary</li>
<li>Take one image from your training samples.</li>
<li>Extract SIFT keypoints</li>
<li>Find BoF descriptors for the extracted keypoints.</li>
<li>Use this BoF descriptor for the SVM learning</li>
<li>Do the above steps for all the training images</li>
<li>You will get a SVM classifier files in .xml form...save it</li>

<p>In my view this would be a better approach (if this is possible/reasonable in your case): You just call <code>some_method()</code> on your class, maybe without even knowing what exact type of object you're dealing with (regarding inheritance). The class itself knows what to do and reacts accordingly when its method has been called.</p>

"31429855","2","31429663","<p>Not sure whether it's any faster, but you could rewrite that code using <code>itertools.combinations</code> and get the <code>min</code> using a <code>key</code> function calculating the ""distance"". </p>

<p>If this does not help, you might consider temporarily turning the dictionaries in <code>_list</code> into lists, holding just the values of the relevant fields.

<p>The main limitation of multiprocessing is passing information. When a new process is spawned, an entire separate instance of the python interpreter is started with it's own independent memory allocation. The result of this is variables changed by one process won't be changed for other processes. For this functionality you need shared memory objects (also provided by multiprocessing module). One implementation I have done was a parent process that started several worker processes and passed them both an input queue, and an output queue. The function given to the child processes was a loop designed to do some calculations on the inputs pulled from the input queue and then spit them out to the output queue. I then designated a special input that the child would recognize to end the loop and terminate the process.</p>

<p>On your edit - Popen will start the other process in parallel, as will multiprocessing. If you need the child process to communicate with the executable, be sure to pass the file stream handles to the child process somehow.</p>

<p>First, the code you've posted has a number of errors in it (for example, you can't <code>connect</code> to <code>tcp://*:5555</code>), but I'll assume that it's representative of what you're trying to do.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to leave my original answer below, because I think it's
still useful although not directly relevant to your question (possibly
due to a morning caffeine deficit, who knows?).</p>

<p>Since your publisher is calling <code>send</code> with a single message and then
exiting immediately, the subscribers probably never have time to
<code>connect()</code>.  You would typically expect the code calling <code>bind</code> to be
the long-running process.  If you insert a <code>sleep</code> between the <code>bind</code>
and <code>send</code> call, things will work as expected:</p>

<pre><code>ctx = zmq.Context()
pub = ctx.socket(zmq.PUB)
pub.bind('tcp://*:5555')

time.sleep(1)
pub.send('message 1')
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine, assuming the following subscriber:</p>

<pre><code>ctx = zmq.Context()
sub = ctx.socket(zmq.SUB)
sub.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, '')
sub.connect('tcp://localhost:5555')

while True:
    msg = sub.recv()
    print msg
</code></pre>

<p>However, this isn't a great solution...anything using <code>sleep</code> for
synchronization is bound to fail.  A different way of solving this
would be to have your publisher open both a <code>PUB</code> socket and a <code>REP</code>
socket.  To send a message to all subscribers, your tool would open a
<code>REQ</code> socket to the broker, which would then publish it to all
subscribers.</p>

<hr>

<p>Original answer follows
</p>

<hr>

<p>The problem you're hitting is probably
<a href=""https://github.com/zeromq/netmq/issues/94"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.  Since you are
having your <em>subscriber</em> call <code>bind</code> and your sender call <code>connect</code>,
it is likely that your are simply losing the message because there is
a delay between a successful connection and the subscriber
successfully subscribing to messages.  Also see the question ""Why do I see
different behavior when I bind a socket versus connect a socket?"" in
<a href=""http://zeromq.org/area:faq#toc6"" rel=""nofollow"">the FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Demonstrating this with code, if we have this subscriber:</p>

<pre><code>ctx = zmq.Context()
sub = ctx.socket(zmq.SUB)
sub.setsockopt(zmq.SUBSCRIBE, '')
sub.bind('tcp://*:5555')

while True:
    msg = sub.recv()
    print msg
</code></pre>

<p>And the following publisher:</p>

<pre><code>ctx = zmq.Context()
pub = ctx.socket(zmq.PUB)
pub.connect('tcp://localhost:5555')

pub.send('message 1')
pub.send('message 2')
time.sleep(1)
pub.send('message 3')
</code></pre>

<p>The subscriber will probably always end up printing:</p>

<pre><code>message 3
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the first to <code>send</code> operations happen to quickly.</p>

<p>This is generally not considered a problem, since pub/sub is explicitly not a reliable transport mechanism.  In the typical use case, there is a single publisher calling <code>bind</code> and multiple subscribers calling <code>connect</code> that may not all be present initially or continuously.  There is no guarantee that every subscriber will receive every message.</p>

<p>If you need to reliably transport a single message, consider a <code>REQ</code>/<code>REP</code> socket pair instead.</p>

"31431839","2","31427649","<p>You are confused between media and static. Hopefully this will clarify the matter:</p>

<h2>Static Files</h2>

<p><em>Static files are files that are shipped as part of your application.</em></p>

<p><code>STATIC_ROOT</code> is where the <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/staticfiles/#django-admin-collectstatic"" rel=""nofollow""><code>collectstatic</code> command</a> will dump all static files, so you can move them to the production web server.</p>

<p>You don't need to mess with <code>STATIC_ROOT</code> during development.</p>

<hr>

<p>In your case, you have an application <em>Vote</em>, and inside it you have a <em>static</em> folder. That's all you need to serve static files during development. All you have to do is <code>{% static 'folder/filename.ext' %}</code> where <em>folder</em> is the folder inside static that contains your file.</p>

<p>So if your directory structure is:</p>

<pre><code>/Vote
 - __init__.py
 - migrations
 - admin.py
 - views.py
 - static
   - vote
     - images
       - foo.jpg
</code></pre>

<p>You need <code>&lt;img src=""{% static 'vote/images/foo.jpg' %}""&gt;</code></p>

<h2>Media Files</h2>

<p><em>Media files are what django calls files that are uploaded by your application's users</em></p>

<p>For uploading files, you need to set a location where all uploaded files are stored. This location is the parent directory and its universal across your entire project. The setting for this is <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#std:setting-MEDIA_ROOT"" rel=""nofollow""><code>MEDIA_ROOT</code></a>. This should be a <em>full system file path</em>.</p>

<p>Suppose you set <code>MEDIA_ROOT = '/home/foo/bar/proj/media'</code>, and in your models you have:</p>

<pre><code>image = models.ImageField(upload_to='logos/')
</code></pre>

<p>Files for the model will be uploaded to <code>/home/foo/bar/proj/media/logos/</code>.</p>

<p>To display these files, you need to tell django the name of a link that points to the <code>MEDIA_ROOT</code> directory, this setting is <code>MEDIA_URL</code>.</p>

<p>For development, you need to do three things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Set <code>MEDIA_URL</code> to <code>/media/</code></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/static-files/#serving-uploaded-files-in-development"" rel=""nofollow"">Configure <code>urls.py</code></a> to serve media files:</p>

<pre><code>urlpatterns = [

] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Import the modules from each other. This way they are both present as their namespace and will be filled during the import process.</p>

<p>So just do <code>import BBB</code> and use <code>BBB.BBB()</code> for instantiating the class:</p>

<pre><code>import BBB
class AAA():
    def test(self):
        print 'AAAA'
        a = BBB.BBB()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Do the import where you need it:</p>

<pre><code>class AAA():
    def test(self):
        from BBB import BBB
        print 'AAAA'
        a = BBB()
</code></pre>

<p>This way the link between the two modules is ""looser"" and not so tight.</p></li>

"31432111","2","31428581","<p>You program is probably failing in trying to load the entire dataset into RAM. 32 bits per float32 × 1,000,000 × 1000 is 3.7 GiB. That can be a problem on machines with only 4 GiB RAM. To check that it's actually the problem, try creating an array of this size alone:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.zeros((1000000, 1000), dtype=np.float32)
</code></pre>

<p>If you see a <code>MemoryError</code>, you either need more RAM, or you need to process your dataset one chunk at a time.</p>

<p>With h5py datasets we just should avoid passing the entire dataset to our methods, and pass slices of the dataset instead. One at a time.</p>

<p>As I don't have your data, let me start from creating a random dataset of the same size:</p>

<pre><code>import h5py
import numpy as np
h5 = h5py.File('rand-1Mx1K.h5', 'w')
h5.create_dataset('data', shape=(1000000,1000), dtype=np.float32)
for i in range(1000):
    h5['data'][i*1000:(i+1)*1000] = np.random.rand(1000, 1000)
h5.close()
</code></pre>

<p>It creates a nice 3.8 GiB file.</p>

<p>Now, if we are in Linux, we can limit how much memory is available to our program:</p>

<pre><code>$ bash
$ ulimit -m $((1024*1024*2))
$ ulimit -m
2097152
</code></pre>

<p>Now if we try to run your code, we'll get the MemoryError. (press Ctrl-D to quit the new bash session and reset the limit later)</p>

<p>Let's try to solve the problem. We'll create an IncrementalPCA object, and will call its <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.IncrementalPCA.html#sklearn.decomposition.IncrementalPCA.partial_fit"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>.partial_fit()</code></a> method many times, providing a different slice of the dataset each time.</p>

<pre><code>import h5py
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import IncrementalPCA

h5 = h5py.File('rand-1Mx1K.h5')
data = h5['data'] # it's ok, the dataset is not fetched to memory yet

n = data.shape[0] # how many rows we have in the dataset
chunk_size = 1000 # how many rows we feed to IPCA at a time, the divisor of n
icpa = IncrementalPCA(n_components=10, batch_size=16)

for i in range(0, n//chunk_size):
    ipca.partial_fit(data[i*chunk_size : (i+1)*chunk_size])

<ol>
<li>Read the csv-file. This can be done using the <code>csv</code> module for python</li>
<li>Read and/or convert the date stamps according to your bin size, and iterate through each line, adding to the correct hour bin. I just do it the dirty way and cut the minutes and seconds: <code>row[0][:-5]</code> returns <code>15/07/2015 11</code>, a date and hour to work with.</li>
</ol>

<p>You'll end up with a list <code>status_records</code> which consists of two dicts, representing the two status options, which then contain the hour bins:</p>

<li><code>""-11"" : {""15/07/2015 11"": 0, ...}</code></li>

        if hour not in status_records[status].keys():

print status1, status2

N = len(status1)
ind = np.arange(N)
width = 0.35

p1 = plt.bar(ind, status1, width, color='g')
p2 = plt.bar(ind, status2, width, color='r', bottom=status1)

plt.ylabel('# of exit status')

Basically if I try to share an X axis with two graphs, a line and bar graph, the first instantiated graph disappears.</p>

<p>The best way I can think to fix this is simply by doing two graphs on one (subplots) and hiding the X axis of the top graph. Here's what I did:</p>

        fig.subplots_adjust(hspace=0)
        pct.drop('Volume', axis=1).plot(ax=ax1)

"31495080","2","31486204","<p>From OP's comment I think the minimal solution a set of helper functions instead of classes.  the <a href=""https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict"" rel=""nofollow"">xmltodict</a> library makes it easy to turn the XML data into nested dictionaries, more or less like JSON.  A set of helpers that parse the contents and generate appropriate C-struct strings is all that's really needed.  If you can work with dictionaries :</p>

<pre><code> {  
    ""name"": ""my_struct"",
    ""members"": {
                  [
                    ""name"":  ""intmember"", 
                    ""ctype"": ""int""
                   },
                  {
                    ""name"":  ""floatmember"", 
                    ""ctype"": ""float""
                   }
                 ]                 
 }
</code></pre>

<p>You can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>from string import Template
struct_template_string = '''
typedef  $structname struct {
$defs
} $structname;
'''
struct_template = Template(struct_template_string)
member_template = Template(""    $ctype  $name;"")

def spec_to_struct(spec_dict):
    structname = spec_dict['name']
    member_data = spec_dict['members']
    members = [member_template.substitute(d) for d in member_data]
    return struct_template.substitute(structname = structname, defs = ""\n"".join(members))
</code></pre>

<p>Which will produce something like:</p>

<pre><code>typedef  my_struct struct {
   int  intmember;
   float  floatmember;
} my_struct;
</code></pre>

<p>I'd try to get it working with basic functions first before trying to build up a class scaffold. It would be pretty easy to hide the details in a class using property descriptors:</p>

<pre><code>class data_property(object):
    def __init__(self, path, wrapper = None):
        self.path = path
        self.wrapper = wrapper

    def __get__(self, instance, owner):
        result =  instance[self.path]
        if self.wrapper:
            if hasattr(result, '__iter__'):
                return [self.wrapper(**i) for i in result]
            return self.wrapper(**result)
        return result

class MemberWrapper(dict):
    name = data_property('name')
    type = data_property('ctype')

class StructWrapper(dict):

      name = data_property('name')
      members = data_property('members', MemberWrapper )


test = StructWrapper(**example)

print test.name
print test.members
for member in test.members:
    print member.type, member.name

# my_struct

<p>For this problem, there's really not much point to special casing the last two items in the list. You can make your code much simpler by handling all the cases with one loop:</p>

<pre><code>def has22(nums):
    for n in range(len(nums) - 1):   # the loop body will not run if len(nums) &lt; 2
        if nums[n] == nums[n + 1] == 2:   # you can chain comparison operators

    return False   # this is at top level (after the loop), not an `else` clause of the if

<p>As the comment says, the loop body where I use list indexes won't run if the length of the list is less than 2. That's because the <code>range</code> will be empty, and iterating on an empty sequence does nothing.</p>

<pre><code> xdiff = x[1:] - x[:-1]
</code></pre>

<p>is much faster than</p>

<pre><code> xdiff = np.zeros(x.shape[0]-1)
 for i in range(x.shape[0]:
     xdiff[i] = x[i+1] - x[i]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>np.nditer</code> isn't any faster.</p>

<p><code>nditer</code> is recommended as a general iteration tool in compiled code.  But its main value lies in handling broadcasting and coordinating the iteration over several arrays (input/output).  And you need to use buffering and <code>c</code> like code to get the best speed from <code>nditer</code> (I'll look up a recent SO question).</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/39058906/901925"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39058906/901925</a></p>

<p>Don't use <code>nditer</code> without studying the relevant <code>iteration</code> tutorial page (the one that ends with a <code>cython</code> example).</p>

<p>=========================</p>

<p>Just judging from experience, this approach will be fastest.  Yes it's going to iterate over <code>secaxis</code> a number of times, but those are all done in compiled code, and will be much faster than any iteration in Python.  And the <code>for f in X:</code> iteration is just a few times.</p>

<pre><code>res = []
inds, = numpy.where((secaxis[:-1] &lt; 0) * (secaxis[1:] &gt; 0) +
                   (secaxis[:-1] &gt; 0) * (secaxis[1:] &lt; 0))
coefs = -secaxis[inds] / secaxis[inds+1] # array of coefficients
for f in X: 
    res.append( (f[inds] + coefs*f[inds+1]) / (1+coefs) )
</code></pre>

<p><code>@HYRY</code> has explored alternatives for making the <code>where</code> step faster.  But as you can see the differences aren't that big.  Other possible tweaks</p>

<pre><code>inds1 = inds+1
coefs = -secaxis[inds] / secaxis[inds1]
coefs1 = coefs+1
for f in X:
    res.append(( f[inds] + coefs*f[inds1]) / coefs1)
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>X</code> was an array, <code>res</code> could be an array as well.</p>

<pre><code>res = (X[:,inds] + coefs*X[:,inds1])/coefs1
</code></pre>

<p>But for small <code>N</code> I suspect the list <code>res</code> is just as good.  Don't need to make the arrays any bigger than necessary.  The tweaks are minor, just trying to avoid recalculating things.</p>

<p>=================</p>

<p>This use of <code>np.where</code> is just <code>np.nonzero</code>.  That actually makes two passes of the array, once with <code>np.count_nonzero</code> to determine how many values it will return, and create the return structure (list of arrays of now known length).  And a second loop to fill in those indices.  So multiple iterations are fine if it keeps action simple.</p>

<p>There is a glitch in the original.  The product is appended to the end, but the first number matching the product from the front is replaced.  I believe that the result could be omission of expressions, in which case the algorithm is not complete.  Since replace cannot be done starting at the end, the product should be placed at the front (<code>subnumbers.insert(0, product)</code>) so that it is the product that gets replaced.  I will let you experiment with what difference this makes.  But I believe the code would have been slightly easier to understand if written correctly.</p>

"39187760","2","39186182","<p>The question you are asking -- about what happens when -- relates to events that occur upstream of Flask...like when gunicorn starts up.</p>

<p>Flask is a <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/"" rel=""nofollow"">Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) application framework</a>. WSGI is a Python-specific framework that defines how a web server will interface with an application. (The Java equivalent is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_servlet"" rel=""nofollow"">Java servlet</a>.)
The server will use Python's WSGI protocol to call Flask when appropriate. The Flask documentation on <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/deploying/wsgi-standalone/"" rel=""nofollow"">deploying a standalone WSGI application</a> shows how to set this up manually, and gives you a little insight into what's going on upstream of Flask.
The section on Gevent is useful because it explicitly shows the import statement for <code>yourapplication</code> and its relationship to the HTTP server: </p>

<pre><code>from gevent.wsgi import WSGIServer
from yourapplication import app  # if yourapplication imports from views,
                                 # the sort would happen once; here.

http_server = WSGIServer(('', 5000), app)
http_server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href=""https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/blob/master/gunicorn/app/wsgiapp.py"" rel=""nofollow"">source code for gunicorn</a> shows a similar approach, loading the WSGI application once per worker, and then running indefinitely.</p>

<h2>... Flask's application context</h2>

<p>But you may be searching for a way to create some new variable or instantiate a new database connection or establish a unique session cookie -- things that should occur every time a request is processed, and not just once when the application code is loaded.  For this, you should look into Flask's <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/appcontext/"" rel=""nofollow"">application context</a>. From the cited page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The application context is created and destroyed as necessary. It never moves
  between threads and it will not be shared between requests. As such it is the
  perfect place to store database connection information and other things.</p>

"39188199","2","39187952","<p>There are couple of issues with the code. First since you're using <code>long</code> I guess you're running it on Python 2.

"39188237","2","39187040","<p>Multiple inheritance in Python requires that all the classes cooperate to make it work. In this case, you can make them cooperate by having the <code>__init__</code> method in each class accept arbitrary <code>**kwargs</code> and pass them on when they call <code>super().__init__</code>.</p>

<p>For your example class hierarchy, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>class A(object):
    __init__(self,a):  # Don't accept **kwargs here! Any extra arguments are an error!
        self.a=a

class B(A):
    __init__(self, b, **kwargs):  # only name the arg we care about (the rest go in **kwargs)
        super(B, self).__init__(**kwargs)  # pass on the other keyword args
        self.b=b

class C(A):
    __init__(self, c1, c2, **kwargs):
        super(C,self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.c1=c1
        self.c2=c2

class D(B,C)
    __init__(self, d, **kwargs):
        super(D,self).__init__(**kwargs)
        self.d=d
        self.dd=self.a+self.b+2*self.c1+5*self.c2+3*self.d
</code></pre>

<p>Note that if you wanted <code>D</code> to use the argument values directly (rather than using <code>self.a</code>, etc.), you could both take them as named arguments and still pass them on in the <code>super()</code> call:</p>

<pre><code>class D(B,C)
    __init__(self,a, b, c1, c2, d, **kwargs): # **kwargs in case there's further inheritance
        super(D,self).__init__(a=a, b=b, c1=c1, c2=c2, **kwargs)
        self.d = d
        self.dd = a + b + 2 * c1 + 5 * c2 + 3 * d   # no `self` needed in this expression!
</code></pre>

<p>Accepting and passing on some args is important if some of the parent classes don't save the arguments (in their original form) as attributes, but you need those values. You can also use this style of code to pass on modified values for some of the arguments (e.g. with <code>super(D, self).__init__(a=a, b=b, c1=2*c1, c2=5*c2, **kwargs)</code>).</p>

<p>This kind of collaborative multiple inheritance with varying arguments is almost impossible to make work using positional arguments. With keyword arguments though, the order of the names and values in a call doesn't matter, so it's easy to pass on named arguments and <code>**kwargs</code> at the same time without anything breaking. Using <code>*args</code> doesn't work as well (though recent versions of Python 3 are more flexible about how you can call functions with <code>*args</code>, such as allowing multiple unpackings in a single call: <code>f(*foo, bar, *baz)</code>).</p>

<p>If you were using Python 3 (I'm assuming not, since you're explicitly passing arguments to <code>super</code>), you could make the arguments to your collaborative functions ""keyword-only"", which would prevent users from getting very mixed up and trying to call your methods with positional arguments. Just put a bare <code>*</code> in the argument list before the other named arguments: <code>def __init__(self, *, c1, c2, **kwargs):</code>.</p>

"39190134","2","39186716","<p>After your <code>Dialog</code> is closed, and the <code>popup</code> variable referencing it goes out of scope, Python will garbage-collect it.  This causes the entire underlying C++ object, including all of its sub-widgets and layouts, to be deleted. However, you're keeping a reference to a layout used by the dialog, and hence the layout will have been deleted by the second time you try to open the dialog.</p>

<p>I find it odd that you're doing all of the initialization of your <code>Dialog</code> class outside of the <code>Dialog</code> class.  Instead, I would recommend moving the creation of <code>popLayout</code>, and all of the creation and setup of <code>table</code>, inside your <code>Dialog</code> class. This way the layout gets created each time the dialog is opened.</p>

<p>You'll need to add <code>gameResults</code> as a parameter to the <code>__init__</code> method of <code>Dialog</code>, and you can also remove the <code>layout</code> parameter you have there at the moment because it isn't used.  </p>

<p>After doing this, your <code>Dialog</code> class should look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Dialog(QDialog):
    def __init__(self, flags, gameResults):
        super().__init__()
        self.setWindowFlags(flags)    
        self.resize(800,500)

        table.setColumnCount(2);
        table.setHorizontalHeaderItem(0, QTableWidgetItem(""Game""))
        table.setHorizontalHeaderItem(1, QTableWidgetItem(""URL""))
        for index, game in enumerate(sorted(gameResults)):
            table.setItem(index,0,QTableWidgetItem(game))
            table.item(index,0).setFlags( Qt.ItemIsSelectable |  Qt.ItemIsEnabled )
            table.setItem(index,1,QTableWidgetItem('http://store.steampowered.com/app/'+gameResults[game]+'/'))
            table.item(index,1).setFlags( Qt.ItemIsSelectable |  Qt.ItemIsEnabled )
        table.resizeColumnsToContents()
</code></pre>

<p>and your <code>doStuff()</code> method should look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>def doStuff():
    gameResults = {'doom' : '111232', 'quake' : '355324'}
    if len(gameResults) &gt; 0:
        popup = Dialog((Qt.WindowSystemMenuHint | Qt.WindowTitleHint), gameResults)

    else:
        msgBox = QMessageBox()
        msgBox.setText(""No results."")
        msgBox.exec_()

<p>I made these changes to your code and I was able to open the dialog multiple times.  </p>

<p>I'll leave it up to you to move your main window set-up code inside your <code>Window</code> class in the same way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ValueError: pos_label=1 is not a valid label: array(['ham', 'spam'], 
        dtype='|S4')</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're trying to score your model with precision and recall.  Recall that these scoring methods are formulated in terms of true positives, false positives, and false negatives.  But how does <code>sklearn</code> know what is positive and what is negative?  Is it 'ham' or 'spam'?  We need a way to tell <code>sklearn</code> that we consider 'spam' the positive label and 'ham' the negative label.  According to the <code>sklearn</code> documentation, the precision and recall scorers by default expect a positive label of <code>1</code>, hence the <code>pos_label=1</code> part of the error message.</p>

<p>There are at least 3 ways to go about fixing this.</p>

<p><b>1. Encode 'ham' and 'spam' values as 0 and 1 directly from the data source in order to accommodate the precision/recall scorers:</b></p>

<pre><code># Map dataframe to encode values and put values into a numpy array
encoded_labels = df['label'].map(lambda x: 1 if x == 'spam' else 0).values # ham will be 0 and spam will be 1

# Continue as normal
X_train_raw, X_test_raw, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['message'], encoded_labels)
</code></pre>

<p><b>2. Use <code>sklearn</code>'s built-in function (<code>label_binarize</code>) to transform the categorical data into encoded integers in order to accommodate precision/recall scorers: </b></p>

<p>This will transform your categorical data to integers.</p>

<pre><code># Encode labels
from sklearn.preprocessing import label_binarize
encoded_column_vector = label_binarize(df['label'], classes=['ham','spam']) # ham will be 0 and spam will be 1
encoded_labels = np.ravel(encoded_column_vector) # Reshape array

# Continue as normal
X_train_raw, X_test_raw, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['message'], encoded_labels)
</code></pre>

<p><b> 3. Create scorer objects with custom arguments for <code>pos_label</code>:</b></p>

<p>As the documentation says, the precision and recall scores by default have a <code>pos_label</code> argument of <code>1</code>, but this can be changed to inform the scorer which string represents the positive label.  You can construct scorer objects that have different arguments with <code>make_scorer</code>.</p>

<pre><code># Start out as you did originally with string labels
X_train_raw, X_test_raw, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['message'], df['label'])
# Fit classifier as normal ...


# Get precision and recall
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, make_scorer
# Precision
precision_scorer = make_scorer(precision_score, pos_label='spam')
precisions = cross_val_score(classifier, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring=precision_scorer)
print 'Precision', np.mean(precisions), precisions

# Recall
recall_scorer = make_scorer(recall_score, pos_label='spam')
recalls = cross_val_score(classifier, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring=recall_scorer)
print 'Recalls', np.mean(recalls), recalls

<p><strong>EDITED</strong></p>

<p>Here if the full model</p>

<pre><code>with pmc.Model() as model_1:

# constants
aP, bP = 1., 1.

# Pseudo- and true hyperpriors per model
a0 = tt.as_tensor([aP, .48*500])    
b0 = tt.as_tensor([bP, (1-.48)*500])

# Lower level pseudo- and true priors per model/condition combination
a = tt.as_tensor(np.c_[[(.40*125), (.50*125), (.51*125), (.52*125)], np.tile(aP, 4)])
b = tt.as_tensor(np.c_[[((1-.40)*125), ((1-.50)*125), ((1-.51)*125), ((1-.52)*125)], np.tile(bP, 4)])

# Prior on model index [0,1]
m_idx = pmc.Categorical('m_idx', p=np.array([.5, .5]))

# Priors on concentration parameters
kappa = pmc.Gamma('kappa', 2.618, 0.0809, shape=nCond)

# omega0 
omega0 = pmc.Beta('omega0', a0[m_idx], b0[m_idx])    

# omega (condition specific)
omega = pmc.Beta('omega', a[:,m_idx], b[:,m_idx], shape=nCond)

# theta
aBeta = pmc.switch(pmc.eq(m_idx, 0), omega0 * kappa+1, omega * kappa+1)
bBeta = pmc.switch(pmc.eq(m_idx, 0), (1-omega0) * kappa+1, (1-omega) * kappa+1)

theta = pmc.Beta('theta', aBeta, bBeta, shape=nCond)

# Likelihood
y = pmc.Binomial('y', n=df.nTrlOfSubj.values, p=theta[cond_idx], observed=df.nCorrOfSubj)
trace = pmc.sample(1000)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that your code had several issues, like missing parenthesis in the definition of the variable <code>b</code> and the order of the prior and pseudopriors was inverted. Additionally I change the code in ordet to let <code>aBeta</code>, <code>bBeta</code> and <code>theta</code>have shape=nCond, and then in the likellihood define <code>p</code> as <code>p=theta[cond_idx]</code>. </p>

<p>I did not check the results against Kruschke's book, but the trace look reasonable.</p>

"39200393","2","39200256","<p>Here's one unstable way to do it:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; l2 = ['a', 'a b c', 'abc zyx', 'ab cc ac']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [s for _, s in sorted(((sum(s2.count(s1) for s1 in l1), s2) for s2 in l2), reverse=True)]
['ab cc ac', 'abc zyx', 'a b c', 'a']
</code></pre>

<p>If stable sort is required you could leverage <code>enumerate</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
&gt;&gt;&gt; l2 = ['a', 'a b c', 'ccc ccc', 'bb bb bb', 'aa aa aa']
&gt;&gt;&gt; [x[-1] for x in sorted(((sum(s2.count(s1) for s1 in l1), -i, s2) for i, s2 in enumerate(l2)), reverse=True)]
['ccc ccc', 'bb bb bb', 'aa aa aa', 'a b c', 'a']
</code></pre>

<p>Above generates tuples where second item is a string from <code>l2</code> and first item is the count of matches from <code>l1</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tuples = [(sum(s2.count(s1) for s1 in l1), s2) for s2 in l2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; tuples
[(1, 'a'), (3, 'a b c'), (3, 'abc zyx'), (6, 'ab cc ac')]

<p>Then those tuples are sorted to descending order:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt; tuples
[(6, 'ab cc ac'), (3, 'abc zyx'), (3, 'a b c'), (1, 'a')]

<p>And finally only the strings are taken:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; [s for _, s in tuples]
['ab cc ac', 'abc zyx', 'a b c', 'a']
</code></pre>

<p>In the second version tuples have reverse index to ensure stability:</p>

<p>If you're using this type of software, one hack around could be doing print('\n' * 100), it won't be the optimal solution but it's better than nothing.</p>

The following function <code>pred()</code> (short for ""predecessor"") returns the key of the item whose duration is the largest duration &lt;= the passed duration. It returns <code>None</code> (which can be tested for) if the passed duration is smaller than all of the durations in the dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>from bisect import bisect_left

def pred(duration, entries):
    entries = list(entries.items())
    entries.sort(key = lambda x: x[1]['duration'])
    durations = [x[1]['duration'] for x in entries]
    j = bisect_left(durations,duration)
    if j == 0:
        return None
    else:
        return entries[j-1][0]

'10': {'auth': '10', 'duration': 132.72},
'4': {'auth': '4', 'duration': 144.59}
}

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; rank(133.92,d)

<p><strong>Final Edit</strong>: At the cost of some readability, here is a 1-liner:</p>

<pre><code>In [108]: [i for i,v in enumerate(a) if tuple(v) in b]
Out[108]: [0, 2]
</code></pre>

<p>basically the same speed as the <code>filter</code> approach:</p>

<pre><code>In [111]: timeit [i for i,v in enumerate(a) if tuple(v) in b]
10000 loops, best of 3: 24.5 µs per loop

In [114]: timeit list(filter(lambda x: tuple(a[x]) in b, range(len(a))))
10000 loops, best of 3: 29.7 µs per loop
</code></pre>

<p>But this is a toy example, so timings aren't meaningful.</p>

<p>If <code>a</code> wasn't already an array, these list approaches would be faster than the array ones, due to the overhead of creating arrays.</p>

<p>There are some numpy set operations, but they work with 1d arrays.  We can get around that by converting 2d arrays to 1d structured.</p>

<pre><code>In [117]: a.view('i,i')
Out[117]: 
array([[(1, 2)],
       [(3, 4)],
       [(6, 4)],
       [(5, 3)],
       [(3, 5)]], 
      dtype=[('f0', '&lt;i4'), ('f1', '&lt;i4')])
In [119]: np.array(list(b),'i,i')
Out[119]: 
array([(1, 2), (6, 4), (9, 9)], 
      dtype=[('f0', '&lt;i4'), ('f1', '&lt;i4')])

<p>There is a version of this using <code>np.void</code>, but it's easier to remember and play with this 'i,i' dtype.</p>

<p>So this works:</p>

<pre><code>In [123]: np.nonzero(np.in1d(a.view('i,i'),np.array(list(b),'i,i')))[0]
Out[123]: array([0, 2], dtype=int32)

<p>but it is much slower than the iterations:</p>

10000 loops, best of 3: 153 µs per loop

<p>As discussed in other recent <code>union</code> questions, <code>np.in1d</code> uses several strategies.  One is based on broadcasting and <code>where</code>.  The other uses <code>unique</code>, <code>concatenation</code>, <code>sorting</code> and differences.</p>

<p>Now, if the list is less than 4, then automatically the check will fail:</p>

<pre><code>if len(arr) &lt; 4:
  return false
</code></pre>

<p>Next, you need to check if the first four items contain nine. There are many ways to do this, one of the easiest is:</p>

  for i in arr[:4]:
    if i == '9':
       return true

<p>The issue with your initial approach is you are forcing the length to be 4, and assuming that at minimum the array will have 4 elements. If the array has 3 elements, then your code will not work.</p>

<p>To avoid this, don't assume a specific length. If you use slicing, then you are guaranteed that you will get <em>at most 4</em> items.</p>

<p>Here is an example of this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = [1,2]
&gt;&gt;&gt; i[:4]
[1, 2]

<p>Even though <code>i</code> only has two items, the slice to 4 works and doesn't raise an error. Once <code>i</code> has more than 4 items, it will limit to the first four:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; i = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
&gt;&gt;&gt; i[:4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>However, our problem statement specifically said that check if the first four items contain 9. If we just use the slice trick, like this:</p>

<pre><code>for i in arr[:4]:
    if i == '9':
       return true
</code></pre>

<p>It will return true even if we pass it an array like <code>['1','9']</code> since the slice will always work.</p>

<p>To catch this condition - we first check if the length of the list is less than 4, because if it is - it automatically fails the condition.</p>

"39221462","2","39219722","<p><strong>Solution</strong>: you have <code>__all__</code> set to empty list i.e. <code>from package import *</code> basically imports nothing</p>

<p>set it to <code>__all__ = ['submodule']</code> in <code>__init__.py</code></p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>What exactly is <strong>__all__</strong> ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In simplest words <strong>all</strong> help customizing the <code>from package import *</code> i.e. with <strong>all</strong> we can set what will be imported and what not.</p>

<p><strong>From the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-import-statement"" rel=""nofollow"">docs</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The public names defined by a module are determined by checking the
  module’s namespace for a variable named <strong>all</strong>; if defined, it must
  be a sequence of strings which are names defined or imported by that
  module. The names given in <strong>all</strong> are all considered public and are
  required to exist. If <strong>all</strong> is not defined, the set of public names
  includes all names found in the module’s namespace which do not begin
  with an underscore character ('_'). <strong>all</strong> should contain the entire
  public API. It is intended to avoid accidentally exporting items that
  are not part of the API (such as library modules which were imported
  and used within the module).</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>One important thing to note here is - <strong>Imports without <code>*</code> are not affected by <code>__all__</code></strong> i.e. Members that are not mentioned in <code>__all__</code> are accessible from outside the module using direct import - <code>from &lt;module&gt; import &lt;member&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>An Example</strong>: the following code in a <code>module.py</code> explicitly exports the symbols <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>:</p>

<pre><code>__all__ = ['foo', 'bar']

waz = 5
foo = 10
def bar(): return 'bar'
</code></pre>

<p>These symbols can then be imported like so:</p>

<pre><code>from foo import *

print foo
print bar

# now import `waz` will trigger an exception, 
# as it is not in the `__all__`, hence not a public member.
print waz

<p><strong>Note:</strong> </p>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_curve.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>roc_curve documentation</code></a>, it is clearly stated that thresholds[0] represents no instances being predicted and is arbitrarily set to <code>max(pred)+1</code>.
[Here, 2 for binary classification task]</p>

<p>This becomes valid when the <code>fpr</code> and <code>tpr</code> when calculated becomes a fraction and cannot be quantified to 0 or 1. Hence, the <code>threshold</code> varies from 0, 1, 2.
For eg, when the last 2 values of <code>pred</code> array become 1, you get 3 values for threshold as <code>fpr</code> and <code>tpr</code> become fractional values.</p>

<p>But in our case, both <code>fpr</code> and <code>tpr</code> had been either of 0 or 1 and hence there wasn't any need for a third value of the <code>threshold</code>.</p>

<p>Also, the array elements in both <code>fpr</code> and <code>tpr</code> form an increasing sequence, i.e vary from  0 →1 and must satisfy a shape >= 2. Therefore, it is mandatory to have both 0's and 1's in the array as the starting and terminal values.</p>

<p>Incase of fractional values of <code>fpr</code> and <code>tpr</code>, the middle column would contain these values enclosed by 0 and 1 on either side of the array.</p>

"39223350","2","39220120","<p>The easiest answer to any Python in-memory search-for question is ""use a dict"". Dicts give O(ln N) key-access speed, lists give O(N).</p>

<p>Also remember that you can put a Python object into as many dicts (or lists), and as many times into one dict or list, as it takes. They are not copied. It's just a reference.</p>

"39226689","2","39220929","<p>Scipy implements standard N-dimensional convolutions, so that the matrix to be convolved and the kernel are both N-dimensional.</p>

<p>A quick fix would be to add an extra dimension to <code>Y</code> so that <code>Y</code> is 3-Dimensional:</p>

<pre><code>result = signal.convolve(X, Y[..., None], 'valid')
</code></pre>

<p>I'm assuming here that the last axis corresponds to the image index as in your example <code>[width, height, image_idx]</code> (or <code>[height, width, image_idx]</code>). If it is the other way around and the images are indexed in the first axis (as it is more common in C-ordering arrays) you should replace <code>Y[..., None]</code> with <code>Y[None, ...]</code>.</p>

<p>The line <code>Y[..., None]</code> will add an extra axis to <code>Y</code>, making it 3-dimensional <code>[kernel_width, kernel_height, 1]</code> and thus, converting it to a valid 3-Dimensional convolution kernel.</p>

<p>NOTE: This assumes that all your input mini-batches have the same <code>width x height</code>, which is standard in CNN's.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: Some timings as @Divakar suggested.</p>

<p>The testing framework is setup as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def test(S, N, K):
    """""" S: image size, N: num images, K: kernel size""""""
    a = np.random.randn(S, S, N)
    b = np.random.randn(K, K)
    valid = [slice(K//2, -K//2+1), slice(K//2, -K//2+1)]

    %timeit signal.convolve(a, b[..., None], 'valid')
    %timeit signal.fftconvolve(a, b[..., None], 'valid')
    %timeit ndimage.convolve(a, b[..., None])[valid]
</code></pre>

<p>Find bellow tests for different configurations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Varying image size <code>S</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test(100, 50, 11) # 100x100 images

1 loop, best of 3: 1min 51s per loop
1 loop, best of 3: 16.5 s per loop
1 loop, best of 3: 5.66 s per loop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Varying number of images <code>N</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test(100, 5, 11) # 5 images
10 loops, best of 3: 90.7 ms per loop
10 loops, best of 3: 26.7 ms per loop
100 loops, best of 3: 5.7 ms per loop

&gt;&gt;&gt; test(100, 500, 11) # 500 images
1 loop, best of 3: 9.75 s per loop
1 loop, best of 3: 888 ms per loop
1 loop, best of 3: 727 ms per loop
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Varying kernel size <code>K</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; test(100, 50, 5) # 5x5 kernels
1 loop, best of 3: 217 ms per loop
10 loops, best of 3: 100 ms per loop

"39238424","2","39218781","<p>The linear increase is very much normal, if the database has to process your queries sequentially. Essentially, all concurrent requests get started at the same time, but finish one after another, so, assuming a pool with a single connection, 60ms per request, and 10 concurrent requests, you're going to see requests taking 60ms, 120ms, 180ms, 240ms, 300ms, 360ms, 420ms, 480ms, 540ms, 600ms, 600ms, ..., 600ms, 540ms, 480ms, ... . We can calculate how much time it takes for the average request, given <code>n</code> requests and <code>m</code> concurrent requests:</p>

<pre><code>f(n, m) = 60ms * (((m + 1) * m / 2) * 2 + (n - 2m) * m) / n

<p>These numbers are similar to what you are seeing.</p>

<p>Now comes the big question. Why does the database process queries almost sequentially? I can think of a few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Locking: each started transaction needs to lock some resource exclusively so only one (or few) transaction can run at a time</li>
<li>CPU-bound query: each transaction takes significant CPU resources so other transactions must wait for CPU time</li>
<li>Large table scans: the database cannot keep the entirety of the table in memory and therefore must read from disk for every transaction</li>
</ul>

<p>How do you fix this? This is a complicated question, but a few potential solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optimize your queries; either optimize it so that they don't all fight for the same resource, or, optimize it so that they don't take as long</li>
<li>Batch your queries so that you need to run fewer in total</li>
<li>Cache your responses so that they don't hit the database at all</li>

<p>In this case it is clearer to use the <code>:i</code> indexing, and adjust the <code>range</code> accordingly:</p>

<p>But first lets put <code>relationships</code> into a format that is easier to use, prehaps a <code>back_populates:label</code> dictionary?</p>

<pre><code>conversions = {d[""back_populates""]:d['label'] for d in relationships}
</code></pre>

<p>Next because we will be using <code>itertools.groupby</code> it will need a <code>keyfunc</code> to distinguish between the different groups of entries.
So given one entry from the initial <code>results</code>, this function will return a dictionary with only the pairs that will not be condensed/converted</p>

<pre><code>def grouper(entry):
    #each group is identified by all key:values that are not identified in conversions
    return {k:v for k,v in entry.items() if k not in conversions}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we will be able to traverse the <code>results</code> in groups something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for base_info, group in itertools.groupby(old_results, grouper):
    #base_info is dict with info unique to all entries in group
    for partial in group:
        #partial is one entry from results that will contribute to the final result
        #but wait, what do we add it too?
</code></pre>

<p>The only issue is that if we build our <code>entry</code> from <code>base_info</code> it will confuse <code>groupby</code> so we need to make an <code>entry</code> to work with:</p>

<pre><code>entry = {new_field:set() for new_field in conversions.values()}
entry.update(base_info)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I am using <code>set</code>s here because they are the natural container when all contence are unique,
however because it is not json-compatible we will need to change them into lists at the end.</p>

<p>Now that we have an entry to build we can just iterate through the <code>group</code> to <code>add</code> to each <code>new</code> field from the <code>original</code></p>

<pre><code>for partial in group:
    for original, new in conversions.items():
        entry[new].add(partial[original])
</code></pre>

<p>then once the final entry is constructed all that is left is to convert the <code>set</code>s back into <code>list</code>s</p>

<pre><code>for new in conversions.values():
    entry[new] = list(entry[new])
</code></pre>

<p>And that entry is done, now we can either <code>append</code> it to a list called <code>new_results</code> but since this process is essentially <em>generating</em> results it would make more sense to put it into a <code>generator</code>
making the final code look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

results = [
    {'pk': 1, 'name': 'Joe', 'permission': 'user', 'address': 'home'},
    {'pk': 1, 'name': 'Joe', 'permission': 'user', 'address': 'work'},
    {'pk': 1, 'name': 'Joe', 'permission': 'admin', 'address': 'home'},
    {'pk': 1, 'name': 'Joe', 'permission': 'admin', 'address': 'work'},
    {'pk': 2, 'name': 'John', 'permission': 'user', 'address': 'home'},
]

relationships = [
    {'label': 'permissions', 'back_populates': 'permission'},
    {'label': 'addresses', 'back_populates': 'address'},
]
#first we put the ""relationships"" in a format that is much easier to use.
conversions = {d[""back_populates""]:d['label'] for d in relationships}

def grouper(entry):
    #each group is identified by all key:values that are not identified in conversions
    return {k:v for k,v in entry.items() if k not in conversions}

def parse_results(old_results, conversions=conversions):
    for base_info, group in itertools.groupby(old_results, grouper):
        entry = {new_field:set() for new_field in conversions.values()}
        entry.update(base_info)
        for partial in group: #for each entry in the original results set
            for original, new in conversions.items(): #for each field that will be condensed
                entry[new].add(partial[original])


        #convert sets back to lists so it can be put back into json
        for new in conversions.values():
            entry[new] = list(entry[new])

        yield entry

<p>There are several answers but I though I'd add one using iterators. If changing in place is acceptable, that's going to be fastest. If you don't want to change the original and just want to loop over a filtered set, this should be pretty fast:</p>

<p>Implementation:</p>

<pre><code>def without(iterable, remove_indices):
    """"""
    Returns an iterable for a collection or iterable, which returns all items except the specified indices.
    """"""
    if not hasattr(remove_indices, '__iter__'):
        remove_indices = {remove_indices}
    else:
        remove_indices = set(remove_indices)
    for k, item in enumerate(iterable):
        if k in remove_indices:
            continue
        yield item
</code></pre>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>li = list(range(5))
without(li, 3)             
# &lt;generator object without at 0x7f6343b7c150&gt;
list(without(li, (0, 2)))  
# [1, 3, 4]
list(without(li, 3))       
# [0, 1, 2, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>So it is a generator - you'll need to call <code>list</code> or something to make it permanent.</p>

<p>I like this solution because there are no separate lookup tables. The regular expression to match on is embedded in the method to be called as an annotation. For me, this is as it should be. It would be nice if Python allowed more flexible annotations, because I would rather put the regex annotation on the method itself rather than embed it in the method parameter list. However, this isn't possible at the moment.</p>

<p>For interest, take a look at the Wolfram language in which functions are polymorphic on arbitrary patterns, not just on argument types. A function that is polymorphic on a regex is a very powerful idea, but we can't get there cleanly in Python. The RegexDispatcher class is the best I could do.</p>

<pre><code>def partition(pred, iterable):

[list(c) for c in children]
# [['A', 'B', 'Z', 'Y'], ['b', 'x', 'p']]

<p>Here <code>partition</code> uses a predicate function to determine if each item in an iterable is lowercase.  If not, it is filtered into the false group.  Otherwise, it is filtered into the group of true items.  We iterate to expose these groups.</p>

<p><strong>Even and Odd Indices</strong></p>

<p>You can modify this to work for odd and even indices as well:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it

children = mit.partition(pred, tuple(zip(it.count(), iterable)))

"46339879","2","23559765","<p>The other answers are good for the specific case where you can avoid raising the exception in the first place. The more general case where the exception cannot be avoided can be handled a lambda function as follows:</p>

<pre><code>def test(expression, exception_list, on_exception):
    try:
        return expression()
    except exception_list:
        return on_exception

if test(lambda: some_function(data), SomeException, None) is None:
    report_error('Something happened')

<p>The key point here is that making it a lambda defers evaluation of the expression that might raise an exception until inside the try/except block of the <code>test()</code> function where it can be caught. <code>test()</code> returns either the result of the evaluation, or, if an exception in <code>exception_list</code> is raised, the <code>on_exception</code> value.</p>

"39829434","2","39240463","<p>My solution was to set up the module like this:</p>

<pre><code>my_module

    - b.py

    cython_my_module
        - __init_.py
        - b.pyx

<p>The <code>setup.py</code> would contain something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

import numpy

setup(
    name='My_module',
    ext_modules=cythonize([""cython_my_module/b.pyx"",]),
    include_dirs=[numpy.get_include()],
)

<p>and the file <code>a.py</code> would contain the following lines in the header:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    import cython_my_module.b
except ImportError:
    import b
</code></pre>

<p>The way it works is very simple: if you don't do anything (i.e. if you don't compile the cython files) then module <code>a.py</code> imports module <code>b.py</code>; however, if you run <code>python setup.py build_ext --inplace</code> then the compiled cython files will appear inside <code>cython_my_module</code> and the next time you run <code>a.py</code> it will automatically import the cython module <code>b.pyx</code> (actually it will import the compiled library <code>b.so</code>).</p>

<p>So far it seems to work and requires almost no effort. Hope it helps.</p>

The numpy array itself is saved somewhere in the callback.  You could save it as a Python global, or more cleanly use a ""handle"" you pass via C.  Requires the API version, not the ABI.  In _example_build.py:</p>

<pre><code>ffi.cdef(""""""

"39241144","2","39240325","<p>Interactive mode or <strong>Calculator mode</strong>, is an interactive mode that comes with python. If you have installed python, then you have also, installed something called the <strong>Python Shell</strong>. </p>

<p>There are two ways you can access the Python Shell:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Typing <code>python</code> or <code>python[version-number]</code> in your command 
prompt/terminal window:</p>

<p>Assuming that you have python in your <code>PATH</code> variable, you can access
the Python Shell by simply typing <code>python</code> or <code>python[version-number]</code>
in your command prompt/terminal window.</p></li>
<li><p>Running the Python Shell in the Python IDLE(Integrated Development Environment) GUI:</p>

<p>To run the Python Shell in the Python IDLE GUI, you can type(again i'm assuming that the path to your python installation folder, is in your PATH variable), just type <code>idle</code> into your command prompt\terminal window and this should start the Python Shell in the Python IDLE GUI.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course the exact text for the Python Shell heading will vary between OS's, but all of them look very similar. Here is an example of what the heading appears like on my mac:</p>

<pre><code>Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.0 (clang-500.0.68)] on darwin
Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>As you might can tell from the text above, a newline in the Python Shell is denoted by three caret symbols: <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. Each newline, a new three carets are printed. When using Python Shell, there are a few differences, then just typing a script up, but the main one is that it execute your code line by line.</p>

<p>In the Python Shell you can only type one line of code at a time. Here is an example to illustrate my point further:</p>

<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;&gt; xyz = 100
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1, 20):
    ...     xyz += i
    ...     print(xyz)
    ... 
    101
    103
    106
    110
    115
    121
    128
    136
    145
    155
    166
    178
    191
    205
    220
    236
    253
    271
    290
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>As you can tell from the above program, indention is noted by three dots: <code>...</code>, and the only time the Python Shell shows more then one line at a time, is when it is 'echoing' back what you typed in.</p>

<h2>Why is it called interactive?</h2>

<p>One of the main reason its called interactive is that to display variable values or run the module in general, you don't have to explicitly invoke the python interpreter. Take the example below:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = ""Awsome""
&gt;&gt;&gt; name
'Awsome'
&gt;&gt;&gt; def func():
...     print(name)
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; func()
Awsome
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>As displayed above, I was able to print the value of <code>name</code> and run the function <code>func()</code> without having to use a print command or explicitly calling the python interpreter.</p>

<p>The Python Shell is not really a practical way to write long/complex programs, as writing code <code>__init__</code>(see what i did there) would prove to be cumbersome and awkward. A better choice would be to use the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python IDLE</a>. It is a script editor for python that comes builtin into the python installation package.</p>

<p>It isn't hard to write some code to compute the difference in proportion and its 95% confidence interval.  Here's one way:</p>

<pre><code>def diffprop(obs):
    """"""
    `obs` must be a 2x2 numpy array.

    Returns:
    delta
        The difference in proportions
    ci
        The Wald 95% confidence interval for delta
    corrected_ci
        Yates continuity correction for the 95% confidence interval of delta.
    """"""
    n1, n2 = obs.sum(axis=1)
    prop1 = obs[0,0] / n1
    prop2 = obs[1,0] / n2
    delta = prop1 - prop2

    # Wald 95% confidence interval for delta
    se = np.sqrt(prop1*(1 - prop1)/n1 + prop2*(1 - prop2)/n2)
    ci = (delta - 1.96*se, delta + 1.96*se)

    # Yates continuity correction for confidence interval of delta
    correction = 0.5*(1/n1 + 1/n2)
    corrected_ci = (ci[0] - correction, ci[1] + correction)

    return delta, ci, corrected_ci
</code></pre>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>In [22]: obs
Out[22]: 
array([[ 25,  75],
       [100, 100]])

In [23]: diffprop(obs)

 (-0.36706733089748972, -0.13293266910251031))
</code></pre>

<p>The first value returned is the difference in proportions <code>delta</code>.  The next two pairs are the Wald 95% confidence interval for <code>delta</code>, and the Wald 95% confidence interval with Yates continuity correction.</p>

<p>If you don't like those negative values, you can reverse the rows first:</p>

<pre><code>In [24]: diffprop(obs[::-1])
Out[24]: 
(0.25,
 (0.14043266910251032, 0.35956733089748971),
 (0.13293266910251031, 0.36706733089748972))
</code></pre>

<p>For comparison, here is a similar calculation in R:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; obs
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]   25   75
[2,]  100  100
&gt; prop.test(obs, correct=FALSE)

    correction

&gt; prop.test(obs, correct=TRUE)

"39239832","2","39239696","<p>As general rule, iterative operations on numpy arrays is slower than equivalent ones on lists.  In part that's because creating an array from a list takes time, whether it's the initial creation or some intermediate step.  Numpy arrays gain their speed advantage when you perform compiled operations on them - ones where the iteration takes place at compiled speeds rather than interpreted ones.</p>

<p>In your example, the dictionary source isn't important</p>

<pre><code>In [372]: arr = d['items'][0]['coords']

<p>Take the simple task of adding 1 to all values:</p>

<pre><code>In [379]: timeit narr+1   # compiled operation

<p>Your string formatting case:</p>

<pre><code>In [383]: a=[' '.join(map(str, c)) for c in arr]
In [384]: a

<p><code>[c for c on narr]</code> produces a list of 4 arrays; <code>[str(i) for i in c]</code> then requires iterating on each of those subarrays.</p>

<p>Making a list of <code>Point</code> objects from a numpy array is a poor use of the structure.</p>

<p>You could make a <code>structured</code> array, and access 'x' values for a whole set of points.  That's the key - use arrays when you want to work with the whole structure, or at least whole rows and columns.</p>

Unfortunately there is an inconsistency in tkinter in that attaching a <code>Button</code> to a parent widget increments the reference count, but adding an image to a widget does not increment the reference count.
