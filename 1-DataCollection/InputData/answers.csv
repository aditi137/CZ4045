If you want someone to agree with you that you should use python, then show them how python's features apply specifically to that problem.</p>

<p>In the case of web development with python, talk about WSGI and other web libraries and frameworks you could use that would make your life easier.  One note for python is that most of the frameworks for python web development can be plugged right into any current project. With ruby on rails, you're practically working in a DSL that anyone who uses your project will have to learn.  If they know python, then they can figure out what you are doing with django, etc in a day.</p>

<p>I'm only talking about web development because it appears that's what you are going to be working on seeing ruby, python and PHP in the same list.  The real message that's important is applying to whatever it is you like about python <em>directly</em> to some problem you are trying to solve.</p>

<p>OOPS concepts are followed by most languages now , so how come Python can stay behind! Inheritance, Abstraction and Encapsulation are followed by Python as well.</p>

<p>Python as of now is divided into two versions popularly that are not much different in terms of performance but features. <strong>Python2.x and Python 3.x</strong> both have same syntax ,except for some statements like :-</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>print ""...""</strong> in Python2.x and <strong>print()</strong> in Python3.x</li>
<li><strong>raw_input()</strong> in Python2.x and <strong>input()</strong> in Python3.x (<em>for getting user input</em>)</li>

While I'm not a fan of this statement in real life, it does apply in a lot of cases.  Usually you want to avoid code that chains two system calls on the same file, because you never know what will happen to the file in between your two calls in your code.</p>

<p><strong>A typical mistake is to write something like</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>if os.path.exists(path):
    os.unlink(path)
</code></pre>

<p>The second call (os.unlink) may fail if something else deleted it after your if test, raise an Exception, and stop the rest of your function from executing.  (You might think this doesn't happen in real life, but we just fished another bug like that out of our codebase last week - and it was the kind of bug that left a few programmers scratching their head and claiming 'Heisenbug' for the last few months)</p>

<p>So, in your particular case, I would probably do:</p>

<pre><code>try:
    os.stat(path)
except OSError, e:
    if e.errno == errno.ENOENT:
        print 'path %s does not exist or is a broken symlink' % path
    else:
        raise e
</code></pre>

<p>The annoyance here is that stat returns the same error code for a symlink that just isn't there and a broken symlink.</p>

<p>So, I guess you have no choice than to break the atomicity, and do something like</p>

<pre><code>if not os.path.exists(os.readlink(path)):
    print 'path %s is a broken symlink' % path

<ol>

<p>This is another nice and easy way of implementing enums although it doesn't really save enums in the database.</p>

<p>However it does allow you to reference the 'label' whenever querying or specifying defaults as opposed to the top-rated answer where you have to use the 'value' (which may be a number).</p>

The biggest thing you need to know about is the Global Interpreter Lock.  This allows only one thread to access the interpreter.  This means two things:  1)  you rarely ever find yourself using a lock statement in python and 2) if you want to take advantage of multi-processor systems, you have to use separate processes.  EDIT:  I should also point out that you can put some of the code in C/C++ if you want to get around the GIL as well.</p>

<p>Thus, you need to re-consider why you want to use threads.  If you want to parallelize your app to take advantage of dual-core architecture, you need to consider breaking your app up into multiple processes.</p>

<p>If you want to improve responsiveness, you should CONSIDER using threads.  There are other alternatives though, namely <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microthread"" rel=""noreferrer"">microthreading</a>.  There are also some frameworks that you should look into:</p>

<p>From the last link an interesting quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let me explain what all that means. 
  Threads run inside the same virtual
  machine, and hence run on the same
  physical machine.  Processes can run
  on the same physical machine or in
  another physical machine.  If you
  architect your application around
  threads, you’ve done nothing to access
  multiple machines.  So, you can scale
  to as many cores are on the single
  machine (which will be quite a few
  over time), but to really reach web
  scales, you’ll need to solve the
  multiple machine problem anyway.</p>

<p>In anycase I would guess that <code>import</code>ing causes the new code to run in the same execution context as the GPLed bit, and you should treat it like the dynamic link case. No?</p>

  <p>he distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, besides being kind of artificial,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't think its artificial at all.  Basically they are just making the division based upon the level of integration.  If the program has ""plugins"" which are essentially fire and forget with no API level integration, then the resulting work is unlikely to be considered a derived work.  Generally speaking a plugin which is merely forked/exec'ed would fit this criteria, though there may be cases where it does not.  This case especially applies if the ""plugin"" code would work independently of your code as well.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the code is deeply dependent upon the GPL'ed work, such as extensively calling APIs, or tight data structure integration, then things are more likely to be considered a derived work.  Ie, the ""plugin"" cannot exist on its own without the GPL product, and a product with this plugin installed is essentially a derived work of the GPLed product.</p>

<p>So to make it a little more clear, the same principles could apply to your interpreted code.  If the interpreted code relies heavily upon your APIs (or vice-versa) then it would be considered a derived work.  If it is just a script that executes on its own with extremely little integration, then it may not.</p>

<p>Does that make more sense?</p>

Basically, the Oracle ODBC driver does not support the <code>TIMESTAMP WITH (LOCAL) TIME ZONE</code> data types, only the <code>TIMESTAMP</code> data type. As you have discovered, one workaround is in fact to use the <code>TO_CHAR</code> method.</p>

<p>In your example you are not actually reading the time zone information. If you have control of the table you could convert it to a straight <code>TIMESTAMP</code> column. If you don't have control over the table, another solution may be to create a view that converts from <code>TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE</code> to <code>TIMESTAMP</code> via a string - sorry, I don't know if there is a way to convert directly from <code>TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE</code> to <code>TIMESTAMP</code>.</p>

"38916","2","","38601","2008-09-02 06:10:58","","145","","<p>The growing complexity of this answer over time, and the many hacks required, probably ought to caution you against doing this at all. It's relying on undocumented internal implementation details of the admin, is likely to break again in future versions of Django, and is no easier to implement than just finding another JS calendar widget and using that.</p>

<p>That said, here's what you have to do if you're determined to make this work:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Define your own ModelForm subclass for your model (best to put it in forms.py in your app), and tell it to use the AdminDateWidget / AdminTimeWidget / AdminSplitDateTime (replace 'mydate' etc with the proper field names from your model):</p>

<pre><code>from django import forms
from my_app.models import Product
from django.contrib.admin import widgets                                       

class ProductForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Product
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(ProductForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['mydate'].widget = widgets.AdminDateWidget()
        self.fields['mytime'].widget = widgets.AdminTimeWidget()
        self.fields['mydatetime'].widget = widgets.AdminSplitDateTime()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change your URLconf to pass 'form_class': ProductForm instead of 'model': Product to the generic create_object view (that'll mean ""from my_app.forms import ProductForm"" instead of ""from my_app.models import Product"", of course).</p></li>
<li><p>In the head of your template, include {{ form.media }} to output the links to the Javascript files.</p></li>
<li><p>And the hacky part: the admin date/time widgets presume that the i18n JS stuff has been loaded, and also require core.js, but don't provide either one automatically.  So in your template above {{ form.media }} you'll need:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/my_admin/jsi18n/""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""/media/admin/js/core.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You may also wish to use the following admin CSS (thanks <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38601/using-django-time-date-widgets-in-custom-form/719583#719583"">Alex</a> for mentioning this):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/media/admin/css/forms.css""/&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/media/admin/css/base.css""/&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/media/admin/css/global.css""/&gt;
&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""/media/admin/css/widgets.css""/&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>This implies that Django's admin media (ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX) is at /media/admin/ - you can change that for your setup.  Ideally you'd use a context processor to pass this values to your template instead of hardcoding it, but that's beyond the scope of this question.</p>

<p>This also requires that the URL /my_admin/jsi18n/ be manually wired up to the django.views.i18n.javascript_catalog view (or null_javascript_catalog if you aren't using I18N).  You have to do this yourself instead of going through the admin application so it's accessible regardless of whether you're logged into the admin (thanks <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38601/using-django-time-date-widgets-in-custom-form/408230#408230"">Jeremy</a> for pointing this out).  Sample code for your URLconf:</p>

<pre><code>(r'^my_admin/jsi18n', 'django.views.i18n.javascript_catalog'),
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, if you are using Django 1.2 or later, you need some additional code in your template to help the widgets find their media:</p>

<pre><code>{% load adminmedia %} /* At the top of the template. */

/* In the head section of the template. */
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
window.__admin_media_prefix__ = ""{% filter escapejs %}{% admin_media_prefix %}{% endfilter %}"";
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

If you want a copy that's a merge, then use copy (or <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">deepcopy</a>, depending on what you want) and then update.  The two lines of code are much more readable - more Pythonic - than the single line creation with .items() + .items().  Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

<p>In addition, when you use .items() (pre Python 3.0), you're creating a new list that contains the items from the dict.  If your dictionaries are large, then that is quite a lot of overhead (two large lists that will be thrown away as soon as the merged dict is created).  update() can work more efficiently, because it can run through the second dict item-by-item.</p>

<p>In terms of <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">time</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit.Timer(""dict(x, **y)"", ""x = dict(zip(range(1000), range(1000)))\ny=dict(zip(range(1000,2000), range(1000,2000)))"").timeit(100000)

41.484580039978027
</code></pre>

<p>IMO the tiny slowdown between the first two is worth it for the readability.  In addition, keyword arguments for dictionary creation was only added in Python 2.3, whereas copy() and update() will work in older versions.</p>

"228366","2","","38987","2008-10-23 02:38:56","","97","","<p>In a follow-up answer, you asked about the relative performance of these two alternatives:</p>

<pre><code>z1 = dict(x.items() + y.items())
z2 = dict(x, **y)
</code></pre>

<p>On my machine, at least (a fairly ordinary x86_64 running Python 2.5.2), alternative <code>z2</code> is not only shorter and simpler but also significantly faster.  You can verify this for yourself using the <code>timeit</code> module that comes with Python.</p>

<p>Example 1: identical dictionaries mapping 20 consecutive integers to themselves:</p>

<pre><code>% python -m timeit -s 'x=y=dict((i,i) for i in range(20))' 'z1=dict(x.items() + y.items())'
100000 loops, best of 3: 5.67 usec per loop
% python -m timeit -s 'x=y=dict((i,i) for i in range(20))' 'z2=dict(x, **y)' 
100000 loops, best of 3: 1.53 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p><code>z2</code> wins by a factor of 3.5 or so.  Different dictionaries seem to yield quite different results, but <code>z2</code> always seems to come out ahead.  (If you get inconsistent results for the <em>same</em> test, try passing in <code>-r</code> with a number larger than the default 3.)</p>

<p>Example 2: non-overlapping dictionaries mapping 252 short strings to integers and vice versa:</p>

<pre><code>% python -m timeit -s 'from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y' 'z1=dict(x.items() + y.items())'
1000 loops, best of 3: 260 usec per loop
% python -m timeit -s 'from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y' 'z2=dict(x, **y)'               
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.9 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p><code>z2</code> wins by about a factor of 10.  That's a pretty big win in my book!</p>

<p>After comparing those two, I wondered if <code>z1</code>'s poor performance could be attributed to the overhead of constructing the two item lists, which in turn led me to wonder if this variation might work better:</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain
z3 = dict(chain(x.iteritems(), y.iteritems()))
</code></pre>

<p>A few quick tests, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>% python -m timeit -s 'from itertools import chain; from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y' 'z3=dict(chain(x.iteritems(), y.iteritems()))'
10000 loops, best of 3: 66 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>lead me to conclude that <code>z3</code> is somewhat faster than <code>z1</code>, but not nearly as fast as <code>z2</code>.  Definitely not worth all the extra typing.</p>

<p>This discussion is still missing something important, which is a performance comparison of these alternatives with the ""obvious"" way of merging two lists: using the <code>update</code> method.  To try to keep things on an equal footing with the expressions, none of which modify x or y, I'm going to make a copy of x instead of modifying it in-place, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>z0 = dict(x)
z0.update(y)
</code></pre>

<p>A typical result:</p>

<pre><code>% python -m timeit -s 'from htmlentitydefs import codepoint2name as x, name2codepoint as y' 'z0=dict(x); z0.update(y)'
10000 loops, best of 3: 26.9 usec per loop
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, <code>z0</code> and <code>z2</code> seem to have essentially identical performance.  Do you think this might be a coincidence?  I don't....</p>

<p>In fact, I'd go so far as to claim that it's impossible for pure Python code to do any better than this.  And if you can do significantly better in a C extension module, I imagine the Python folks might well be interested in incorporating your code (or a variation on your approach) into the Python core.  Python uses <code>dict</code> in lots of places; optimizing its operations is a big deal.</p>

<p>You could also write this as</p>

<pre><code>z0 = x.copy()
z0.update(y)
</code></pre>

<p>as Tony does, but (not surprisingly) the difference in notation turns out not to have any measurable effect on performance.  Use whichever looks right to you.  Of course, he's absolutely correct to point out that the two-statement version is much easier to understand.</p>

<p>Personally I like this version best because it describes fairly good what I want in a single  functional syntax. The only minor problem is that it doesn't make completely obvious that values from y takes precedence over values from x, but I don't believe it's difficult to figure that out.</p>

<p>A couple more points for python 3. First, note that the <code>dict(x, **y)</code> trick won't work in python 3 unless the keys in <code>y</code> are strings.</p>

<p>Also, Raymond Hettinger's Chainmap <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/16259217/386279"">answer</a> is pretty elegant, since it can take an arbitrary number of dicts as arguments, but <a href=""http://docs.python.org/dev/library/collections"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from the docs</a> it looks like it sequentially looks through a list of all the dicts for each lookup:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lookups search the underlying mappings successively until a key is found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This can slow you down if you have a lot of lookups in your application:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: from collections import ChainMap
In [2]: from string import ascii_uppercase as up, ascii_lowercase as lo; x = dict(zip(lo, up)); y = dict(zip(up, lo))
In [3]: chainmap_dict = ChainMap(y, x)

<p>So about an order of magnitude slower for lookups. I'm a fan of Chainmap, but looks less practical where there may be many lookups.</p>

  <h1>How can I merge two Python dictionaries in a single expression?</h1>
</blockquote>

<p>Say you have two dicts and you want to merge them into a new dict without altering the original dicts:</p>

<pre><code>x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
y = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
</code></pre>

<p>The desired result is to get a new dictionary (<code>z</code>) with the values merged, and the second dict's values overwriting those from the first.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; z
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
</code></pre>

<p>A new syntax for this, proposed in <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448"" rel=""noreferrer"">PEP 448</a> and <a href=""https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2015-February/138564.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">available as of Python 3.5</a>, is </p>

<pre><code>z = {**x, **y}
</code></pre>

<p>And it is indeed a single expression. It is now showing as implemented in the <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478/#features-for-3-5"" rel=""noreferrer"">release schedule for 3.5, PEP 478</a>, and it has now made its way into <a href=""https://docs.python.org/dev/whatsnew/3.5.html#pep-448-additional-unpacking-generalizations"" rel=""noreferrer"">What's New in Python 3.5</a> document.</p>

<p>However, since many organizations are still on Python 2, you may wish to do this in a backwards compatible way. The classically Pythonic way, available in Python 2 and Python 3.0-3.4, is to do this as a two-step process:</p>

<pre><code>z = x.copy()
z.update(y) # which returns None since it mutates z
</code></pre>

<p>In both approaches, <code>y</code> will come second and its values will replace <code>x</code>'s values, thus <code>'b'</code> will point to <code>3</code> in our final result.</p>

<h1>Not yet on Python 3.5, but want a <em>single expression</em></h1>

<p>If you are not yet on Python 3.5, or need to write backward-compatible code, and you want this in a <em>single expression</em>, the most performant while correct approach is to put it in a function:</p>

<pre><code>def merge_two_dicts(x, y):
    """"""Given two dicts, merge them into a new dict as a shallow copy.""""""
    z = x.copy()
    z.update(y)
    return z
</code></pre>

<p>and then you have a single expression:</p>

<pre><code>z = merge_two_dicts(x, y)
</code></pre>

<p>You can also make a function to merge an undefined number of dicts, from zero to a very large number:</p>

<pre><code>def merge_dicts(*dict_args):
    """"""
    Given any number of dicts, shallow copy and merge into a new dict,
    precedence goes to key value pairs in latter dicts.
    """"""
    result = {}
    for dictionary in dict_args:
        result.update(dictionary)
    return result
</code></pre>

<p>This function will work in Python 2 and 3 for all dicts. e.g. given dicts <code>a</code> to <code>g</code>:</p>

<pre><code>z = merge_dicts(a, b, c, d, e, f, g) 
</code></pre>

<p>and key value pairs in <code>g</code> will take precedence over dicts <code>a</code> to <code>f</code>, and so on.</p>

<h1>Critiques of Other Answers</h1>

<p>Don't use what you see in the formerly accepted answer:</p>

<pre><code>z = dict(x.items() + y.items())
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 2, you create two lists in memory for each dict, create a third list in memory with length equal to the length of the first two put together, and then discard all three lists to create the dict. <strong>In Python 3, this will fail</strong> because you're adding two <code>dict_items</code> objects together, not two lists - </p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = dict(a.items() + b.items())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'dict_items' and 'dict_items'
</code></pre>

<p>and you would have to explicitly create them as lists, e.g. <code>z = dict(list(x.items()) + list(y.items()))</code>. This is a waste of resources and computation power. </p>

<p>Similarly, taking the union of <code>items()</code> in Python 3 (<code>viewitems()</code> in Python 2.7) will also fail when values are unhashable objects (like lists, for example). Even if your values are hashable, <strong>since sets are semantically unordered, the behavior is undefined in regards to precedence. So don't do this:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = dict(a.items() | b.items())
</code></pre>

<p>This example demonstrates what happens when values are unhashable:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = {'a': []}
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = {'b': []}
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(x.items() | y.items())
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an example where y should have precedence, but instead the value from x is retained due to the arbitrary order of sets:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = {'a': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = {'a': 1}
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(x.items() | y.items())
{'a': 2}
</code></pre>

<p>Another hack you should not use:</p>

<pre><code>z = dict(x, **y)
</code></pre>

<p>This uses the <code>dict</code> constructor, and is very fast and memory efficient (even slightly more-so than our two-step process) but unless you know precisely what is happening here (that is, the second dict is being passed as keyword arguments to the dict constructor), it's difficult to read, it's not the intended usage, and so it is not Pythonic. </p>

<p>Here's an example of the usage being <a href=""https://code.djangoproject.com/attachment/ticket/13357/django-pypy.2.diff"" rel=""noreferrer"">remediated in django</a>.</p>

<p>Dicts are intended to take hashable keys (e.g. frozensets or tuples), but <strong>this method fails in Python 3 when keys are not strings.</strong></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = dict(a, **b)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: keyword arguments must be strings
</code></pre>

<p>From the <a href=""https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2010-April/099459.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">mailing list</a>, Guido van Rossum, the creator of the language, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am fine with
  declaring dict({}, **{1:3}) illegal, since after all it is abuse of
  the ** mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apparently dict(x, **y) is going around as ""cool hack"" for ""call
  x.update(y) and return x"". Personally I find it more despicable than
  cool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is my understanding (as well as the understanding of the <a href=""https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2010-April/099485.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">creator of the language</a>) that the intended usage for <code>dict(**y)</code> is for creating dicts for readability purposes, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>dict(a=1, b=10, c=11)
</code></pre>

<p>instead of </p>

<pre><code>{'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 11}
</code></pre>

<h2>Response to comments</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite what Guido says, <code>dict(x, **y)</code> is in line with the dict specification, which btw. works for both Python 2 and 3. The fact that this only works for string keys is a direct consequence of how keyword parameters work and not a short-comming of dict. Nor is using the ** operator in this place an abuse of the mechanism, in fact ** was designed precisely to pass dicts as keywords. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, it doesn't work for 3 when keys are non-strings. The implicit calling contract is that namespaces take ordinary dicts, while users must only pass keyword arguments that are strings. All other callables enforced it. <code>dict</code> broke this consistency in Python 2:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo(**{('a', 'b'): None})
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: foo() keywords must be strings
&gt;&gt;&gt; dict(**{('a', 'b'): None})
{('a', 'b'): None}
</code></pre>

<p>This inconsistency was bad given other implementations of Python (Pypy, Jython, IronPython). Thus it was fixed in Python 3, as this usage could be a breaking change.</p>

<p>I submit to you that it is malicious incompetence to intentionally write code that only works in one version of a language or that only works given certain arbitrary constraints.</p>

<p>Another comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>dict(x.items() + y.items())</code> is still the most readable solution for Python 2. Readability counts. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My response: <code>merge_two_dicts(x, y)</code> actually seems much clearer to me, if we're actually concerned about readability. And it is not forward compatible, as Python 2 is increasingly deprecated.</p>

<h1>Less Performant But Correct Ad-hocs</h1>

<p>These approaches are less performant, but they will provide correct behavior.
They will be <em>much less</em> performant than <code>copy</code> and <code>update</code> or the new unpacking because they iterate through each key-value pair at a higher level of abstraction, but they <em>do</em> respect the order of precedence (latter dicts have precedence)</p>

<p>You can also chain the dicts manually inside a dict comprehension:</p>

<pre><code>{k: v for d in dicts for k, v in d.items()} # iteritems in Python 2.7
</code></pre>

<p>or in python 2.6 (and perhaps as early as 2.4 when generator expressions were introduced):</p>

<pre><code>dict((k, v) for d in dicts for k, v in d.items())
</code></pre>

<p><code>itertools.chain</code> will chain the iterators over the key-value pairs in the correct order:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
z = dict(itertools.chain(x.iteritems(), y.iteritems()))
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on the use case it might not be necessary to create a ""real"" merged dictionary of the given input dictionaries.  A <em>view</em> which does this might be sufficient in many cases, i. e. an object which acts <em>like</em> the merged dictionary would without computing it completely.  A lazy version of the merged dictionary, so to speak.</p>

<p>In Python, this is rather simple and can be done with the code shown at the end of my post.  This given, the answer to the original question would be:</p>

<pre><code>z = MergeDict(x, y)
</code></pre>

<p>When using this new object, it will behave like a merged dictionary but it will have constant creation time and constant memory footprint while leaving the original dictionaries untouched.  Creating it is way cheaper than in the other solutions proposed.</p>

<p>Of course, if you use the result a lot, then you will at some point reach the limit where creating a real merged dictionary would have been the faster solution.  As I said, it depends on your use case.</p>

<p>If you ever felt you would prefer to have a real merged <code>dict</code>, then calling <code>dict(z)</code> would produce it (but way more costly than the other solutions of course, so this is just worth mentioning).</p>

<p>You can also use this class to make a kind of copy-on-write dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>a = { 'x': 3, 'y': 4 }
b = MergeDict(a)  # we merge just one dict
b['x'] = 5
print b  # will print {'x': 5, 'y': 4}
print a  # will print {'y': 4, 'x': 3}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the straight-forward code of <code>MergeDict</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class MergeDict(object):
  def __init__(self, *originals):
    self.originals = ({},) + originals[::-1]  # reversed

  def __getitem__(self, key):
    for original in self.originals:
      try:
        return original[key]
      except KeyError:
        pass
    raise KeyError(key)

  def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    self.originals[0][key] = value

  def __iter__(self):
    return iter(self.keys())

  def __repr__(self):
    return '%s(%s)' % (
      self.__class__.__name__,
      ', '.join(repr(original)
          for original in reversed(self.originals)))

  def __str__(self):
    return '{%s}' % ', '.join(
        '%r: %r' % i for i in self.iteritems())

  def iteritems(self):
    found = set()
    for original in self.originals:
      for k, v in original.iteritems():
        if k not in found:
          yield k, v
          found.add(k)

  def items(self):

<pre><code>import fileinput

    print ""%d: %s"" % (fileinput.filelineno(), line),

<p>What happens here is:</p>

<ol>
<li>The original file is moved to a backup file</li>
<li>The standard output is redirected to the original file within the loop</li>
<li>Thus any <code>print</code> statements write back into the original file</li>
</ol>

<p><code>fileinput</code> has more bells and whistles. For example, it can be used to automatically operate on all files in <code>sys.args[1:]</code>, without your having to iterate over them explicitly. Starting with Python 3.2 it also provides a convenient context manager for use in a <code>with</code> statement.</p>

<hr>

<p>While <code>fileinput</code> is great for throwaway scripts, I would be wary of using it in real code because admittedly it's not very readable or familiar. In real (production) code it's worthwhile to spend just a few more lines of code to make the process explicit and thus make the code readable.</p>

<p>There are two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>The file is not overly large, and you can just read it wholly to memory. Then close the file, reopen it in writing mode and write the modified contents back.</li>
<li>The file is too large to be stored in memory; you can move it over to a temporary file and open that, reading it line by line, writing back into the original file. Note that this requires twice the storage.</li>

<p>GvR describes a general/standard project layout on page 10 of his <a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/io/rapid-development-with-python-django-and-google-app-engine/rapid_development_with_django_gae.pdf?attredirects=0"" rel=""noreferrer"">slide presentation</a>.  </p>

<p>Here I'll post a slightly modified version of the layout/structure from that page. I pretty much follow this pattern myself. You also mentioned you had trouble with packages. Just make sure each of your sub folders has an __init__.py file. It's ok if its empty.</p>

<h2>Boilerplate files</h2>

<ul>
<li>These hardly vary between projects</li>
<li>app.yaml: direct all non-static requests to main.py </li>
<li>main.py: initialize app and send it all requests </li>
</ul>

<h2>Project lay-out</h2>

<ul>
<li>static/*: static files; served directly by App Engine</li>
<li>myapp/*.py: app-specific python code

<ul>
<li>views.py, models.py, tests.py, __init__.py, and more</li>
</ul></li>
<li>templates/*.html: templates (or myapp/templates/*.html)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some code examples that may help as well:</p>

<h2>main.py</h2>

<pre><code>import wsgiref.handlers

from google.appengine.ext import webapp
from myapp.views import *

application = webapp.WSGIApplication([
  ('/', IndexHandler),
  ('/foo', FooHandler)
], debug=True)

def main():
  wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler().run(application)
</code></pre>

<h2>myapp/views.py</h2>

<pre><code>import os
import datetime
import logging
import time

from google.appengine.api import urlfetch
from google.appengine.ext.webapp import template
from google.appengine.api import users
from google.appengine.ext import webapp
from models import *

class IndexHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
  def get(self):
    date = ""foo""
    # Do some processing        
    template_values = {'data': data }
    path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__) + '/../templates/', 'main.html')
    self.response.out.write(template.render(path, template_values))

class FooHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):
  def get(self):
    #logging.debug(""start of handler"")
</code></pre>

<h2>myapp/models.py</h2>

<pre><code>from google.appengine.ext import db

class SampleModel(db.Model):
</code></pre>

<p>I think this layout works great for new and relatively small to medium projects. For larger projects I would suggest breaking up the views and models to have their own sub-folders with something like:</p>

<h2>Project lay-out</h2>

<ul>
<li>static/: static files; served directly by App Engine

<ul>
<li>js/*.js</li>
<li>images/*.gif|png|jpg</li>
<li>css/*.css</li>
</ul></li>
<li>myapp/: app structure

<ul>
<li>models/*.py</li>
<li>views/*.py</li>
<li>tests/*.py</li>
<li>templates/*.html: templates</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li><code>__init__.py</code> - common functionality, including a request handler base class</li>

<li>controllers - contains all the handlers. request.yaml imports these.</li>

<li>all the django templates, used by the controllers</li>

<li>model

  <p>There are many deployment options for
  Python code. I'll share what has
  worked well for me on Windows,
  packaging command line tools and
  services using py2exe and InnoSetup.
  I'll demonstrate a simple build script
  which creates windows binaries and an
  InnoSetup installer in one step. In
  addition, I'll go over common errors
  which come up when using py2exe and
  hints on troubleshooting them. This is

Run the same as a compiled program just larger because the program is being compiled along with the PVM. Py2exe can freeze standalone programs that use the tkinter, PMW, wxPython, and PyGTK GUI libraties; programs that use the pygame game programming toolkit; win32com client programs; and more. 
The Stackless Python system is a standard CPython implementation variant that does not save state on the C language call stack. This makes Python more easy to port to small stack architectures, provides efficient multiprocessing options, and fosters novel programming structures such as coroutines. Other systems of study that are working on future development: Pyrex is working on the Cython system, the Parrot project, the PyPy is working on replacing the PVM altogether, and of course the founder of Python is working with Google to get Python to run 5 times faster than C with the Unladen Swallow project. In short, py2exe is the easiest and Cython is more efficient for now until these projects improve the Python Virtual Machine (PVM) for standalone files.</p>

I think that hardest part for C learner is pointers and everything else related to memory management. Also C lang is oriented on structured programming, so you will need to learn how to implement data structures and algorithms without OOP goodness. Actually, your question is pretty hard, usually people go from low level langs to high level and I can understand frustration of those who goes in other direction.</p>

The benefit is you can learn the lower level syntax without having to learn pointers (since memory is managed for you just like in Python and PHP).  You will, however, learn a similar concept... references (or objects in general).</p>

"49285","2","","49195","2008-09-08 07:49:49","","5","","<p>I generally agree with most of the others - There's not really a good stepping stone language.</p>

<p>It is, however, useful to understand what is difficult about learning C, which might help you understand what's making it difficult for you.</p>

<p>I'd say the things that would prove difficult in C for someone coming from PHP would be :</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pointers and memory management</strong><br /> This is pretty much the reason you're learning C I imagine, so there's not really any getting around it. Learning lower level assembly type languages might make this easier, but C is probably a bridge to do that, not the other way around.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of built in data structures</strong><br /> PHP and co all have native String types, and useful things like hash tables built in, which is not the case in C. In C, a String is just an array of characters, which means you'll need to do a lot more work, or look seriously at libraries which add the features you're used to.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of built in libraries</strong><br /> Languages like PHP nowadays almost always come with stacks of libraries for things like database connections, image manipulation and stacks of other things. In C, this is not the case other than a very thin standard library which revolves mostly around file reading, writing and basic string manipulation. There are almost always good choices available to fill these needs, but you need to include them yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Suitability for high level tasks</strong><br /> If you try to implement the same type of application in C as you might in PHP, you'll find it very slow going. Generating a web page, for example, isn't really something plain C is suited for, so if you're trying to do that, you'll find it very slow going.</li>
<li><strong>Preprocessor and compilation</strong><br /> Most languages these days don't have a preprocessor, and if you're coming from PHP, the compilation cycle will seem painful. Both of these are performance trade offs in a way - Scripting languages make the trade off in terms of developer efficiency, where as C prefers performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure there are more that aren't springing to mind for me right now. The moral of the story is that trying to understand what you're finding difficult in C may help you proceed. If you're trying to generate web pages with it, try doing something lower level. If you're missing hash tables, try writing your own, or find a library. If you're struggling with pointers, stick with it :)</p>

<p>Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is don't worry too much about the syntax, focus on said language's library.  This isn't specific to C, you can say the same about c#, vb.net, java and just about every other language out there.</p>

<p>Does the Postgres query run faster a second time once it has had a chance to cache the data?  To be a little fairer your test for Java and Python should cover the cost of acquiring the data in the first place (ideally loading it off disk).</p>

<p>If this performance level is a problem for your application in practice but you need a RDBMS for other reasons then you could look at <a href=""http://www.danga.com/memcached/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">memcached</a>.

"51745","2","","51553","2008-09-09 12:31:26","","13","","<p>I would say your test scheme is not really useful. To fulfill the db query, the db server goes through several steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>parse the SQL</li>
<li>work up a query plan, i. e. decide on which indices to use (if any), optimize etc.</li>
<li>if an index is used, search it for the pointers to the actual data, then go to the appropriate location in the data or</li>
<li>if no index is used, scan <i>the whole table</i> to determine which rows are needed</li>
<li>load the data from disk into a temporary location (hopefully, but not necessarily, memory)</li>
<li>perform the count() and avg() calculations</li>
</ol>

<p>So, creating an array in Python and getting the average basically skips all these steps save the last one. As disk I/O is among the most expensive operations a program has to perform, this is a major flaw in the test (see also the answers to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26021/how-is-data-compression-more-effective-than-indexing-for-search-performance"">this question</a> I asked here before). Even if you read the data from disk in your other test, the process is completely different and it's hard to tell how relevant the results are.</p>

<p>To obtain more information about where Postgres spends its time, I would suggest the following tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compare the execution time of your query to a SELECT without the aggregating functions (i. e. cut step 5)</li>
<li>If you find that the aggregation leads to a significant slowdown, try if Python does it faster, obtaining the raw data through the plain SELECT from the comparison.</li>
</ul>

<p>To speed up your query, reduce disk access first. I doubt very much that it's the aggregation that takes the time.</p>

<p>There's several ways to do that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cache data (in memory!) for subsequent access, either via the db engine's own capabilities or with tools like memcached</li>
<li>Reduce the size of your stored data</li>
<li>Optimize the use of indices. Sometimes this can mean to skip index use altogether (after all, it's disk access, too). For MySQL, I seem to remember that it's recommended to skip indices if you assume that the query fetches more than 10% of all the data in the table.</li>
<li>If your query makes good use of indices, I know that for MySQL databases it helps to put indices and data on separate physical disks. However, I don't know whether that's applicable for Postgres.</li>
<li>There also might be more sophisticated problems such as swapping rows to disk if for some reason the result set can't be completely processed in memory. But I would leave that kind of research until I run into serious performance problems that I can't find another way to fix, as it requires knowledge about a lot of little under-the-hood details in your process.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Update:</b></p>

<p><i>I just realized that you seem to have no use for indices for the above query and most likely aren't using any, too, so my advice on indices probably wasn't helpful. Sorry. Still, I'd say that the aggregation is not the problem but disk access is. I'll leave the index stuff in, anyway, it might still have some use.</i></p>

<p>Is it possible to precompile the query and optimization plan? I would have thought the stored procedure would do this, but it doesn't really help.</p>

<p>To avoid disk access it's necessary to cache the whole table in memory, can I force Postgres to do that?  I think it's already doing this though, since the query executes in just 200 ms after repeated runs.</p>

<p>Can I tell Postgres that the table is read only, so it can optimize any locking code?</p>

<p>I think it's possible to estimate the query construction costs with an empty table (timings range from 20-60 ms) </p>

<p>I still can't see why the Java/Python tests are invalid.  Postgres just isn't doing that much more work (though I still haven't addressed the concurrency aspect, just the caching and query construction)</p>

<p>UPDATE: 
I don't think it's fair to compare the SELECTS as suggested by pulling 350,000 through the driver and serialization steps into Python to run the aggregation, nor even to omit the aggregation as the overhead in formatting and displaying is hard to separate from the timing.  If both engines are operating on in memory data, it should be an apples to apples comparison, I'm not sure how to guarantee that's already happening though.</p>

<p>Also consider the overhead of actually connecting to the server and the round trip required to send the request to the server and back.</p>

<p>I'd consider 200ms for something like this to be pretty good, A quick test on my oracle server, the same table structure with about 500k rows and no indexes, takes about 1 - 1.5 seconds, which is almost all just oracle sucking the data off disk.</p>

<p>The real question is, is 200ms fast enough?</p>

<p>-------------- More --------------------</p>

<p>I was interested in solving this using materialized views, since I've never really played with them. This is in oracle.</p>

<p>First I created a MV which refreshes every minute.</p>

<pre><code>create materialized view mv_so_x 
build immediate 
refresh complete 
START WITH SYSDATE NEXT SYSDATE + 1/24/60
 as select count(*),avg(a),avg(b),avg(c),avg(d) from so_x;
</code></pre>

<p>While its refreshing, there is no rows returned</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; select * from mv_so_x;

no rows selected

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
</code></pre>

<p>Once it refreshes, its MUCH faster than doing the raw query</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; select count(*),avg(a),avg(b),avg(c),avg(d) from so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:05.74
SQL&gt; select * from mv_so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>If we insert into the base table, the result is not immediately viewable view the MV.</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; insert into so_x values (1,2,3,4,5);

1 row created.

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; commit;

Commit complete.

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; select * from mv_so_x;

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899459 7495.38839 22.2905454 5.00276131 2.13432836

Elapsed: 00:00:00.00
SQL&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>But wait a minute or so, and the MV will update behind the scenes, and the result is returned fast as you could want.</p>

<pre><code>SQL&gt; /

  COUNT(*)     AVG(A)     AVG(B)     AVG(C)     AVG(D)
---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
   1899460 7495.35823 22.2905352 5.00276078 2.17647059

SQL&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't ideal. for a start, its not realtime, inserts/updates will not be immediately visible. Also, you've got a query running to update the MV whether you need it or not (this can be tune to whatever time frame, or on demand). But, this does show how much faster an MV can make it seem to the end user, if you can live with values which aren't quite upto the second accurate.</p>

<p>Materialized views are probably worth considering as I think I can precompute the most interesting forms of this query for most users.</p>

<p>I don't think query round trip time should be very high as i'm running the the queries on the same machine that runs Postgres, so it can't add much latency?</p>

<p>I've also done some checking into the cache sizes, and it seems Postgres relies on the OS to handle caching, they specifically mention BSD as the ideal OS for this, so I thinking Mac OS ought to be pretty smart about bringing the table into memory.  Unless someone has more specific params in mind I think more specific caching is out of my control.</p>

<p>In the end I can probably put up with 200 ms response times, but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied, as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks.</p>

<p>I just checked the timings using MySQL 5 and they are slightly worse than Postgres.  So barring some major caching breakthroughs, I guess this is what I can expect going the relational db route.</p>

<p>A quick back of the envelope calculation makes me suspect that you're paging from disk. Assuming Postgres uses 4-byte integers, you have (6 * 4) bytes per row, so your table is a minimum of (24 * 350,000) bytes ~ 8.4MB. Assuming 40 MB/s sustained throughput on your HDD, you're looking at right around 200ms to read the data (which, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51553/why-are-sql-aggregate-functions-so-much-slower-than-python-and-java-or-poor-man#51668"">as pointed out</a>, should be where almost all of the time is being spent). </p>

<p><em>I'm not sure how I'd test the query without using an aggregation function in a way that would be fair, since if i select all of the rows it'll spend tons of time serializing and formatting everything.

<p>You can use doxygen to document your Python code. You can either use the Python documentation string syntax:</p>

<pre><code>""""""@package docstring
Documentation for this module.

More details.
""""""

def func():
    """"""Documentation for a function.

    More details.
    """"""
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>In which case the comments will be extracted by doxygen, but you won't be able to use any of the <a href=""http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html#cmd_intro"" rel=""noreferrer"">special doxygen commands</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Or</strong> you can (similar to C-style languages under doxygen) double up the comment marker (<code>#</code>) on the first line before the member:</p>

<pre><code>## @package pyexample
#  Documentation for this module.
#
#  More details.

## Documentation for a function.
#
#  More details.
def func():
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>In that case, you can use the special doxygen commands. There's no particular Python output mode, but you can apparently improve the results by setting <code>OPTMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA</code> to <code>YES</code>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I'm a little surprised at the difference - it seems like once doxygen can detect the comments in ## blocks or """""" blocks, most of the work would be done and you'd be able to use the special commands in either case. Maybe they expect people using """""" to adhere to more Pythonic documentation practices and that would interfere with the special doxygen commands?</p>

<p>You generate your content using Doxygen, or you generate your content using Sphinx*.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Doxygen</strong>: It is not the tool of choice for most Python projects. But if you have to deal with other related projects written in C or C++ it could make sense. For this you can improve the integration between Doxygen and Python using <a href=""https://github.com/Feneric/doxypypy"" rel=""noreferrer"">doxypypy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sphinx</strong>: The defacto tool for documenting a Python project. You have three options here: manual, semi-automatic (stub generation) and fully automatic (Doxygen like). </p>

<ol>
<li>For manual API documentation you have Sphinx <a href=""http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autodoc.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">autodoc</a>. This is great to write a user guide with embedded API generated elements.</li>
<li>For semi-automatic you have Sphinx <a href=""http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/autosummary.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">autosummary</a>. You can either setup your build system to call sphinx-autogen or setup your Sphinx with the <code>autosummary_generate</code> config. You will require to setup a page with the autosummaries, and then manually edit the pages. You have options, but my experience with this approach is that it requires way too much configuration, and at the end even after creating new templates, I found bugs and the impossibility to determine exactly what was exposed as public API and what not. My opinion is this tool is good for stub generation that will require manual editing, and nothing more. Is like a shortcut to end up in manual.</li>
<li>Fully automatic. This have been criticized many times and for long we didn't have a good fully automatic Python API generator integrated with Sphinx until <a href=""http://autoapi.readthedocs.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">AutoAPI</a> came, which is a new kid in the block. This is by far the best for automatic API generation in Python (note: shameless self-promotion).</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>There are other options to note:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://breathe.readthedocs.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Breathe</a>: this started as a very good idea, and makes sense when you work with several related project in other languages that use Doxygen. The idea is to use Doxygen XML output and feed it to Sphinx to generate your API. So, you can keep all the goodness of Doxygen and unify the documentation system in Sphinx. Awesome in theory. Now, in practice, the last time I checked the project wasn't ready for production.</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor"" rel=""noreferrer"">pydoctor</a>*: Very particular. Generates its own output. It has some basic integration with Sphinx, and some nice features.</li>

<p>Using CGI is straightforward. Make sure your Apache config file has a cgi-bin set up. If not, follow their documentation (<a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/howto/cgi.html</a>). At that point all you need to do is place your Python scripts in the cgi-bin directory and the standard output will become the HTTP response. Refer to Python's documentation for further info (<a href=""https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/library/cgi.html</a>).</p>

<p>If you want to use a web framework you'll need to setup mod_python or FastCGI. These steps are dependent on which framework you want to use.

<p>Instead, I wrote a module-level function called <code>index()</code>, and had it return as a string the HTML of the page. It's also possible to have other module-level functions (e.g., <code>otherFunction()</code>) that can be accessed as further segments in the URI (e.g., <code>testScript/otherFunction</code> for the file <code>testScript.py</code>.)</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58711/how-would-you-design-a-very-pythonic-ui-framework#58917"">Like Justin said</a>, to implement this you would need to use a custom metaclass on class <code>App</code>, and a bunch of properties on <code>Para</code> and <code>Button</code>. This actually wouldn't be too hard.</p>

<p>The problem you run into next is: how do you keep track of the <em>order</em> that things appear in the class definition? In Python 2.x, there is no way to know if <code>t</code> should be above <code>b</code> or the other way around, since you receive the contents of the class definition as a python <code>dict</code>.</p>

<p>However, in Python 3.0 <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3115/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">metaclasses are being changed</a> in a couple of (minor) ways. One of them is the <code>__prepare__</code> method, which allows you to supply your own custom dictionary-like object to be used instead -- this means you'll be able to track the order in which items are defined, and position them accordingly in the window.</p>

<pre><code>class MyWindow(Window):
    class VBox:
        entry = Entry()
        bigtext = TextView()

        def on_entry_accepted(text):
            bigtext.value = eval(text).__doc__
</code></pre>

<p>The idea would be to interpret some containers (like windows) as simple classes, some containers (like tables, v/hboxes) recognized by object names, and simple widgets as objects.</p>

<p>I dont think one would have to name all containers inside a window, so some shortcuts (like old-style classes being recognized as widgets by names) would be desirable.</p>

<p>About the order of elements: in MyWindow above you don't have to track this (window is conceptually a one-slot container). In other containers you can try to keep track of the order assuming that each widget constructor have access to some global widget list. This is how it is done in django (AFAIK).</p>

<p>Few hacks here, few tweaks there... There are still few things to think of, but I believe it is possible... and usable, as long as you don't build complicated UIs.</p>

<p>However I am pretty happy with PyGTK+Glade. UI is just kind of data for me and it should be treated as data. There's just too much parameters to tweak (like spacing in different places) and it is better to manage that using a GUI tool. Therefore I build my UI in glade, save as xml and parse using gtk.glade.XML().</p>

"336089","2","","58711","2008-12-03 02:37:06","","1","","<p>Here's an approach that goes about GUI definitions a bit differently using class-based meta-programming rather than inheritance.</p>

<p>This is largley Django/SQLAlchemy inspired in that it is heavily based on meta-programming and separates your GUI code from your ""code code"".  I also think it should make heavy use of layout managers like Java does because when you're dropping code, no one wants to constantly tweak pixel alignment.  I also think it would be cool if we could have CSS-like properties.</p>

<p>Here is a rough brainstormed example that will show a column with a label on top, then a text box, then a button to click on the bottom which shows a message.</p>

<pre>
from happygui.controls import *

MAIN_WINDOW = Window(width=""500px"", height=""350px"",
    my_layout=ColumnLayout(padding=""10px"",
        my_label=Label(text=""What's your name kiddo?"", bold=True, align=""center""),
        my_edit=EditBox(placeholder=""""),
        my_btn=Button(text=""CLICK ME!"", on_click=Handler('module.file.btn_clicked')),
    ),
)
MAIN_WINDOW.show()

def btn_clicked(sender): # could easily be in a handlers.py file
    name = MAIN_WINDOW.my_layout.my_edit.text
    # same thing: name = sender.parent.my_edit.text
    # best practice, immune to structure change: MAIN_WINDOW.find('my_edit').text
    MessageBox(""Your name is '%s'"" % ()).show(modal=True)
</pre>

<p>One cool thing to notice is the way you can reference the input of my_edit by saying <code>MAIN_WINDOW.my_layout.my_edit.text</code>.  In the declaration for the window, I think it's important to be able to arbitrarily name controls in the function kwargs.</p>

<p>Here is the same app only using absolute positioning (the controls will appear in different places because we're not using a fancy layout manager):</p>

<pre>
from happygui.controls import *

MAIN_WINDOW = Window(width=""500px"", height=""350px"",
    my_label=Label(text=""What's your name kiddo?"", bold=True, align=""center"", x=""10px"", y=""10px"", width=""300px"", height=""100px""),
    my_edit=EditBox(placeholder="""", x=""10px"", y=""110px"", width=""300px"", height=""100px""),
    my_btn=Button(text=""CLICK ME!"", on_click=Handler('module.file.btn_clicked'), x=""10px"", y=""210px"", width=""300px"", height=""100px""),
)
MAIN_WINDOW.show()

def btn_clicked(sender): # could easily be in a handlers.py file
    name = MAIN_WINDOW.my_edit.text
    # same thing: name = sender.parent.my_edit.text
    # best practice, immune to structure change: MAIN_WINDOW.find('my_edit').text
    MessageBox(""Your name is '%s'"" % ()).show(modal=True)
</pre>

<p>I'm not entirely sure yet if this is a super great approach, but I definitely think it's on the right path.  I don't have time to explore this idea more, but if someone took this up as a project, I would love them.</p>

<p>Basically, you create the GUI layout in Glade. You also specify event callbacks in glade. Then you write a class for your window like this:</p>

<p>If I were to design a Pythonic GUI library, I would support something similar, to aid rapid development. The only difference is that I would ensure that the widgets have a more pythonic interface too. The current PyGTK classes seem very C to me, except that I use foo.bar(...) instead of bar(foo, ...) though I'm not sure exactly what I'd do differently. Probably allow for a Django models style declarative means of specifying widgets and events in code and allowing you to access data though iterators (where it makes sense, eg widget lists perhaps), though I haven't really thought about it.</p>

Maintain a symmetric directory structure. This would be helpful in packaging just the core libraries and not package the unit tests. Below is implemented through a schematic diagram. </p>

              __init__.py]

<p>When your code gets larger and you add more libraries it's better to create a test folder in the same directory you have setup.py and mirror your project directory structure for each test type (unittest, integration, ...)</p>

<p>For example if you have a directory structure like:</p>

<pre><code>myPackage/
    myapp/
       moduleA/
          __init__.py
          module_A.py
       moduleB/
          __init__.py
          module_B.py
setup.py
</code></pre>

<p>After adding test folder you will have a directory structure like:</p>

<pre><code>myPackage/
    myapp/
       moduleA/
          __init__.py
          module_A.py
       moduleB/
          __init__.py
          module_B.py
test/
   unit/
      myapp/
         moduleA/
            module_A_test.py
         moduleB/
            module_B_test.py
   integration/
          myapp/

                module_A_test.py
             moduleB/
                module_B_test.py
setup.py

I end up putting my test modules somewhere beside the core modules. </p>

<p>The main reason for doing this is: <strong>refactoring</strong>.</p>

<p>When I move things around I do want test modules to move with the code; it's easy to lose tests if they are in a separate tree. Let's be honest, sooner or later you end up with a totally different folder structure, like <a href=""https://github.com/django/django"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">django</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/pallets/flask"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flask</a> and many others. Which is fine if you don't care.</p>

<p>The main question you should ask yourself is this:  </p>

<p>Am I writing:  </p>

<ul>
<li>a) reusable library or  </li>
<li>b) building a project than bundles together some semi-separated modules?</li>
</ul>

<p>If a: </p>

<p>A separate folder and the extra effort to maintain its structure may be better suited. No one will complain about your tests getting <em>deployed to production</em>. </p>

<p>But it's also just as easy to exclude tests from being distributed when they are mixed with the core folders; <a href=""http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html?highlight=find_packages#using-find-packages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">put this in the setup.py</a>:</p>

<pre><code>find_packages(""src"", exclude=[""*.tests"", ""*.tests.*"", ""tests.*"", ""tests""]) 
</code></pre>

<p>If b: </p>

<p>You may wish — as every one of us do — that you are writing reusable libraries, but most of the time their life is tied to the life of the project. Ability to easily maintain your project should be a priority. </p>

<p>Then if you did a good job and your module is a good fit for another project, it will probably get copied — not forked or made into a separate library — into this new project, and moving tests that lay beside it in the same folder structure is easy in comparison to fishing up tests in a mess that a separate test folder had become. (You may argue that it shouldn't be a mess in the first place but let's be realistic here).</p>

<p>So the choice is still yours, but I would argue that with mixed up tests you achieve all the same things as with a separate folder, but with less effort on keeping things tidy.    </p>

<code>exec</code> allows you to execute arbitrary code in either the global scope, or in an internal scope, provided as a dictionary.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a module stored in <code>""/path/to/module</code>"" with the function <code>foo()</code>, you could run it by doing the following:</p>

<pre><code>module = dict()
with open(""/path/to/module"") as f:
    exec(f.read(), module)
module['foo']()
</code></pre>

<p>This makes it a bit more explicit that you're loading code dynamically, and grants you some additional power, such as the ability to provide custom builtins. </p>

<p>And if having access through attributes, instead of keys is important to you, you can design a custom dict class for the globals, that provides such access, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>class MyModuleClass(dict):
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return self.__getitem__(name)

<pre><code>from importlib.util import spec_from_loader
from importlib.machinery import SourceFileLoader 

spec = spec_from_loader(""module.name"", SourceFileLoader(""module.name"", ""/path/to/file.py""))
mod = module_from_spec(spec)
spec.loader.exec_module(mod)
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage of encoding the path in an explicit <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.SourceFileLoader"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>SourceFileLoader</code></a> is that the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.machinery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">machinery</a> will not try to figure out the type of the file from the extension. This means that you can load something like a <code>.txt</code> file using this method, but you could not do it with <code>spec_from_file_location</code> without specifying the loader because <code>.txt</code> is not in <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>importlib.machinery.SOURCE_SUFFIXES</code></a>.</p>

<p>PySide has good documentation and <a href=""http://developer.qt.nokia.com/wiki/PySide_Tutorials_by_Experience_Level"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a>.</p>

<p>What you will want to do is create a QMainWindow instance and set the WindowFlags to your requirements. You probably want the following combination <code>Qt::Window | Qt::CustomizeWindowHint | Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint</code>.</p>

<p>Something like this: </p>

<pre><code>import sys
from PySide.QtCore import *
from PySide.QtGui import *

class Form(QMainWindow):

    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super(Form, self).__init__(parent)
        self.setWindowFlags(Qt::Window | Qt::CustomizeWindowHint | Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create the Qt Application
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    # Create and show the form
    form = Form()
    form.show()
    # Run the main Qt loop
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

"7828964","2","","7828867","2011-10-19 22:25:37","","4","","<p>The best way to do this is by sorting the lists and comparing them. (Using <code>Counter</code> won't work with objects that aren't hashable.) This is straightforward for integers:</p>

<pre><code>sorted(a) == sorted(b)
</code></pre>

<p>It gets a little trickier with arbitrary objects. If you care about object identity, i.e., whether the <em>same</em> objects are in both lists, you can use the <code>id()</code> function as the sort key.</p>

<pre><code>sorted(a, key=id) == sorted(b, key==id)
</code></pre>

<p>(In Python 2.x you don't actually need the <code>key=</code> parameter, because you can compare any object to any object. The ordering is arbitrary but stable, so it works fine for this purpose; it doesn't matter what order the objects are in, only that the ordering is the same for both lists. In Python 3, though, comparing objects of different types is disallowed in many circumstances -- for example, you can't compare strings to integers -- so if you will have objects of various types, best to explicitly use the object's ID.)</p>

<p>If you want to compare the objects in the list by <em>value,</em> on the other hand, first you need to define what ""value"" means for the objects. Then you will need some way to provide that as a key (and for Python 3, as a consistent type). One potential way that would work for a lot of arbitrary objects is to sort by their <code>repr()</code>. Of course, this could waste a lot of extra time and memory building <code>repr()</code> strings for large lists and so on.</p>

<pre><code>sorted(a, key=repr) == sorted(b, key==repr)
</code></pre>

<p>If the objects are all your own types, you can define <code>__lt__()</code> on them so that the object knows how to compare itself to others. Then you can just sort them and not worry about the <code>key=</code> parameter. Of course you could also define <code>__hash__()</code> and use <code>Counter</code>, which will be faster.</p>

And measuring the convert function, by changing the 'read' to always return a simple point, but calling the conversion and output the same number of times as if you were really reading the file.  (And probably another run where the final post-conversion output is a no-op.)  Depending on where the time is going, it may make a lot more sense to attack one or the other.</p>

<p>You might be able to get the local OS to do some interleaving for you by writing the output to the Python's stdout, and having the shell do the actual file IO.  And similarly by streaming the file into stdin (e.g., <code>cat oldformat | python conversion.py > outputfile</code>)</p>

<p>What sort of storage are the input and output files on?  The storage characteristics may have a lot more to do with the performance than the Python code.</p>

<p>Update: Given the output is the slowest, and your storage is pretty slow and shared between both reads and writes, try adding some buffering.  From <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#open"" rel=""nofollow"">the python doc</a> you should be able to add some buffering by adding a third argument to the <code>os.open</code> call.

You're then formatting that into and writing data which is perhaps five times as large. This means a total of 13 GB to read and write requiring 130-420 seconds.</p>

<p>Your sampling shows that reading takes 24 seconds. Writing should therefore require about two minutes. The reading and writing times can be improved using an SSD for example.</p>

<p>When I convert files (using programs I write in C) I assume that a conversion should take no more time than it takes to read the data itself, a lot less is usually possible. Overlapped reads and writes can also reduce the I/O time. I write my own custom formatting routines since printf is usually far too slow.</p>

<p>How much is 24 seconds? On a modern CPU at least 40 billion instructions. That means that in that time you can process every single byte of data with at least 19 instructions. Easily doable for a C program but not for an interpreted language (Python, Java, C#, VB).</p>

<p>Your 525 second processing (549-24) remainder indicates that Python is spending at least 875 billion instructions processing or 415 instructions per byte of data read.

So you wind up with <code>z = ZipFile(HttpFile(url))</code> and it dynamically downloads just the portion needed.  The advantage with this is you write less code, and it applies to more than just zip files.  (In fact, I wonder if there is something like this already... I'm not finding it though.)</p>

<pre><code>Update mytable set value1 = data1, value2 = data2 where somevalue = somedata;
</code></pre>

<p>If you used openoffice for this, then openoffice has this nifty Text to columns function (under data in program menu), which turns concactenated values into string. Then you can copypaste those strings into command prompt or phppgadmin and run.. and voila, you get updated data in your database.</p>

<p>Edit (In response to you comment.):</p>

<p>Look into this: <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#get-or-create"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#get-or-create</a></p>

<p>If you want to use django for this, then use get_or_create. But you need to remember here, that if any of the parameters you use in get_or_create method have changed, then new object will be created. Thats why i said in the beginning of the post, that you need some kind of data, which will not change.</p>

<p>for example (taken from the link above)</p>

<pre><code>obj, created = Person.objects.get_or_create(first_name='John', last_name='Lennon',
                  defaults={'birthday': date(1940, 10, 9)})
</code></pre>

<p>will create new obj(Person) when used first time. But if used 2nd time and the date has changed, then new Person with same name and last name but new date will be created.</p>

<p>So to avoid this, you'll still need to do something like</p>

<pre><code>obj.someothervalue = someotherdata
obj.save()
</code></pre>

<p>if you want to have more control over the data, that could have been changed.</p>

finally:

<p>If you play the resultant file in an audio player, you'll find that is 40 seconds in duration. If you run the code above it also computes the duration to be 40 seconds. So I believe the number of frames is not influenced by the number of channels and the formula above is correct. </p>

<p>I would first get network cards installed in everything.  If you want something that you can just plugin and go, look for any card compatible with NE2000.  That card will work out of the box on Windows 3.11 and 95, no problem.  In particular, you can find the 3Com EtherLink II or the 3C509B for very cheap online.  It's an excellent card.  (The Google Shopping results list several for under $20.)</p>

<p>From there, just enable the Windows File/Print Sharing service over TCP/IP, and you're good to go!  After you've done this, you can remotely manage and upgrade these machines, saving you a lot of headache later on.</p>

<h2>Serial-Port Method</h2>

<p>Deanna's suggestion of using the serial port as a network device and transferring files normally will work as well.  However, there is a bit of setup involved, and it can be a hassle if you've never done it.  There are several other software options.  I recommend <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B000E5RC16"" rel=""nofollow"">LapLink</a>.  It's fairly painless.</p>

<p>You could even go all-out and pickup a multi-port serial interface for fairly cheap these days, and manage these computers centrally.  RS232 is very robust and can go a long distance over the proper cabling.</p>

<p><strong>Networking over Ethernet is the way to go though.  If at all possible, choose that option.</strong></p>

  <p>I'll try to be brief. Well.. I always try to be brief, but my level of success is pretty much random.randint(0, never). So yeah.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol. You even failed to be brief about announcing that you will try to be brief.</p>

<p>First, we need to be clear about what ""called into being"" means. Presumably you want a new hammer every time <code>self.tool = object</code> happens. You don't want a new instance every time, for example, you access the tool attribute, or you'd always a get a new, presumably unbroken, hammer every time you check <code>self.tool.broken</code>.</p>

<p>A couple approaches.</p>

<p>One, give Tool a copy method that produces a new object that should equal the original object, but be a different instance. For example:</p>

<pre><code>class Tool:

    def __init__(self, kind):
        self.kind = kind
        self.broken = False

    def copy(self):
        result = Tool(self.kind)
        result.broken = self.broken
        return result
</code></pre>

<p>Then in Student's init you say</p>

<pre><code>    self.tool = tool.copy()
</code></pre>

<p>Option two, use a factory function.</p>

<pre><code>def makehammer():
    return Tool(hammer)

class Student:
    def __init__(self, factory):
        self.tool = factory()

Billy = Student(makehammer)
</code></pre>

<p>I can't think any way in Python that you can write the line <code>self.tool = object</code> and have object automagically make a copy, and I don't think you want to. One thing I like about Python is WYSIWYG. If you want magic use C++. I think it makes code hard to understand when you not only can't tell what a line of code is doing, you can't even tell it's doing <em>anything</em> special.</p>

<p>Note you can get even fancier with a factory <em>object</em>. For example:</p>

<pre><code>class RealisticFactory:
    def __init__(self, kind, failurerate):
        self.kind = kind
        self.failurerate = failurerate

    def make(self):
        result = Tool(self.kind)
        if random.random() &lt; self.failurerate:
            result.broken = True
        if (self.failurerate &lt; 0.01):
            self.failurerate += 0.0001
        return result

factory = RealisticFactory(hammer, 0.0007)
Billy = Student(factory.make)
Tommy = Student(factory.make) # Tommy's tool is slightly more likely to be broken

<p>I will restate my own question as the answer.  Suppose I have this tiny program:</p>

<pre><code>class Item(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.broken = False

    def smash(self):
        print ""This object broke.""
        self.broken = True

class Person(object):
    def __init__(self, holding):
        self.holding = holding

    def using(self):
        if self.holding.broken != True:
            print ""Pass.""
        else:
            print ""Fail.""

Foo = Person(Item())
Bar = Person(Item())

Foo.holding.smash()
Foo.using()
Bar.using()
</code></pre>

<p>The program will return ""Fail"" for Foo.using() and ""Pass"" for Bar.using().  Upon <em>actually thinking about what I'm doing</em>, ""Foo.holding = Item()"" and ""Bar.holding = Item()"" are clearly different instances.  I even ran this dumpy program to prove it worked as I surmised it did, and no surprises to you pros, it does.  So I withdraw my question on the basis that I <em>wasn't actually using my brain when I asked it</em>.  The funny thing is, with the program I've been working on, I was already doing it this way but assuming it was the wrong way to do it.  So thanks for humoring me.</p>

<p>This recipe is useful where you'd like some way to send jobs to a daemon, but don't want to use some IPC mechanism such as sockets or pipes. Instead, the daemon can sit and watch a submission directory, and jobs can be submitted by dropping a file or directory into the submission directory.</p>

<p>Locking is not taken into account. The watch_directories() function itself doesn't really need to do locking; if it misses a modification on one pass, it'll notice it on the next pass. However, if jobs are written directly into a watched directory, the callable object might start running while a job file is only half-written. To solve this, you can use a lockfile; the callable must acquire the lock when it runs, and submitters must acquire the lock when they wish to add a new job. A simpler approach is to rely on the rename() system call being atomic: write the job into a temporary directory that isn't being watched, and once the file is complete use os.rename() to move it into the submission directory.</p>

The difference between <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Jo\xc3\xa3o'</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'Jo\xc3\xa3o'</code> is that the former calls <code>repr</code> on the object, while the latter calls <code>str</code> (or probably <code>unicode</code>, in your case). It's just how the string is represented.</p>

<p>Some examples might make this more clear:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'Jo\xc3\xa3o'.decode('utf-8')
João
&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Jo\xc3\xa3o'.decode('utf-8')
u'Jo\xe3o'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print repr('Jo\xc3\xa3o'.decode('utf-8'))
u'Jo\xe3o'

<p>Notice how the second and third result are identical. The original <code>ldap_username</code> currently is an ASCII string. You can see this on the Python prompt: when it is displaying an ACSII object, it shows as <code>'ASCII string'</code>, while Unicode objects are shown as <code>u'Unicode string'</code> -- the key being the leading <code>u</code>.</p>

<p>So, as your <code>ldap_username</code> reads as <code>'Jo\xc3\xa3o'</code>, and is an ASCII string, the following applies:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Jo\xc3\xa3o'.decode('utf-8')
u'Jo\xe3o'
&gt;&gt;&gt; print 'Jo\xc3\xa3o'.decode('utf-8') # To Unicode...
João
&gt;&gt;&gt; u'João'.encode('utf-8')             # ... back to ASCII
'Jo\xc3\xa3o'
</code></pre>

<p>Summed up: you need to determine the type of the string (use <code>type</code> when unsure), and based on that, decode to Unicode, or encode to ASCII.</p>

Hence <code>'(.*)'</code> might mean something to a function, although it means nothing to Python itself. Since</p>

<p>Two functions that do take strings containing (.*) are <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/glob.html"" rel=""nofollow"">glob.glob</a>, <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/fnmatch.html"" rel=""nofollow"">fnmatch.fnmatch</a> and the re modules functions.</p>

<p>In glob and fnmatch it is <code>'*'</code> that has special meaning, it means ""anything"". You typically use it to match filenames:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import glob
&gt;&gt;&gt; glob.glob('/tmp/foobar.*')
['/tmp/foobar.tmp', '/tmp/foobar.txt', '/tmp/foobar.conf']
</code></pre>

<p>And you can also list everything with a specific ending:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import glob
&gt;&gt;&gt; glob.glob('/tmp/*.txt')
['/tmp/foobar.txt', '/tmp/frotz.txt', '/tmp/wfsh.txt']
</code></pre>

<p>Hence, in these modules <code>'(.*)'</code> would mean anything starts with (. and ends with ) with anything in between it.</p>

<p>In the re module you handle regular expressions. regular expressions is a highly magical text matching language. There <code>'.'</code> means ""any character (except newlines, unless you set a special flag to make it mean newlines as well)"", and '*' means ""zero to infinite amount of repetitions of the previous match"". Hence <code>'.*'</code> means ""pretty much anything"", and is a common thing to stick into regular expressions, as <code>'foobar.*'</code> would mean anything that start with foobar.</p>

<p>Parenthesis means ""groups"", and to know what that mean you'll just have to read the <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/re.html"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a>. You probably won't get it without some experimentation so you see what happens.</p>

<p>Basically '(.*)' matches anything. I'm assuming your regular expression has text before and after it as well?</p>

Here is an example</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import uncertainties
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = uncertainties.ufloat('12.000')
&gt;&gt;&gt; x
12.0+/-0.001

<p>The <a href=""http://packages.python.org/uncertainties/"" rel=""nofollow"">uncertainties</a> module transparently handles uncertainties (precision) for you, whatever the complexity of the mathematical expressions involved.</p>

<hr>

<p>The <a href=""http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">decimal</a> module, on the other hand, does not handle uncertainties, but instead sets the number of digits after the decimal point: <strong>you can't trust all the digits given by the decimal module</strong>.  Thus,</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 100*decimal.Decimal('12.1')
Decimal('1210.0')
</code></pre>

<p>whereas 100*(12.1±0.1) = 1210±10 (not 1210.0±0.1):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; 100*uncertainties.ufloat('12.1')
1210.0+/-10.0
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the decimal module gives '1210.0' even though the precision on 100*(12.1±0.1) is 100 times larger than 0.1.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, if you want numbers that have a fixed number of digits after the decimal point (like for accounting applications), the decimal module is good; if you instead need to perform calculations with uncertainties, then the <a href=""http://packages.python.org/uncertainties/"" rel=""nofollow"">uncertainties</a> module is appropriate.</p>

<p>On a cold cache, <code>git grep foo</code> (which returned 1656 entries, far more than idutils):</p>

<pre><code>$ time git grep foo &gt; /dev/null

real    0m19.231s
user    0m1.480s
sys     0m0.680s
</code></pre>

<p>Once the cache was warm, <code>git grep foo</code> runs much faster:</p>

<pre><code>$ time git grep foo &gt; /dev/null

real    0m0.264s
user    0m1.320s
sys     0m0.330s
</code></pre>

<p>Because my dataset fits entirely in RAM once the cache is warm, <code>git grep</code> is pretty amazing: it's only seven times slower than the <code>gid(1)</code> utility and certainly it would be more than fast enough for interactive use. If the dataset in question cannot be entirely cached (which is probably where things actually get interesting) then the performance benefit of the index is unmistakable.</p>

<p>The two complaints about idutils:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No pagination. This is definitely a downside, though in my experience it runs quickly enough to simply store the results of the search elsewhere. If the search is going to return an appreciable percentage of the original dataset, then storage of partial results is definitely going to be annoying.</p></li>
<li><p>No API: true enough, there's no API. But the source is available; <code>src/lid.c</code> function <code>report_grep()</code> takes a linked list of files that match the output. A little fiddling with this function should even offer pagination. (It would take some doing.) At the end of the day, you'd have a C API, which might still not be ideal. But customizing it doesn't look awful.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, the weakness that is probably worst is the lack of an incremental database update. If <em>all</em> files are updated three times per day, this is not a big deal. If <em>some</em> files are updated three times a day, it is doing needless work. If a handful of files are updated three times a day, there must be a better solution.</p>

<p>The command line client works like this:</p>

<pre><code>ws-update -b --index my.idx datadir  # build the index
ws-update -b --append --index my.idx datadir  # incremental update
ws --index my.idx hello world     # query the index
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>-b</code> is for batch updating, which is faster but requires more memory. For the full CLI syntax use <code>--help</code>.)</p>

<p>It does not come close to the speed of GNU id utils, but by updating the index using several incremental batch (in-memory) updates it's fast enough for us.</p>

"15675120","2","","15670559","2013-03-28 05:52:08","","2","","<p>Installing a module from a git repository in the usual ways <em>does</em> require a <code>setup.py</code>, but it can be a bare minimum one rather than a fuller one like you'd use for a PyPI module. For example:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python

from distutils.core import setup

setup(
    name=""foo"",
)
</code></pre>

<p>If you drop something like that into each of your lib repositories then you can make your requirements file point to the git repo using <code>-e git://git.example.com/foo.git#egg=foo</code>. If you install this into a virtualenv then it will appear at <code>src/foo</code> inside the virtualenv directory, and it'll be added to <code>sys.path</code> automatically when running Python from that virtualenv.</p>

<p>The <code>-e</code> option also accepts a local directory as a parameter, so if you guarantee that the current working directory will always be the root of your project when you install from <code>requirements.txt</code> (so that the relative path resolves correctly) it should work just fine to write things like <code>-e lib1</code> in there, and then you can still reference the libraries as git submodules if you want.</p>

<p>If you are determined <em>not</em> to create a <code>setup.py</code> then your task is to emulate what would happen when running <code>python setup.py develop</code>. This command does two things (as of Python 2.7, at least):</p>

<ul>
<li>It creates an <a href=""http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/setuptools/doc/formats.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">egg link</a> in the <code>site-packages</code> lib directory in your virtualenv (or system-wide if you don't have a virtualenv) that points to your target source directory.</li>
<li>It adds a line to <code>easy-install.pth</code>, which is also in the <code>site-packages</code> directory, which also points to your target source directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>You could choose to do both of the above actions by a means other than running <code>setup.py editable</code> and get the same effect for current versions of Python, but of course the implementation of editable distributions may change in newer versions of Python.</p>

<p>I normally wouldn't even mention this, but since you tagged your question ""optimization"", I guess you care: This code is theoretically faster than yours for reasons that should be pretty obvious, but in real life, it will almost always make no difference. According to <code>%timeit</code> on my machine, the part after the <code>read</code>/<code>readline</code> takes 244ns instead of 2.6us. That's more than 10x as fast, as you'd expect. But the <code>read</code>/<code>readline</code> part takes 13.1us vs. 13.2us for a file is in the OS disk cache, or 39.7ms vs. 39.7ms for a file on a remote drive. The I/O cost of reading a block from a file into a buffer, even in the best case, swamps the cost of processing it (both the extra processing in <code>readline</code>, and the extra processing in your code).</p>

It is used to check a sequence of values, and see if any of them is ""true"". That's not related to finding out if a value is ""any number"" or ""any of these possibilities"".</p>

<p>If you have a fixed, finite <code>set</code> of possibilities that you want to consider, then what you really want to know is whether your candidate value is <code>in</code> that set:</p>

<pre><code>x in {1, 2, 3, 4, ""hi mom""} # returns whether x is any of those values
</code></pre>

<p>But ""any number"" is not a finite set. First off, you need to define what you mean by <em>number</em>; and then you need to perform the appropriate test. It sounds like what you are trying to do is check whether the value is an integer. In other words, you are concerned with the <em>type</em> of the values in the list.</p>

<p>If you already <strong>know</strong> they're all integers, then there's nothing to test; if you don't care what the value is, then just don't consider it when you make your checks. But if you need to be sure it's an integer, then the way to do that is</p>

<pre><code>isinstance(x, int) # returns whether x is an `int`
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>But maybe you have confused <strong>me</strong>, by giving an example ""to-search list"" that happens to be the same length as your ""pattern"", when you actually want to look for the pattern at any point in a longer list.</p>

<p>In that case, you can make a function that does an exact match of the pattern against a list of the same length; and then use <code>any</code> to check whether any pattern-lengthed sublist matches. <code>any</code> is designed to be used with generator expressions, and it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def match(a_sublist, the_pattern):
    # put your logic here

def search(the_full_list, the_pattern):
    pattern_length, full_length = len(the_pattern), len(the_full_list)
    return any(
        match(the_full_list[i:i+pattern_length], the_pattern)
        for i in range(full_length - pattern_length)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>There are more efficient ways to match, depending on the details of your pattern, that will be inspired by string search algorithms and regular expression engines. But that is getting into much more difficult material - the above should get you started.</p>

<p>Briefly speaking,if it is only reading from a name, and the name doesn't exist locally, it will try to look up the name in any containing scopes.That's what happens to <code>temp</code>,which will be found in the global scope.But with <code>hhh</code>,you do writing,which will make Python believe that <code>hhh</code> is a local variable.  </p>

<p>And another thing,but more important,it is not recomended using <code>global</code>.You could invoke <code>actualcrawl()</code> in <code>start()</code>,and pass in <code>hhh,temp</code>,which is the way most people do.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>It is simple:</p>

<pre><code>import random,os

    hhh='[X'

<p>First, you're using <code>pack</code> and <code>place</code>.  In general, you should only use 1 geometry manager within a container widget.  I don't recommend using <code>place</code>.  That's just too much work that you need to manage.</p>

<p>Second, you're calling the callback <code>movedown</code> when you construct your button.  That's not what you want to do -- You want to pass the function, not the result of the function:</p>

<pre><code>buttonup = Button(window, text = 'down', width = 5, command = movedown)
</code></pre>

<p>Third, <code>globals</code> returns a dictionary of the current namespace -- It's not likely to have an integer key in it.  To get the reference to the object referenced by <code>b</code>, you'd need <code>globals()[""b""]</code>.  Even if it did, changing the value of <code>b</code> in the global namespace won't change the position of your label because the label has no way of knowing that change.  And in general, if you <em>need</em> to use <code>globals</code>, you <em>probably</em> need to rethink your design.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example of how I would do it...</p>

<pre><code>import Tkinter as tk

def window(root):
    buf_frame = tk.Frame(root,height=0)
    buf_frame.pack(side='top')
    label = tk.Label(root,text=""Hello World"")
    label.pack(side='top')
    def movedown():
        buf_frame.config(height=buf_frame['height']+22)

    button = tk.Button(root,text='Push',command=movedown)
    button.pack(side='top')

root = tk.Tk()

<p>Essentially, It is much better, in this case, to use a Canvas instead of a label. With canvases, you can move objects with canvas.move, here is a simple example program </p>

<pre><code># Python 2
from Tkinter import *

# For Python 3 use:
#from tkinter import *

root = Tk()
root.geometry('500x500+100+100')

image1 = PhotoImage(file = 'Image.gif')

canvas = Canvas(root, width = 500, height = 400, bg = 'white')
canvas.pack()
imageFinal = canvas.create_image(300, 300, image = image1)

def move():
    canvas.move(imageFinal, 0, 22)  
    canvas.update()

button = Button(text = 'move', height = 3, width = 10, command = move)
button.pack(side = 'bottom', padx = 5, pady = 5)

root.mainloop()

<p>It seems that this option is only available in Eclipse's Java Editor.</p>

<p>The Java editor allows you to create ""profiles"" for the code formatter, while PyDev's options for the code formatter are very limited.</p>

<h2>However,</h2>

<p>You can hack this. <code>PythonTidy.py</code> is an awesome script that cleans up Python code to make it follow PEP8 conventions, and that can be tweaked with your own settings. </p>

<h2>PythonTidy (code cleanup &amp; formatting)</h2>

<p>Get <a href=""http://lacusveris.com/PythonTidy/PythonTidy-1.22.python"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> (<a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonTidy/"" rel=""noreferrer"">homepage</a>) the source for <strong>PythonTidy</strong>. </p>

<p>You will see inside the file, at the beginning of the code and just after the comments, that many settings are defined. </p>

<p>The first one of these is <code>COL_LIMIT</code> with its default value set to <code>72</code>. Now you can use <strong>PythonTidy</strong> to format your code the way you want.</p>

<h2>Integration with PyDev</h2>

<p>Now you have to make this work with PyDev's formatting. This <a href=""http://bear330.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/using-pythontidy-in-pydev-as-code-formatter/"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog post</a> will explain it really better than me, but still I'll sum up the steps :</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a Jython interface betwenn PyDev's editor (<strong>PyEdit</strong>) and <strong>PythonTidy</strong>. This blog's author already wrote a wrapper script in the public domain available in the above link or <a href=""http://pastebin.com/sXDkNT84"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> in case the link goes 404.</li>
<li>Save this file anywhere you want, with the name <code>pyedit_pythontidy.py</code>, along with the <code>PythonTidy.py</code> file.</li>
<li><p>Configure PyDev to use this script as its <em>Code Formatter</em>. You can do this in <strong>Preferences > PyDev > Scripting PyDev</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Note #1: I really recommend reading the original <a href=""http://bear330.wordpress.com/2007/10/30/using-pythontidy-in-pydev-as-code-formatter/"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog post</a> to have a better understanding</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Note #2: The wrapper script author did not implement <strong>Code Block formatting</strong>, so this means you can only format a full file. This should not be that hard to implement, up to you.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Note #3: All credits goes to <a href=""http://bear330.wordpress.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">bear330</a> for the <strong>PyDev integration</strong> part.</em></p></li>

"15688085","2","","15679719","2013-03-28 17:15:04","","2","","<p>You are basically reinventing the indexing scheme of a multidimensional array. It is relatively easy to code, but you can use the two functions <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.unravel_index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>unravel_index</code></a> and <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ravel_multi_index.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ravel_multi_index</code></a> to your advantage here.</p>

<p>If your grid is of <code>M</code> rows and <code>N</code> columns, to get the <code>idx</code> and <code>idy</code> of a single item you could do:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; M, N = 12, 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.unravel_index(4, dims=(M, N))
(0, 4)
</code></pre>

<p>This also works if, instead of a single index, you provide an array of indices:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; np.unravel_index([15, 28, 32, 97], dims=(M, N))
(array([1, 2, 3, 9], dtype=int64), array([5, 8, 2, 7], dtype=int64))
</code></pre>

<p>So if <code>cells</code> has the indices of several cells you want to find neighbors to:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cells = np.array([15, 28, 32, 44, 87])
</code></pre>

<p>You can get their neighbors as:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; idy, idx = np.unravel_index(cells, dims=(M, N))
&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_idx = np.vstack((idx-1, idx+1, idx, idx))
&gt;&gt;&gt; neigh_idy = np.vstack((idy, idy, idy-1, idy+1))
&gt;&gt;&gt; np.ravel_multi_index((neigh_idy, neigh_idx), dims=(M,N))
array([[14, 27, 31, 43, 86],
       [16, 29, 33, 45, 88],
       [ 5, 18, 22, 34, 77],
       [25, 38, 42, 54, 97]], dtype=int64)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you prefer it like that:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; np.ravel_multi_index((neigh_idy, neigh_idx), dims=(M,N)).T
array([[14, 16,  5, 25],
       [27, 29, 18, 38],
       [31, 33, 22, 42],
       [43, 45, 34, 54],
       [86, 88, 77, 97]], dtype=int64)
</code></pre>

<p>The nicest thing about going this way is that <code>ravel_multi_index</code> has a <code>mode</code> keyword argument you can use to handle items on the edges of your lattice, see the docs.</p>

<pre><code>In [6]: a.ndim
Out[6]: 1

In [7]: b.ndim
Out[7]: 2
</code></pre>

<p>So, <code>b</code> is a 2D array.
You also see this in the output of <code>b.shape</code>: (1,3) indicates two dimensions as (3,) is one dimension.</p>

<p>The behaviour of <code>np.dot</code> is different for 1D and 2D arrays (from the <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">docs</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For 2-D arrays it is equivalent to matrix multiplication, and for 1-D
  arrays to inner product of vectors</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the reason you get different results, because you are mixing 1D and 2D arrays. Since <code>b</code> is a 2D array, <code>np.dot(b, b)</code> tries a matrix multiplication on two 1x3 matrices, which fails.</p>

<hr>

<p>With 1D arrays, np.dot does a inner product of the vectors:</p>

<pre><code>In [44]: a = np.array([1,2,3])

In [45]: b = np.array([1,2,3])

In [46]: np.dot(a, b)
Out[46]: 14

In [47]: np.inner(a, b)
Out[47]: 14
</code></pre>

<p>With 2D arrays, it is a matrix multiplication (so 1x3 x 3x1 = 1x1, or 3x1 x 1x3 = 3x3):</p>

<pre><code>In [49]: a = a.reshape(1,3)

In [50]: b = b.reshape(3,1)

In [51]: a
Out[51]: array([[1, 2, 3]])

In [52]: b
Out[52]:
array([[1],
       [2],
       [3]])

In [53]: np.dot(a,b)
Out[53]: array([[14]])

In [54]: np.dot(b,a)
Out[54]:
array([[1, 2, 3],

"15682527","2","","15680809","2013-03-28 13:01:54","","0","","<p>Personally, I'd store an rrule object from python-dateutil (<a href=""http://labix.org/python-dateutil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labix.org/python-dateutil</a>) rather than inventing your own recurrence format. Then you can just define some methods that use <code>rrule. between(after, before)</code> to generate instances of your event object for a given range.</p>

<p>One catch though, dateutil's rrule object <em>doesn't pickle correctly</em>, so you should define your own mechanism of serialising the object to the database. I've generally gone with a JSON representation of the keyword arguments for instantiating the rrule. The annoying edge case is that if you want to store stuff like '2nd Monday of the month', you have to do additional work with MO(2), because the value it returns isn't useful. It's hard to explain, but you'll see the problem when you try it.</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any efficient way to find all eligible events within a range though, you'll have to load in all the Event models that potentially overlap with the range. So you'll always be loading in potentially more data than you'll eventually use. Just make sure relatively smart about it to reduce the burden. Short of someone adding recurrence handling to databases themselves, I'm not aware of any way to improve this.</p>

Doing <code>rc[0]</code>, or any sort of indexing, generates and returns a DirectView object that's a view with whatever engines you specify in []. This is a shorthand for generating the views: it's not actually just getting a specific object.</p>

<p>Thus, those views aren't unique. The best way to explain it, I think, is with an example. Say you have 2 engines. You want to run some tasks on only engine one, and want the tasks to block. You want to run others on only engine one, but don't want them to block. You want to run yet more on engines 1 and 2, and don't want them to block. Then you could do:</p>

<pre><code>view_1_block = rc[0]
view_1_block.block = True
view_2_noblock = rc[0]
view_2_noblock.block = False
view_3_noblock = rc[[0,1]]
view_3_noblock.block = False
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can use these to run tasks in whatever way you'd like, eg</p>

<pre><code>view_1_block.map(lambda x:x**10, range(32)) # blocks, returns results, runs only on 1
view_3_noblock.map(lambda x:x**10, range(32)) # does not block, returns AsyncResult, runs on 1 and 2
</code></pre>

<p>There's no actual magic being used here. When you run rc[0] twice, it generates two views. The second view is not the same as the first. When you assign rc[0] to a variable, and then use that variable, you're working with one view, and not creating a new one. </p>

<p>iPython, like Numpy and Scipy, has quite a few shorthand notations that don't necessarily fit Python's idioms perfectly. This is especially the case with [] and getitem. A purer Python way of writing this could would be to use the much more unwieldy <code>rc.direct_view(1)</code>, and so on, which would make clear that this wasn't just getting an item, and was actually creating a view.</p>

<p>The default for instances of custom classes is to create a new, empty class, swap out the <code>__class__</code> attribute, then for shallow copies, just update the <code>__dict__</code> on the copy with the values from the original. A deep copy recurses over the <code>__dict__</code> instead.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you specify a <code>__getstate__()</code> method to return internal state. This can be any structure that your class <code>__setstate__()</code> can accept again.</p>

<p>You can also specify the <code>__copy__()</code> and/or <code>__deepcopy__()</code> methods to control <em>just</em> copy behaviour. These methods are expected to do all the copying themselves, the <code>__deepcopy__()</code> method is passed a memo mapping to pass on to recursive <code>deepcopy()</code> calls.</p>

<p>An example could be:</p>

<pre><code>from copy import deepcopy

class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, bar):
        self.bar = bar
        self.spam = expression + that * generates - ham   # calculated

    def __copy__(self):
        # self.spam is to be ignored, it is calculated anew for the copy
        # create a new copy of ourselves *reusing* self.bar
        return type(self)(self.bar)

    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):
        # self.spam is to be ignored, it is calculated anew for the copy
        # create a new copy of ourselves with a deep copy of self.bar
        # pass on the memo mapping to recursive calls to copy.deepcopy
        return type(self)(deepcopy(self.bar, memo))
</code></pre>

<p>This example defines custom copy hooks to prevent <code>self.spam</code> being copied too, as a new instance will calculate it anew.</p>

<p>Generally there is an ""idle"" process/task that runs at the lowest priority and hence always gets control when there's nothing else to do.  Many older systems would simply have this process run a ""do forever"" loop with nothing of consequence in the loop body.  One OS I heard of would run machine diagnostics in the idle process.  A number of early PCs would run a memory refresh routine (since memory needed to be cycled regularly or it would ""evaporate"").</p>

<p>(A benefit of this scheme is that 100% minus the % CPU used by the idle process gives you the % CPU utilization -- a feature that was appreciated by OS designers.)</p>

<p>But the norm on most modern systems is to either run a ""halt"" or ""wait"" instruction or have a special flag in the process control block that even more directly tells the processor to simply stop running and go into power-saving mode.</p>

<h3>Idle thread functioality</h3>

<p>Tasks may vary between architectures, but generally these are the tasks performed by idle threads:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable interrupts to allow pending interrupts be delivered</li>
<li>Disable interrupts (using <code>STI</code> or <code>CLI</code> instructions, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_flag"" rel=""nofollow"">more on wiki</a>)</li>
<li>On the <code>DEBUG</code> (or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/hardware/ff543450%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">checked</a>) builds, query if a kernel debugger is attached and allow breakpoints if been requested</li>
<li>Handle deferred procedure calls</li>
<li>Check if there are any runnable threads ready for execution. If there is one, update the idle processor control block with a pointer to the thread</li>
<li>Check the queues of other processors, if possible schedule thread awaiting execution on the idle processor</li>
<li>Call a power management routine, which may halt a processor or downgrade CPU tick rate and do other similar power saving activities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional info</h3>

<p>When there are no runnable threads for a logical processor, Windows executes a kernel-mode idle thread. There is only 1 Idle process that has as many idle threads as there are logical processors. So on a Quad core machine with 4 logical/physical processors, there will be 1 Idle process and 4 idle threads.</p>

<p>In Windows, Idle process has ID = 0, so do all the Idle threads. These objects are represented by standard <code>EPROCESS/KPROCESS</code> and <code>ETHREAD/KTHREAD</code> data structures. But they are not executive manager processes and threads objects. There are no user-land address space and no user-land code is executed..</p>

<p>Idle process is statically allocated at system boot time before the process manager and object manager are set up. Idle thread structures are allocated dynamically as logical processors are brought live.</p>

<p>Idle thread priority is set to 0. However, this value doesn't actually matter as this thread only gets executed when there are no other threads available to run. Idle thread priority is never compared with priority of any other threads.</p>

<p>Idle threads are also special cases for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_%28computing%29"" rel=""nofollow"">preemption</a>. The idle thread main routine <code>KiIdleLoop</code> (<a href=""http://doxygen.reactos.org/d8/dc0/ntoskrnl_2ke_2amd64_2stubs_8c_ac8f6ede68a6bffcf075696a6c8d36ce9.html#ac8f6ede68a6bffcf075696a6c8d36ce9"" rel=""nofollow"">implementation</a> from <a href=""http://reactos.org"" rel=""nofollow"">reactos</a>) performs several tasks that are not interrupted by other threads. When there are no runnable threads available to run on a processor, that processor is marked as idle in a processor control block. Then if a runnable threads arrives to the queue scheduled for execution, that thread's address pointer is stored in the <code>NextThread</code> pointer of the idle processor control block. During the run of an idle thread, this pointer address gets checked on every iteration inside a <code>while</code> loop.</p>

Using the <code>operator</code> versions has a place, when you can replace <code>lambda a, b: a &lt; b</code> with the more compact <code>operator.lt</code>, but not much outside of that. And you really shouldn't be using explicit calls to the corresponding ufunc, unless you want to use the <code>out</code> parameter to store the calculated values directly in an existing array.</p>

<p>That said, if what you are worried is performance, you should do fair comparisons, because as you say, all your calls are eventually handled by numpy's <code>less</code> ufunc.</p>

<p>If your data is already in a numpy array, then you have already shown that they are all performing similarly, so go with the <code>&lt;</code> operator for clarity.</p>

<p>What if your data is in a python object, say a list? Well, here are some timings for you to ponder:</p>

<pre><code>In [13]: x = range(10**5)

In [19]: %timeit [j &lt; 5000 for j in x]
100 loops, best of 3: 5.32 ms per loop

In [20]: %timeit np.less(x, 5000)
100 loops, best of 3: 11.3 ms per loop

In [21]: %timeit [operator.lt(j, 5000) for j in x]
100 loops, best of 3: 16.2 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure why <code>operator.lt</code> is so slow, but you clearly want to stay away from it. If you want to get a numpy array as output from a Python object input, then this will probably be the fastest:</p>

<pre><code>In [22]: %timeit np.fromiter((j &lt; 5000 for j in x), dtype=bool, count=10**5)
100 loops, best of 3: 7.91 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Note that ufuncs operating on numpy arrays are <strong>much</strong> faster than any of the above:</p>

<pre><code>In [24]: y = np.array(x)

In [25]: %timeit y &lt; 5000

If you are using an OS X server hosting environment, then maybe you're talking about Framework with a Capital F.  However, OS X server hosting isn't a very common environment so I'm guessing that's not it.</p>

<p>If you just want to know how to install a Python library in your home directory, then the general answer is:</p>

<pre><code>$ python setup.py install --user
</code></pre>

<p>This Just Works™ on Python 2.7 (assuming the package uses distutils, which Twisted does, and you unpack the source .tar.gz and change your working directory to the directory that is the root of the contents of that .tar.gz), so you should be done after that.</p>

If you're just formatting a literal string, that isn't an issue, but if you ever may have untrusted format strings, you have to think very carefully about what you're doing—and it's easier to just not do it.</p>

<p>The more minor problem is that some of your code's readers won't understand <code>locals</code>, or the <code>**</code> syntax, and will have a hard time figuring out what it does or why it works. This isn't much of an argument. In fact, you could even say that a lot of Python's design decisions come down to making sure this is almost never a good argument—the language is exactly big enough that it's reasonable to expect your readers to understand/learn anything pythonic you write. But it's still worth thinking about.</p>

<p>Then there's the style issue. Every few months, someone comes along suggesting that the language should make it easier to do this, and it starts an argument on the mailing lists. Some people definitely think that this feels ""implicit rather than explicit"". Others disagree. I think it's pretty well settled that magic locals here would not be pythonic… but if you have to explicitly pass <code>locals()</code>, maybe that's fine and maybe it isn't. Like most style arguments that haven't gathered a consensus, it's really up to you. (By the way, the <code>format</code> API ultimately came out of an argument like this, where the original suggestion was for more-perl-like string interpolation with an implicit <code>locals</code>.)</p>

<p>But ultimately, you have to consider what you're saving. Compare this:</p>

<pre><code>filename = ""data/avatars/{player_name}.{ext}"".format(**locals())
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>filename = ""data/avatars/{0}.{1}"".format(player_name, ext)
</code></pre>

<p>Your version isn't clearer, more explicit, easier to type, or even shorter. So, I'd say the risk of making it a little harder for novices to read, and annoying to some segment of the community (even if it's for bad reasons), isn't worth it if there's no benefit.</p>

<p>One can also define a function to do that, but to access the right locals, it needs to do some frame handling</p>

<pre><code>def format_locals(string):
    return string.format(**sys._getframe().f_back.f_locals)

"16034387","2","","15693529","2013-04-16 10:15:00","","4","","<p>There are a number of ways you can achieve what you want. For example, one way is to make a custom initialiser for your handler:</p>

<pre><code>import os
import yaml

def logmaker():
    path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
    path = os.path.join(path, 'bot.log')
    return logging.FileHandler(path)

def main():
    # The file's path
    path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

    # Config file relative to this file
    loggingConf = open('{0}/logging.yml'.format(path), 'r')
    logging.config.dictConfig(yaml.load(loggingConf))
    loggingConf.close()
    logger = logging.getLogger('cloaked_chatter')
    logger.debug('Hello, world!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I moved the <code>logging.yml</code> to be adjacent to the script. The <code>logmaker</code> is the custom initialiser. Specify it in the YAML as follows:</p>

<pre><code>version: 1
formatters:
  default:
    format: '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s %(message)s'
handlers:
  console:
    class: logging.StreamHandler
    level: DEBUG
    formatter: default
    stream: ext://sys.stdout
  file:
    () : __main__.logmaker
    formatter: default
loggers:
  cloaked_chatter:
    level: DEBUG
    handlers: [console, file]
    propagate: no
</code></pre>

<p>If you run the Python script, you should find that the <code>bot.log</code> is created adjacent to the script and YAML file. The same message is printed to the console and <code>bot.log</code>:</p>

<pre><code>2013-04-16 11:08:11,178 DEBUG cloaked_chatter Hello, world!
</code></pre>

<p>N.B. The script could be a little tidier, but it illustrates my point.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> As per <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.config.html#user-defined-objects"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation</a>, the use of <code>()</code> as a key in dictionary indicates that the value is a callable which is essentially a custom constructor for the handler.</p>

The script that Jenkins was launching itself launched a threaded Python server using ThreadedTCPServer implemented more or less exactly from <a href=""http://docs.python.org/2/library/socketserver.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. That threaded server wasn't properly exiting, so it left some pipes open. Although the server process died, the leaky pipes made it impossible for Jenkins to properly determine that the process was over (Jenkins waits for an EOF from the child process to determine if the process completed). The solution was a reimplementation of the socket server that exited properly. Hope this helps someone in the future!</p>

If the log file was changing extremely rapidly then you could potentially risk being woken up almost constantly, which wouldn't necessarily be particularly efficient - however, you could always mitigate this by adding a short delay of your own after the inotify filehandle returns an event. In practice I doubt this would be an issue on most systems, but I thought it worth mentioning in case your system is very tight on CPU resources.</p>

<p>I can't see how the <code>sleep()</code> approach would miss file updates except in cases where the file is truncated or rotated (i.e. renamed and another file of the same name created). These are tricky cases to handle however you do things, and you can use tricks like periodically re-opening the file by name to check for rotation. Read the <code>tail</code> man page because it handles many such cases, and they're going to be quite common for log files in particular (log rotation being widely considered to be good practice).</p>

<p>The downside of <code>sleep()</code> is of course that you'd end up batching up your reads with delays in between, and also that you have the overhead of constantly waking up and polling the file even when it's not changing. If you did this, say, once per second, however, the overhead probably isn't noticeable on most systems.</p>

<p>I'd say inotify is the best choice unless you want to remain compatible, in which case the simple fallback using <code>sleep()</code> is still quite reasonable.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I just realised I forgot to mention - an easy way to check for a file being renamed is to perform an <code>os.fstat(fd.fileno())</code> on your open filehandle and a <code>os.stat()</code> on the filename you opened and compare the results. If the <code>os.stat()</code> fails then the error will tell you if the file's been deleted, and if not then comparing the <code>st_ino</code> (the inode number) fields will tell you if the file's been deleted and then replaced with a new one of the same name.</p>

<p>Detecting truncation is harder - effectively your read pointer remains at the same offset in the file and reading will return nothing until the file content size gets back to where you were - then the file will read from that point as normal. If you call <code>os.stat()</code> frequently you could check for the file size going backwards - alternatively you could use <code>fd.tell()</code> to record your current position in the file and then perform an explicit seek to the end of the file and call <code>fd.tell()</code> again. If the value is lower, then the file's been truncated under you. This is a safe operation as long as you keep the original file position around because you can always seek back to it after the check.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you're using inotify anyway, you could just watch the parent directory for changes.</p>

<p>Note that files can be truncated to non-zero sizes, but I doubt that's likely to happen to a log file - the common cases will be being deleted and replaced, or truncated to zero. Also, I don't know how you'd detect the case that the file was truncated and then immediately filled back up to beyond your current position, except by remembering the most recent N characters and comparing them, but that's a pretty grotty thing to do. I think inotify will just tell you the file has been modified in that case.</p>

<p>A good idea is the so called rights shedding: Start with root privilegs, then do what you nedd them for. Then become a less privileged user. <br />
You would use the os module for that:

<p>For example, run the following as root:</p>

This would filter out all the rows with max value in the group.</p>

<pre><code>In [365]: import pandas as pd

In [366]: df = pd.DataFrame({
'sp' : ['MM1', 'MM1', 'MM1', 'MM2', 'MM2', 'MM2', 'MM4', 'MM4','MM4'],

### Apply idxmax() and use .loc() on dataframe to filter the rows with max values:
In [368]: df.loc[df.groupby([""sp"", ""mt""])[""count""].idxmax()]                                                       
Out[368]: 
   count  mt   sp  val
0      3  S1  MM1    a
2      5  S3  MM1   cb
3      8  S3  MM2   mk
4     10  S4  MM2   bg
8      7  S2  MM4  uyi

### Just to show what values are returned by .idxmax() above:
In [369]: df.groupby([""sp"", ""mt""])[""count""].idxmax().values

<p>""<em>Returns the approximate processor time used by the process since the beginning of an implementation-defined era related to the program's execution. To convert result value to seconds divide it by CLOCKS_PER_SEC.</em>""</p>

<p>That's pretty vague. <code>CLOCK_PER_SEC</code> is set to <code>10^6</code> and the approximate stands for poor resolution, not that the current clocks tick over 1000 faster and the results are rounded. That might be not a very technical term, but it is appropriate. The actual resolution everywhere I tested was about 100Hz = 0,01s. It's been like that for years. Note date here <a href=""http://www.guyrutenberg.com/2007/09/10/resolution-problems-in-clock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guyrutenberg.com/2007/09/10/resolution-problems-in-clock/</a>. </p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's CPU time only. But 2 threads = 2*CPU time. See the example on cppreference.</p></li>
<li><p>It is not suited for fine grain measurements at all, as explained above. You were on the verge of its accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>IMO measuring wall-clock is the only sensible thing, but its a rather personal opinion. Especially with multithreaded applications and multiprocessing in general. Otherwise results of <code>system</code>+<code>user</code> should be similar anyways.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: At 3. This of course holds for computational tasks. If your process uses <code>sleep</code> or give up execution back to system, it might be more feasible measuring CPU time. Also regarding the comment that <code>clock</code> resolution is erm... bad. It is, but to be fair one could argue you should not measure such short computations. IMO its too bad, but if you measure times over few seconds I guess its fine. I would personally use others available tools.</p>

  <p>Setting the optimization flag certainly makes a big difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C++ is a language that begs to be compiled optimized, particularly so if the code in question uses containers and iterators from the C++ standard library. A simple <code>++iterator</code> shrinks from a good-sized chain of function calls when compiled unoptimized to one or two assembly statement when optimization is enabled.</p>

<p>That said, I knew what the compiler would do to your test code. Any decent optimizing compiler will make that <code>for (int i=0; i&lt;N; i++) continue;</code> loop vanish. It's the <em>as-if</em> rule at work. That loop does nothing, so the compiler is free to treat it as if it wasn't even there.</p>

<p>When I look at the CPU behavior of a suspect CPU hog, I write a simple driver (in a separate file) that calls the suspect function a number of times, sometimes a very large number of times. I compile the functionality to be tested with optimization enabled, but I compile the driver with optimization disabled. I don't want a too-smart optimizing compiler to see that those 100,000 calls to <code>function_to_be_tested()</code> can be pulled out of the loop and then further optimize the loop away.</p>

<p>There are a number of solid reasons for calling the test function a number of times between the single call to start timer and stop timer. This is why python has the <code>timeit</code> module.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Approach #1 -- checking all row-pairs</strong></p>

<p>As you suggested, you can iterate over all row pairs, and compute the inner product. If <code>A.shape==(N,M)</code>, i.e. you have N rows of size M each, you end up with a O(M*N^2) complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Approach #2 -- matrix multiplication</strong></p>

<p>As suggested in the comments by @JoeKington, you can compute the multiplication <code>A.dot(A.T)</code>, and check all the non-diagonal elements. Depending on the algorithm used for matrix multiplication, this can be <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Algorithms_for_efficient_matrix_multiplication"" rel=""nofollow"">faster</a> than the naive O(M*N^2) algorithm, but only asymptotically better. Unless your matrices are big, they would be slower.</p>

<hr>

<p>The advantages of approach #1:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can ""short circuit"" -- quit the check as soon as you find the first non-orthogonal pair</li>
<li>requires less memory. In #2, you create a temporary NxN matrix.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantages of approach #2:</p>

<ul>
<li>The multiplication is fast, as it is implemented in the heavily-optimized linear-algebra library (BLAS of ATLAS). I believe those libraries choose the right algorithm to use according to input size (i.e. they won't use the fancy algorithms on small matrices, because they are slower for small matrices. There's a big constant hidden behind that O-notation).</li>
<li>less code to write</li>
</ul>

<p>My bet is that for small matrices, approach #2 would prove faster due to the fact the LA libraries are heavily optimized, and despite the fact they compute the entire multiplication, even after processing the first pair of non-orthogonal rows.</p>

<p>In general, to find an orthogonal basis of the range space of some matrix X, one can compute the QR decomposition of this matrix (using Givens rotations or Householder reflectors). Q is an orthogonal matrix and R upper triangular. The columns of Q corresponding to non-zero diagonal entries of R form an orthonormal basis of the range space.</p>

<p>If the columns of X=A<sup>T</sup>, i.e., the rows of A, already are orthogonal, then the QR decomposition will necessarily have the R factor diagonal, where the diagonal entries are plus or minus the lengths of the columns of X resp. the rows of A.</p>

<p>Common folklore has it that this approach is numerically better behaved than the computation of the product A*A<sup>T</sup>=R<sup>T</sup>*R. This may only matter for larger matrices. The computation is not as straightforward as the matrix product, however, the amount of operations is of the same size.</p>

<pre><code>from collections import deque

def iterative_flatten(li):
    nested = deque(li)
    res = []
    dq = deque()
    while nested or dq:

</code></pre>

<p>Uses deques to avoid nasty O(n**2) behavior from <code>list.pop(0)</code>.  You can get equivalent results by making a reversed copy and popping from the end, but I find the code a little easier to follow if you just use deques and <code>popleft</code>.  On a similar note, it's a line or two less code if you want to mutate the list in-place but way slower (for the same reason; <code>pop</code>ping from the <em>head</em> of the list is O(n) since every element in the underlying array has to be shifted).</p>

<pre><code>nested = [1,[[2,3],[[4,5],[6]]],[[[[7]]]]]

iterative_flatten(nested)
Out[116]: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

sum(iterative_flatten(nested))
Out[117]: 28
</code></pre>

<p>The first line <code>XXXXXX</code> is six characters. The example with an input of <code>i=8</code> is eight characters. So why not output the the character <code>X</code> for <code>i</code> times?</p>

<p>That's your first line. Now continue with the rest of the lines.</p>

<p>The second line is <code>X    X</code>. There are four spaces for an input of <code>i=6</code>, six spaces for an input of <code>i=8</code>. So there's a pattern there, clearly. So why output an <code>X</code>, then <code>i-2</code> spaces, then another <code>X</code>?</p>

Think about what happens for other integer values that aren't <code>i=6</code>, <code>8</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>12</code>, etc. You can use <code>round</code>, <code>floor</code>, or a variation on these patterns in order to handle inputs such as <code>i=7</code> and <code>9</code>.</p>

<p>Based on my assumption, you first need to start a ServerThread listen to a port (it's not like what your 'ClientThread' did). Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>import socket
import threading

def main():
    host = 'localhost'
    port = 5000
    size = 1024

    thread1 = ServerThread(host, port, size) 
    thread1.start() 

    #open a socket for client
    try:
        clientSock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        clientSock.connect((host,port))
    except socket.error, (value,message):
        if clientSock:
            clientSock.close()
            print ""Could not connect to server: "" + message
        sys.exit(1) 

    while True:
        #wait for keyboard input
        line = raw_input()
        #send the input to the server unless its only a newline
        if line != ""\n"":
            clientSock.send(line)
            # Is server supposed to send back any response?
            #data = clientSock.recv(size)
            #print data
        if line == ""Quit"":
            clientSock.close()
            break

class ServerThread(threading.Thread): 
    def __init__(self, host, port, size): 
        super(ServerThread, self).__init__() 
        self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        self.sock.bind((host, port))
        self.sock.listen(1)
        self.data_size = size
        self.stopped = False 

    def run(self): 
        conn, addr = self.sock.accept()
        print 'Connected by', addr
        while not self.stopped: 
            data = conn.recv(self.data_size)
            if data == 'Quit':
                print 'Client close the connection'
                self.stopped = True
            else:
                print 'Server received data:', data
                # Is server supposed to send back any response?
                #conn.sendall('Server received data: ' + data)
        conn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</code></pre>

<p>And these are the output:</p>

<pre><code>Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 41153)

Server received data: def

Client close the connection

<p>The design is pretty simple. Read the file into a dictionary and perform manipulation on the dict, then write out the files.</p>

<pre><code>with open('file1.txt') as in_:
    mapping = {}
    for line in in_:
        key,value = line.strip().split(',')
        mapping[key] = int(value)
</code></pre>

<p><code>mapping</code> is now <code>{""a"":1, ""b"":3, ""c"":5, ""d"":-4}</code> Let's read in our files.</p>

<pre><code>values = {}
with open('file2.txt') as in_:
    for _ in range(3):
        # This is ugly, but it's a quick hack. I'd improve it later.
        cur_dict = next(in_).strip()
        values[cur_dict] = {}
        for __ in range(4):
            key, value = next(in_).strip().split(',')
            values[cur_dict][key] = int(value)
</code></pre>

<p>Sheesh that's probably the ugliest code I've ever written, but <code>values</code> is now <code>{""sample1"": {""a"":12, ""b"":10, ""c"":4, ""d"":6}, ""sample2"": ...}</code></p>

<p>Now for the manipulation. This is actually easy. Let's tack file write onto it, since this step is rather elementary</p>

    for key, value in mapping.items():

        for key,value in values[dataset]:

  <li>The author or authoring package needs to pre-compute the line breaks and use multiple ‘text’ elements (one for each line of text).</li>
  <li>The author or authoring package needs to pre-compute the line breaks and use a single ‘text’ element with one or more ‘tspan’ child
  elements with appropriate values for attributes ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘dx’ and
  ‘dy’ to set new start positions for those characters which start new
  lines. (This approach allows user text selection across multiple lines
  of text -- see Text selection and clipboard operations.)</li>
  <li>Express the text to be rendered in another XML namespace such as XHTML embedded inline within a ‘foreignObject’ element. (Note:

<p>I think that what is happening is that when you ""load"" the array, you're not actually loading an array. Instead, I think that an object is constructed on top of the file. It probably reads in dimensions and information related to how the file is organized, but it doesn't read the whole file.</p>

<p>That object mimicks an array so good that when you later on perform the slice operation, the normal Python slice operation can be executed, but at this point the actual data is being read. That's why the slice takes so long time compared to ""loading"" all the data.</p>

<p>I arrive at this conclusion because of the following.</p>

<p>If you're reading 75 frames of 3584x3584 pixels, I'm assuming they're uncompressed (H5 seems to be just raw dumps of data), and in that case, 75 * 3.584 * 3.584 = 963.379.200, this is around 918MB of data. Couple that with you ""reading"" this in 180ms, we get this calculation:</p>

<pre><code>918MB / 180ms = 5.1GB/second reading speed
</code></pre>

<p>Note, this number is for 1-byte pixels, which is also unlikely.</p>

<p>This speed thus seems highly unlikely, as even the best SSDs today reach way below 1GB/sec.</p>

<p>It seems much more plausible that an object is just constructed on top of the file and the slice operation incurs the cost of reading at least 1 frame worth of data.</p>

<p>If we divide the speed by 75 to get per-frame speed, we get 68MB/sec speed for 1-byte pixels, and with 24 or 32-bit pixels we get up to 270MB/sec reading speeds. Much more plausible.</p>

<p>If you want to  make a dict of the data, change <code>yield combo</code> to <code>yield tuple(combo)</code></p>

<p>Then you can store key value pairings  like:</p>

<pre><code>d={}
for data in power_set(l):
    d[data]=""your_calc_prob""
print d
{(0, 1): 'your_calc_prob', (1, 0): 'your_calc_prob', (0, 0): 'your_calc_prob', (1, 1): 'your_calc_prob'}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want the output sorted you can use sorted() which makes a copy of the list and returns a list:</p>

<pre><code> sorted(list(power_set(l)))
 Out[21]: 
 [[0, 0, 0],

 [0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 0],

<p>Or you can use the list method sort() which sorts the list  in place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When an identifier that textually occurs in a class definition begins
  with two or more underscore characters and does not end in two or more
  underscores, it is considered a private name of that class. Private
  names are transformed to a longer form before code is generated for
  them. The transformation inserts the class name, with leading
  underscores removed and a single underscore inserted, in front of the
  name. For example, the identifier __spam occurring in a class named
  Ham will be transformed to _Ham__spam.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I take object-based inputs and turn them into passable
  variables?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You access the controls and call the appropriate methods:</p>

<pre><code>self.resize_txt.GetValue()
self.file_input.GetPath()
self.outfile_input.GetPath()
</code></pre>

<p>To pass them to your resize, function, just pass those values to your resize_file function.</p>

<pre><code>resize_file(self.file_input.GetPath(),
            self.outfile_input.GetPath())
</code></pre>

<p>You're asking too many questions here TBH.  You should start with one, and create others as you progress.</p>

<p>What the heck, I have time to kill before lunch!  I'll give you a few pointers.</p>

<p>Let's look at this function:</p>

<pre><code>def resize_file(filename, filename2 = None)
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at this function, I really have no idea what the inputs are to the function.  It says filename and an optional filename2.  Which of these is being resized?  How do I know what each parameter does?  You did not document this function, which made me dig off into your code to try to determine what it does.</p>

<p>So, I dug off into your code...  And it appears that this particular function resizes and possibly appends pdfs.  Notice how in your code, you execute the same code twice?</p>

<pre><code>fIn1 = file(os.path.join(inputDir,filename), 'rb')

inp1 = PdfFileReader(fIn1)
p1 = inp1.getPage(0)
p1.scale(.5,.5)
output.addPage(p1)

if filename2 is not None:
    fIn2 = file(os.path.join(inputDir,filename2), 'rb')
    inp2 = PdfFileReader(fIn2)
    p2 = inp2.getPage(0)
    p2.scale(.50,.50)
    output.addPage(p2)
</code></pre>

<p>Don't do this.  Use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself"" rel=""nofollow"">DRY</a> principle.  You should have a loop, as the algorithm is basically the same.  (Can't illustrate the loop atm, running out of time before lunch, maybe when I get back :P)</p>

<p>You could even get fancy and have your function take an indefinite amount of PDF files.  Check this snippet out:</p>

<pre><code>def resize_file(*args):
    output = PdfFileWriter()

    for filename in args:
        fIn1 = file(os.path.join(inputDir, filename), 'rb')
        inp1 = PdfFileReader(fIn1)
        p1 = inp1.getPage(0)
        p1.scale(.5,.5)
        output.addPage(p1)

    outputStream = file(os.path.join(validateDir,str(fileout) + '.pdf'),""wb"")
    output.write(outputStream)
    outputStream.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, I lied, I tried to squeeze this in before lunch.  The code above may not work out of the box, but it should point you in the general direction.  You should add error catching to check for when no arguments are passed (among other things).</p>

<p>Hope it helps!</p>

If you do have a RAID system it might makes sense to have multiple threads reading from the disk, but you could do that with python standard threads.

The basic idea is to create a list to contain the lines of each text file, and then output the list to your new csv file. You save a 'delimiter' variable and then change it by checking each line as you go through the text files.</p>

<p>For example:
I created two text files on my Desktop. They read as follows:</p>

<p>delimiter_test_1.txt</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>test=delimiter=here </p>
  
  <p>does-it-work</p>
  
  <p>I'm:Not:Sure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>delimiter_test_2.txt</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This:File:Uses:Colons</p>
  
  <p>Pretty:Much:The:Whole:Time</p>
  
  <p>does-it-work</p>
  
  <p>If-Written-Correctly-yes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then ran this script on them:</p>

<pre><code>import csv
import glob
import os

directory = raw_input(""INPUT Folder for Log Dump Files:"")
output = raw_input(""OUTPUT Folder for .csv files:"")

txt_files = os.path.join(directory, '*.txt')

delimiter = ':'
for txt_file in glob.glob(txt_files):
    SavingList = []

    with open(txt_file, 'r') as text:
            for line in text:
                if line == 'test=delimiter=here\n':
                    delimiter = '='
                elif line == 'does-it-work\n':
                    delimiter = '-'
                elif line == ""I'm:Not:Sure"":
                    delimiter = ':'

                SavingList.append(line.split(delimiter))

    with open('%s.csv' %os.path.join(output, txt_file.split('.')[0]), 'wb') as output_file:
            writer = csv.writer(output_file)
            for m in xrange(len(SavingList)):
                writer.writerow(SavingList[m])
</code></pre>

<p>And got two csv files with the text split based on the desired delimiter. Depending on how many different lines you have for changing the delimiter you could set up a dictionary of said lines. Then your check becomes:</p>

<pre><code>if line in my_dictionary.keys():
    delimiter = my_dictionary[line]
</code></pre>

<p>for example.</p>

That's a typo in the docs <a href=""http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Divide-and-Conquer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">that is still there</a>.</p>

<p>That said, for the load balancing pattern you need to add a <strong>broker</strong> in the middle of your architecture. As pointed out by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/545332/jason"">Jason</a> in the comments, this is well explained in <a href=""http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#A-Load-Balancing-Message-Broker"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the official guide</a>. There are also examples in Python.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CVFTy.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CVFTy.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The main idea is to have the workers sending a small ""READY"" message to the broker whenever they are free to receive more jobs. The broker in turns, keep ""pointers"" to free workers in a queue. When he receives a new job request from a client he also propagates the request to the first free worker in the queue, which gets popped out from the queue. As you can see in the picture above, the broker exploits ROUTER sockets in order to avoid a blocking behavior and to get proper load balancing. A small additional detail is that the broker does not poll the clients if there are not free workers in the queue.</p>

<p>This is the simplest way I am aware of for implementing a load balancing pattern with ZeroMQ. It is not exactly like ""polling"" for new jobs in the queue, but I think this is what you need. Also please beware that this is <strong>really</strong> the simplest way, that is, it is not reliable at all and it does not scale well as is. If you also need reliability, I suggest you to thoroughly read <a href=""http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Chapter-Reliable-Request-Reply-Patterns"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Chapter 4 of the official guide</a>.</p>

<p>As a side note, maybe you should seriously consider Celery for this task. I am really in love with ZeroMQ, however this is exactly the kind of thing that Celery is very good at, and in my opinion it is not so difficult to learn, as <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7909201"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">someone may think</a>.</p>

Once you do that you can use whatever plotting you like best (here I've used matplotlib's mplot3d, but it has some quirks).</p>

<p>What follows takes your data and reshapes it appropriately so you can then plot a surface that I believe is what your are looking for.  The key is using the <code>pivot</code> method, which restructures your data by date and time.</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d

fname = 'total_watt.csv'

# Read in the data, but I skipped setting the index and made sure no data
# is lost to a nonexistent header
df = pd.read_csv(fname, parse_dates=[0], header=None, names=['datetime', 'watt'])

# We want to separate the date from the time, so create two new columns
df['date'] = [x.date() for x in df['datetime']]
df['time'] = [x.time() for x in df['datetime']]

# Now we want to reshape the data so we have dates and times making the result 2D
pv = df.pivot(index='time', columns='date', values='watt')

# Not every date has every time, so fill in the subsequent NaNs or there will be holes
# in the surface
pv = pv.fillna(0.0)

# Now, we need to construct some arrays that matplotlib will like for X and Y values
xx, yy = np.mgrid[0:len(pv),0:len(pv.columns)]

# We can now plot the values directly in matplotlib using mplot3d
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

ax.plot_surface(xx, yy, pv.values, cmap='jet', rstride=1, cstride=1)
ax.grid(False)

# Now we have to adjust the ticks and ticklabels - so turn the values into strings
dates = [x.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for x in pv.columns]
times = [str(x) for x in pv.index]

# Setting a tick every fifth element seemed about right
ax.set_xticks(xx[::5,0])
ax.set_xticklabels(times[::5])
ax.set_yticks(yy[0,::5])
ax.set_yticklabels(dates[::5])

plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me (using your data) the following graph:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/UDbyo.png"" alt=""3D surface plot of clustered data""></p>

<p>Note that I've assumed when plotting and making the ticks that your dates and times are linear (which they are in this case).  If you have data with uneven samples, you'll have to do some interpolation before plotting.</p>

<p>The problem comes in when the 'request' object's url is used by webapp2:</p>

<pre><code>if uri.startswith(('.', '/')):
    request = request or get_request()
    uri = str(urlparse.urljoin(request.url, uri))

<p>In this case you are overriding the RequestHandler's 'self.request' attribute with your own (to call GitHub):</p>

<pre><code>self.request = urllib2.Request(GITHUB_URL_ACCESSTOKEN, self.data)

<p>I surmise that there is no 'url' on this new request object.</p>

<p>=======================</p>

<p>[Old answer]</p>

<p>Going out on a limb here based on the given info, but is your handler class extending webapp2.RequestHandler? If not the url attribute may not exist in 'self'.</p>

"31256671","2","","31256397","2015-07-06 22:21:29","","2","","<p>Keep a boolean hashtable of hash codes of lines already seen.</p>

<p>For each line:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if line hash()es to something you have already seen, you have a potential match: scan the file to check if it really is a duplicate.</p></li>
<li><p>if line hash()es to a new hash, just mark the hash for the first time.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Dedicate as much memory you can to this hashtable, and the false positive rate will be low (i.e. less times you will have to scan for duplicates and found none).</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>table_size = 2**16
seen = [False]*table_size
for line in file:
    h = hash(line) % table_size
    if seen[h]:
        dup = False
        with open('yourfile','r') as f:
            for line1 in f:
                if line == line1:
                    dup = True
                    break
            if not dup:
                print(line)
    else:
        seen[h] = True
        print(line)
</code></pre>

<p>As it has been pointed out, since you cannot store all the lines in memory you don't have many options, but at least this option doesn't require to scan the file for every single line, because most of the entries in the table will be False, i.e. the algorithm is sub-quadratic if the tabe is not full; it will degenerate to O(n<sup>2</sup>) once the table is full.</p>

<p>You can make a very memory-efficient implementation of the hash table, that requires only 1 bit for each hash code (e.g. make it an array of bytes, where each byte can store 8 boolean values)</p>

Use unix 'sort' to sort that new file, excluding the line number field. The sort utility will merge sort the file even if it exceeds the size of available memory. Now you have a new file in which the duplicates are ordered, along with their original line numbers. Extract the line numbers of the duplicates and then use that as input for linearly processing your original data. </p>

<p>In more detailed steps. </p>

<ul>
<li>Make a new version of your file such that each line is prepended by its line number. So, ""someline"" becomes ""1, someline"" </li>
<li>sort this file using the unix sort utility  - sort -t"","" -k2,2 file</li>
<li>Scan the new file for consecutive duplicate entries in the second field</li>
<li>the line numbers (first field) of such entries are the line numbers of duplicate lines in your original file - extract these and use them as input to remove duplicates in the original data. Since you know exactly where they are, you need not read in the entire file or create a giant in-memory structure for duplicates</li>
</ul>

<p>The advantage of this method compared to some of the others suggested - it always works, regardless of the size of the input and the size of your available memory and it does not fail due to hash collisions or other probabilistic artifacts. You are leveraging the merge sort in unix sort where the hard stuff - dealing with larger-than-memory input - 
 has been done for you. </p>

<p>So since Python parses the file first, literals can be loaded effectively into the memory. Since Python knows that these are constant, all variables that represent those constant values can point to the same object in memory. So the object is shared.</p>

<p>This works for ints and floats, but even for strings; even when there is a constant expression that needs to be evaluated first:</p>

<pre><code>a = ""foo""
b = ""foo""
c = ""fo"" + ""o""
print(a is b)
print(a is c)
</code></pre>

<p>Now in IDLE, the behavior is very different: As an interactive interpreter, IDLE executes every line separately. So <code>a = 1.1</code> and <code>b = 1.1</code> are executed in separated contexts which makes it impossible (or just very hard) to figure out that they both share the same constant literal value and could share the memory. So instead, the interpreter will allocate two different objects, which causes the identity check using <code>is</code> to fail.</p>

<p>For small integers, the situation is a bit different. Because they are often used, CPython stores a set of integers (in the range between -5 and 256) statically and makes that every value of these points to the same <code>int</code> object. That’s why you get a different result for small integers than for any other object. See also the following questions:</p>

<p>The defect of <code>cx_freeze</code> is it would not wrap all libraries to target dir, this means you have to test your build under different environments.

<p>Paraphrasing slighly, the text <em>says</em> this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This module implements an <strong>algorithm</strong> for turning an object into a series of bytes. <strong>This process</strong> is also called <em>serializing</em> the object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I removed the module name, <code>pickle</code>, deliberately. The module implements a process, an algorithm, and that process is commonly known as <em>serialisation</em>.</p>

<p>There are other implementations of that process. You could use JSON or XML to serialise data to text. There is also the <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/marshal.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>marshal</code> module</a>. Other languages have other serialization formats; the <a href=""https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/serialize.html"" rel=""nofollow"">R language has one</a>, so <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html"" rel=""nofollow"">does Java</a>. Etc.</p>

<p>See the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization"" rel=""nofollow"">WikiPedia article on the subject</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, in the context of data storage, <strong>serialization</strong> is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Python picked the name <code>pickle</code> because it modelled the process on how this was handled in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-3"" rel=""nofollow"">Modula-3</a>, where it was also called pickling.

<p>No, netTcpBinding is interoperable only with WCF clients. </p>

<p>From <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.nettcpbinding(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default configuration for the NetTcpBinding is faster than the
  configuration provided by the WSHttpBinding, <strong>but it is intended only
  for WCF-to-WCF communication</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>does wsHttpBinding work or only basicHttpBinding work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Short answer is no, basicHttpBinding is the only binding (except for the web bindings) which support interoperability with non-wcf clients. Even then you may have difficulty consuming it from non-windows.</p>

<p>Long answer is that the reason this is the case is because basicHttpBinding supports communication over SOAP 1.1, which is a relatively simple protocol, and most vendors have implemented it in very similar ways. Therefore, these different implementations tend to be interoperable. However, wsHttpBinding is Microsoft's attempt to support the SOAP 1.2 protocol and WS-* web service extensions, which is a much larger and more complex set of standards. So there is a much larger scope for interpretation between the various vendors, leading normally to non-interoperability between implementations. It is theoretically possible, therefore, to call an endpoint exposed over wsHttpBinding from a non-wcf (or even non-windows) client, but you would have to overcome all the niggles.</p>

<p>A much better approach would be to move away from SOAP completely if possible, and just use HTTP/POX or HTTP/REST services. </p>

<pre><code>Copy schema1.table1 from local 'E:\folder1\table1.csv.gz' STREAM NAME 'E:\folder1\table1.csv.gz' GZIP with Delimiter ',' direct;
</code></pre>

<p>Then run a query on the stream loads that were successful and remove them from your list. </p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM v_monitor.load_streams WHERE stream_name = 'My stream name';
</code></pre>

<p>Also it's good to see the <code>rejected_row_count</code> column value in the <code>load_streams</code> table as it will tell you how many rows were rejected.</p>

<p>You can use <code>CURRENT_LOAD_SOURCE()</code> as well, with this you will need to add a new column to your table.</p>

<p>But this is used when I do loads from different locations(parallel), and I can identify better which file failed during load.</p>

<pre><code>--create the table 
create table bla(email varchar2(50),source varchar2(200));

--load the table using the CURRENT_LOAD_SOURCE() as a filler for the source column
COPY bla (email, source AS CURRENT_LOAD_SOURCE()) FROM '/home/dbadmin/data*' DELIMITER ',';

select * from bla limit 1;

                        email                     |  source

<p>The openpyxl documentation is pretty clear about the different options used when opening workbooks: data_only only read the results of any formulae and ignore the formulae.</p>

<p>If you only want to copy the values from one workbook to another then you can combine read-only and write-only modes to reduce the memory footprint. The following pseudo-code should give you a basis.</p>

As there is 2 version version of python installed (on that haven't got the library installed ), it is recommended to specify the path to the desired interpreter. The first solution help correct the issue.

Using a task queue. Whatever said and done it's not safe to execute commands from your web facing PHP scripts. If you are already using RabbitMQ or something similar you can use that here.

If you instead maintain a list of scores in memory, and update it at a more reasonable frequency (say once an hour, or even once a minute, if your players are really concerned with their rank), then the players will still experience real-time progress vs a score rank, and they can't really tell if there is a short lag in the updates.</p>

<p>With a sorted list of scores in memory, you can instantly get the player's rank (where by instantly, I mean O(lg n) lookup in memory) at the cost of the memory to cache, and of course the time to update the cache when you want to. Compared to a db query of 100k records every time someone wants to glance at their rank, this is a much better option.</p>

<p>Elaborating on the sorted list, you must query the db to get it, but you can keep using it for a while. Maybe you store the last_update, and re-query the db only if this list is ""too old"". So you update quickly by not trying to update all the time, but rather just enough to feel like real-time.</p>

<p>In order to find someone's rank nearly instantaneously, you use the bisect module, which supports binary search in a sorted list. The scores are sorted when you get them.</p>

<pre><code>from bisect import bisect_left

# suppose scores are 1 through 10
scores = range(1, 11)

# get the insertion index for score 7
# subtract it from len(scores) because bisect expects ascending sort
# but you want a descending rank
print len(scores) - bisect_left(scores, 7)
</code></pre>

<p>This says that a 7 score is rank 4, which is correct.</p>

<p>You'll notice that for a tuple <code>(a,b,c,d)</code>, <code>(c,d,a,b)</code> also appears.  If a number <code>a == 9*b</code>, then <code>b != a*9</code>.  We'll use this to our advantage.</p>

<p>Also, note that if <code>a = 9*b</code>, <code>a</code> must be bigger than <code>b</code>, unless we're using negative numbers or non-integers.</p>

<p>You'll see that as we look at the results, splitting the tuples in half and turning them into numbers gives, initially, a small number followed by a larger number.  This is a side effect of passing <code>permutations</code> a sorted list.  Again, we can use this to our advantage.</p>

<pre><code>import itertools

def makenum(digits):
    return int(''.join(map(str, digits)))

for p in itertools.permutations(range(10)):
    first_half = makenum(p[:5])    
    second_half = makenum(p[5:])
    if second_half &lt; first_half: # first half is smaller for first half of permutations, second half of permutations has been covered, backwards.
        break
    if second_half == 9 * first_half:
        print(first_half, second_half)
</code></pre>

<p>If you're taking user input, you should be able to get the same result simply by <code>sort</code>ing your input:</p>

<pre><code>for p in itertools.permutations(sorted(digits)):
    # ...

"38961389","2","","38961284","2016-08-15 19:06:42","","2","","<p>I think there are two parts to your issue. The first is ""what's wrong with <code>pcl</code> in the current code?"", and the second is ""why do I need the <code>if __name__ == ""__main__""</code> guard block at all?"".</p>

<p>Lets address them in order. The problem with the <code>pcl</code> variable is that it is only defined in the <code>if</code> block, so if the module gets loaded without being run as a script (which is what sets <code>__name__ == ""__main__""</code>), it will not be defined when the later code runs.</p>

<p>To fix this, you can change how your code is structured. The simplest fix would be to guard the other bits of the code that use <code>pcl</code> within an <code>if __name__ == ""__main__""</code> block too (e.g. indent them all under the current block, perhaps). An alternative fix would be to put the code that uses <code>pcl</code> into functions (which can be declared outside the guard block), then call the functions from within an <code>if __name__ == ""__main__""</code> block. That would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def do_stuff_with_pcl(pcl):
    print(pcl)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    # multiprocessing code, etc
    pcl = ...
    do_stuff_with_pcl(pcl)
</code></pre>

<p>As for why the issue came up in the first place, the ultimate cause is using the <code>multiprocessing</code> module on Windows. You can read about the issue in <a href=""https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#windows"" rel=""nofollow"">the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>When multiprocessing creates a new process for its <code>Pool</code>, it needs to initialize that process with a copy of the current module's state. Because Windows doesn't have <code>fork</code> (which copies the parent process's memory into a child process automatically), Python needs to set everything up from scratch. In each child process, it loads the module from its file, and if you the module's top-level code tries to create a new <code>Pool</code>, you'd have a recursive situation where each of the child process would start spawning a whole new set of child processes of its own.</p>

<p>The <code>multiprocessing</code> code has some guards against that, I think (so you won't <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb"" rel=""nofollow"">fork bomb</a> yourself out of simple carelessness), but you still need to do some of the work yourself too, by using <code>if __name__ == ""__main__""</code> to guard any code that shouldn't be run in the child processes.</p>

<p>As you can see, it throws your IP (in my case, <code>122.126.64.43</code>) in the HTTP header: <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> and hence the website knows that the request was sent on behalf of <code>122.126.64.43</code></p>

<pre><code>from time import mktime
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil import tz

dt_base = datetime(2012, 11, 9, 9, 4, 2)

<p>These calls happen ""more or less"" in parallel: which actually means in random sequence.</p>

<p>However the list <code>change_objects</code> is shared, so the first web-client that spots a change will update the ""old"" copy in the shared <code>WalkReporter</code> instance to the latest state, and may do so before the other clients spot the change. i.e. the first successful web-client effectively hides the change from the other web-clients.</p>

<p>This is easily fixed, by giving each web-client its own copy of <code>change_objects</code>. </p>

<p>Note:
The way you are using the api, by simple http request, altough works, is the not the ideal way to use their API.
There is a python package called Quandl, you can install like so:</p>

<pre><code>pip3 install quandl
</code></pre>

<p>On your system.
Also then you would have a single (and not multiple using auth_token=YOUR_TOKEN in each request) auth call like so:</p>

<pre><code>quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = 'YOUR_TOEKN'
</code></pre>

<p>And then each api call will be simple and elegent using their package instead or creating an http request manually, like so:</p>

<pre><code>data = quandl.get(""CME/ESH2010.csv"", order=""asc"")

<blockquote>
  <p>While a RawQuerySet instance can be iterated over like a normal
  QuerySet, RawQuerySet doesn’t implement all methods you can use with
  QuerySet. For example, <strong>bool</strong>() and <strong>len</strong>() are not defined in
  RawQuerySet, and thus all RawQuerySet instances are considered True.
  The reason these methods are not implemented in RawQuerySet is that
  implementing them without internal caching would be a performance
  drawback and adding such caching would be backward incompatible.</p>

<p>Consider this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh oak 'ftp &lt;&lt; EOF
lpwd
quit
EOF'
Local directory: /home/jklowden
$ 
</code></pre>

<p>What is happening?  The entire quoted string is passed as a single argument to ssh, where it is ""executed"" on the remote.  While ssh isn't explicit about what that means, exactly, we know what <strong>execv</strong>(2) does: if <strong>execve</strong>(2) fails to execute its passed arguments, the execv function will invoke <code>/bin/sh</code> with the same arguments (in this case, our quoted string).  The shell then evaluates the quoted string as separate arguments, detects the HereDoc redirection, and executes per usual.  </p>

<p>Using that information, and taking a quick look at the <a href=""https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pxssh.html"" rel=""nofollow"">pexpect.pxssh</a> documentation, it looks like you want:</p>

<pre><code>s = pxssh.pxssh()
...
s.sendline('ftp &lt;&lt; EOF\nlpwd\nquit\nEOF')
</code></pre>

<p>If that doesn't work, something is munging your data.  Five minutes with <strong>strace</strong>(1) will tell you what happened to it, and you can start pointing fingers.  ;-)</p>

<p>HTH.  </p>

I ran into this exact problem today with pysftp, which is built on paramiko. <code>libffi-72499c49.so.6.0.4</code> is in a hidden dot directory inside <code>lib64/python2.7/site-packages/.libs_cffi_backend</code>. Depending on how you zipped up the dependencies in your virtualenv, you may have inadvertantly excluded this directory.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, make sure libffi-devel and openssl-devel are installed on your <a href=""http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Amazon Linux instance</a>, otherwise the cryptography module may not be compiling correctly.</p>

<pre><code>sudo yum install libffi-devel openssl-devel
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>If those packages were not installed before, delete and rebuild your virtualenv.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>Make sure that when you are zipping up your site-packages that you use '.' instead of '*', otherwise you will not be including files and directories that are hidden because their names begin with a period.</p>

They are based on dumps of original lambda filesystem. Also they have build-specific variants (tags <code>build-python2.7</code> and <code>build-python3.6</code> are most interesting for us).
These images are not very small - more than 500mb - but they allow you to avoid any headache when building.</p>

<p>Important benefit over Amazon Linux is that all package versions etc are the same as on the real lambda.</p>

<p>Here is how I did building myself:</p>

<pre><code>cd PROJECT_DIR
docker run --rm -it -v ""$PWD"":/var/task lambci/lambda:build-python2.7 bash
### now in docker
mkdir deps
pip install -t deps -r requirements.txt
# now all dependencies for our package are installed to deps/ directory,
# without any garbage like wheel or setuptools - unlike when using virtualenv
zip -r archive.zip MYCODE.py MYMODULE MYMODULE2.py
cd deps
# it's important to use . here, not * - or else some dot-starting directories will be omitted
zip -r ../archive.zip .
exit
### now locally
# just upload archive to lambda, with or without s3
</code></pre>

<p>For automating it with GitLab CI, just instruct it to use that same docker image
and put these commands in deploy script section:</p>

<pre><code>deploy:
    stage: deploy
    image: lambci/lambda:build-python2.7
    script:
        - mkdir deps
        - pip install -t deps -r requirements.txt
        - zip -r archive.zip MYCODE.py MYMODULE MYMODULE2.py
        - cd deps &amp;&amp; zip -r ../archive.zip . &amp;&amp; cd ..
        - aws s3 cp archive.zip ${bucket}/${key}
        - aws lambda update-function-code --function-name ${func} --s3-bucket ${bucket} --s3-key ${key}
    variables:
        bucket: ...
        key: ...

<p>Just try to concatenate your queryset using <code>|</code> </p>

<p>In your example</p>

<pre><code>final_q = summary | awards_used

<p>UPDATED:</p>

<p>| does not works using calculated attributes, so, we can select our queryset first and then mapping our extra attributes </p>

<pre><code>summary = Award.objects.filter(awardreceived__date__lte=query_date) 
awards_used = Award.objects.filter(awardused__date__lte=query_date)
final_q = summary | awards_used

final_q = final_q.annotate(used=Sum('awardused__date__lte__units')).annotate(awarded=Sum('awardissuedactivity__units_awarded'))

<p><strong>SOLUTION 2</strong>  </p>

<p>Using chain built-in function </p>

<pre><code>from itertools import chain
final_list = list(chain(summary, awards_used))

  <p>Does anyone know the historic reasons for the default behaviour?</p>

<p>Guido van Rossum commented that he liked <em>update()</em> better and thinks a <code>+</code> operator wouldn't read clearly in code.</p>

<p>FWIW, he did approve <a href=""https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PEP 448</a> which gives your another way to do it using star-unpacking generalizations:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = {'c': 3, 'b': 4}
&gt;&gt;&gt; {**a, **b}
{'a': 1, 'b': 4, 'c': 3}
</code></pre>

<p>There are several reasons why <code>+</code> might not be a good idea.  Usually, we expect addition to be commutative, but dict addition would fail whenever there were overlapping keys with distinct values.   The ""normal"" use case is to update only dict in-place, but the usual semantics of <code>+</code> would copy the contents of both inputs to create a new dict (which is somewhat wasteful).</p>

<p>In addition, Python has <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.ChainMap"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">collections.ChainMap</a> which replaces the expense of copying with a new expense of potentially having multiple lookups.</p>

<p>So you can first find all the delimiters and preserve them in a proper container with their frequency, then find the most common and first one, then split your string based on them.</p>

<p>Now for finding the delimiters, you need to separate them from the plain text based on a particular feature, for example if they are none word characters, and for preserving them we can use a dictionary in order to preserve the count of similar delimiters (in this case <code>collections.Counter()</code> will do the job).</p>

It is available in the <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein/"" rel=""nofollow"">python-Levenshtein package</a>.  Another popular distance is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance"" rel=""nofollow"">Jaro Winkler's distance</a>, also available in the same package.</p>

<p>Assuming a simple array <code>numpy</code> array:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np
import Levenshtein as lv

ar = np.array([
      'string'
    , 'stum'
    , 'Such'
    , 'Say'
    , 'nay'
    , 'powder'
    , 'hiden'
    , 'parrot'
    , 'ming'
    ])
</code></pre>

<p>We define helpers to give us indexes of Levenshtein and Jaro distances, between a string we have and all strings in the array.</p>

<pre><code>def levenshtein(dist, string):
    return map(lambda x: x&lt;dist, map(lambda x: lv.distance(string, x), ar))

def jaro(dist, string):
    return map(lambda x: x&lt;dist, map(lambda x: lv.jaro_winkler(string, x), ar))
</code></pre>

<p>Now, note that Levenshtein distance is an integer value counted in number of characters, whilst Jaro's distance is a floating point value that normally varies between 0 and 1.  Let's test this using <code>np.where</code>:</p>

<pre><code>print ar[np.where(levenshtein(3, 'str'))]
print ar[np.where(levenshtein(5, 'str'))]
print ar[np.where(jaro(0.00000001, 'str'))]
print ar[np.where(jaro(0.9, 'str'))]
</code></pre>

<p>And we get:</p>

<pre><code>['stum']
['string' 'stum' 'Such' 'Say' 'nay' 'ming']
['Such' 'Say' 'nay' 'powder' 'hiden' 'ming']
['string' 'stum' 'Such' 'Say' 'nay' 'powder' 'hiden' 'parrot' 'ming']

I would like to know more about that.  But let us start simple and make the minimum changes to pyshell.main needed to make it run with other code.  </p>

<p>Note that in 3.6, which I use below, <code>PyShell.py</code> is renamed <code>pyshell.py</code>. Also note that everything here amounts to using IDLE's private internals and is 'use at your own risk'.</p>

<p>I presume you want to run Shell in the same process (and thread) as your tkinter code.  Change the signature to</p>

<pre><code>def main(tkroot=None):
</code></pre>

<p>Change root creation (find <code># setup root</code>) to</p>

<pre><code>if not tkroot:
    root = Tk(className=""Idle"")
    root.withdraw()
else:
    root = tkroot
</code></pre>

<p>In current 3.6, there are a couple more lines to be indented under <code>if not tkroot</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    if use_subprocess and not testing:
        NoDefaultRoot()
</code></pre>

<p>Guard mainloop and destroy (at the end) with</p>

<pre><code>if not tkroot:
    while flist.inversedict:  # keep IDLE running while files are open.
        root.mainloop()
    root.destroy()
# else leave mainloop and destroy to caller of main
</code></pre>

<p>The above adds 'dependency injection' of a root window to the function.  I might add it in 3.6 to make testing (an example of 'other code') easier.</p>

<p>The follow tkinter program now runs, displaying the both the root window and an IDLE shell.</p>

<pre><code>from tkinter import *
from idlelib import pyshell

root = Tk()
Label(root, text='Root id is '+str(id(root))).pack()
root.update()
def later():
    pyshell.main(tkroot=root)
    Label(root, text='Use_subprocess = '+str(pyshell.use_subprocess)).pack()

Here are the steps I took, in order to achieve a MVC architecture from Bryan Oakleys example (link is in the question), which refreshes its model class via the controller class, whenever a user takes an action in the view (GUI). </p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Add a model class</strong></p>

<p>First, in order to use a MVC architecture, we have to seperate the code into model, view and control. In this example, model is <code>class Model:</code>, control is <code>class PageControl(tk.Tk):</code> and view are the pages <code>class StartPage(tk.Frame)</code>, <code>PageOne(tk.Frame)</code> and <code>PageTwo(tk.Frame)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Set up your model class</strong></p>

<p>Now we have to decide on which variables we want to have in the model class. In this example, we have directories and keys (status of the comboboxes), which we want to save in dictionaries. After setting them up empty, all we have to do is add setters and getters for each variable, so we can refresh data in model and also retrieve some, if we want. Additionally, we could implement delet methods for each variable, if we wanted to.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Add push and pull methods to the control class</strong></p>

<p>Now that there is a model class, we can refrence it via e. g. <code>self.model = Model()</code> in <code>PageControl(tk.Tk)</code> (control). Now we have the basic tools to set data in <code>Model</code> via e. g. <code>self.model.set_keys(self.shared_keys)</code> and also get data from <code>Model</code>. Since we want our control class to do that, we need some methods, that can achieve this. So we add the push and pull methods to the <code>PageControl</code> (e. g. <code>def push_key(self)</code>), which in turn can be refrenced from view (StartPage, PageOne, PageTwo) via controller.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Add your widgets to the view class</strong></p>

<p>Now we have to decide on which widgets shall be on which page and what you want them to do. In this example, there are buttons for navigation, which for the sake of the task can be ignored, two comboboxes and a button, which opens a file dialog. </p>

<p>Here, we want the comboboxes to refresh their status whenever it is changed and send the new status via controller to the model. Whereas the <code>Open</code> button of <code>PageOne</code> shall open a file dialog, where the user then selects files he/she wants to open. The directories we got from this interaction then shall be send via controller to model.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Get all your functionality into the controller class</strong></p>

<p>Since there is a controller variable, we can use it to refrence methods, which are in the controller class. This way, we can outsource all our methods from the pages into the controller and reference them via self.controller.function_of_controller_class. But we have to be aware, that methods, which are bound to commands via <code>lambda:</code> can't return any values, but they are also not called on programme startup. So keep that in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Set up your bindings and wrappers</strong></p>

<p>Here we have to set up the <code>.bind()</code> for our comboboxes. Since the controller allready is set up to store data and the comboboxes have a textvariable, we can use this to gather information about the status of the comboboxes via <code>combobox.bind(&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelect&gt;&gt;)</code>. All we have to do is to set up a wrapper which is called, whenever <code>combobox.bind(&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelect&gt;&gt;)</code> is throwing an event.</p>

<p><strong>Closing statement</strong></p>

<p>Now we have it, a programme based on Bryan Oakleys example of ""How to get variable data from a class"", which utilises a model, which is updated via controller whenever the user takes a corresponding action in the view. Unfortunately it doesn't utilise a Observer class, as first intended, but I'll keep working on it and update this, when I've found a satisfying solution.</p>

<p><strong>Caveats</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I use <code>&lt;=</code>, not <code>&lt;</code> as indicated in your question, because that's what numpy supports.</li>
<li>This minimizes the total sum of all values in the target vector.
For your use case, you probably want to minimize the distance
to the original sample, which the linear program cannot handle, since neither the squared error nor the absolute difference can be expressed using a linear combination (which is what c stands for). For that, you will probably need to go to full <a href=""https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize"" rel=""nofollow""><code>minimize()</code></a>. </li>
</ul>

            clients.remove(client)
            client.close()
</code></pre>

<p>When you send a string over TCP you need to encode it to bytes. So your client file should look like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>def run(self):
    self._client.send(('Welcome to the chatroom!').encode())
    self._name = self._client.recv(BUFSIZE).decode()
    self._client.send(str(self._record),CODE)
    while True:
        message = self._client.recv(BUFSIZE).decode()
        if not message:
            print('Client disconnected')
            self._client.close()
            break
        else:
            message=self._name +'' + \
                    ctime()+'\n'+message
            self._record.add(message)
            self._client.send(self._record.encode())
</code></pre>

<pre><code>import flask

<p>then set up your <code>@app.route()</code>s, and then when you want to start the app:</p>

<pre><code>import gevent

app_server = gevent.wsgi.WSGIServer((host, port), app)
app_server.serve_forever()

<p>I had a case where I wanted the utility of flask to build a web application (a REST API service) and found the inability to compose flask with other non-flask, non-web-service elements a problem. I eventually found <code>gevent.wsgi.WSGIServer</code> and it was just what I needed. After the call to <code>app_server.serve_forever()</code>, you can call <code>app_server.stop()</code> when your application wants to exit.</p>

In your screenshot it looks like a small indent size so this seems like the likely culprit. Try highlighting the full block of indented code and hitting <code>ctrl+[</code> then <code>ctrl+]</code> (this unindents the selected lines of code, then reindents them using the jupyter indent size). </p>

<p>If this doesn't work, you might try checking to see if there are any custom indentation settings specified in either "".jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.json"" or "".jupyter/custom/custom.js"" (... or whatever the Windows equivalents are).</p>

<p>In "".jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.json"", I have the indentUnit set to 4 spaces (and have also enabled linewrapping).</p>

<pre><code>{
  ""CodeCell"": {
    ""cm_config"": {
      ""indentUnit"": 4,
      ""lineWrapping"":true
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Most editors allow you to set your indent size (Atom, sublime text, etc.) so you can avoid this issue in the future by making sure you have the same indent size everywhere you're swapping code to/from (assuming this is what's causing the red highlighting). Python's default is 4 so def recommend sticking with that. </p>

<p>The tricky-looking part here is the ternary statement <code>$1==last?"" "":""\n""</code>.  This just tests to see if the first field is equal to the last first field.  If it is, it returns the string after the <code>?</code>.  If it isn't, it returns the string after the <code>:</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>last=$1</code></p>

In [2]: en_doc = en_nlp(u'Hello, world. Here are two sentences.')

<p>Sentences can be obtained by using <code>doc.sents</code>:</p>

<pre><code>In [4]: list(en_doc.sents)
Out[4]: [Hello, world., Here are two sentences.]
</code></pre>

<p>Noun chunks are given by <code>doc.noun_chunks</code>:</p>

<pre><code>In [6]: list(en_doc.noun_chunks)

<p><a href=""https://spacy.io/docs/#examples-entities"" rel=""noreferrer"">Named entity</a> is given by <code>doc.ents</code>:</p>

<pre><code>In [11]: [(ent, ent.label_) for ent in en_doc.ents]
Out[11]: [(two, u'CARDINAL')]
</code></pre>

<p>Tokenization: You can iterate over the doc to get tokens. <code>token.orth_</code> gives str of the token.</p>

<pre><code>In [12]: [tok.orth_ for tok in en_doc]
Out[12]: [u'Hello', u',', u'world', u'.', u'Here', u'are', u'two', u'sentences', u'.']

<p>POS is given by <code>token.tag_</code>:</p>

<pre><code>In [13]: [tok.tag_ for tok in en_doc]
Out[13]: [u'UH', u',', u'NN', u'.', u'RB', u'VBP', u'CD', u'NNS', u'.']

<p>Lemmatization:</p>

<pre><code>In [15]: [tok.lemma_ for tok in en_doc]
Out[15]: [u'hello', u',', u'world', u'.', u'here', u'be', u'two', u'sentence', u'.']
</code></pre>

<p>Dependency parsing. You can traverse the parse tree by using <code>token.dep_</code> <code>token.rights</code> or <code>token.lefts</code>. You can write a function to print dependencies:</p>

<pre><code>In [19]: for token in en_doc:
    ...:     print(token.orth_, token.dep_, token.head.orth_, [t.orth_ for t in token.lefts], [t.orth_ for t in token.rights])

<p>Do <em>not</em> change the value of a loop parameter while you're inside the loop.  Specifically, don't change y within the <strong>for y</strong> loop.</p>

<p>Get rid of <strong>c</strong>; you can derive it from the other values.</p>

<p>For flexibility, make your upper limit a parameter: you have two constants (6 and 7) that depend on one concept (row limit).</p>

<p>Here's my version:</p>

<pre><code>row_limit = 7

for y in range(1, row_limit):
    print()
    print((row_limit-y-1) * "" "", end="""")

    for x in range(y, 2*y):
        print(x%10, end="""")

    for x in range(2*(y-1), y-1, -1):
        print(x%10, end="""")

print()
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>     1
    232
   34543
  4567654
 567898765
67890109876
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you really want to push things, you can shorten the loops with string concatenation and comprehension, but it's likely harder to read for you.</p>

<pre><code>for y in range(1, row_limit):
    print()
    print((row_limit-y-1) * "" "" + ''.join([str(x%10) for x in range(y, 2*y)]) + \
              ''.join([str(x%10) for x in range(2*(y-1), y-1, -1)]), end="""")

print()
</code></pre>

<p>Each of the loops is turned into a list comprehension, such as:</p>

<pre><code>[str(x%10) for x in range(y, 2*y)]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, this list of characters is joined with no interstitial character; this forms half of the row.  The second half of the row is the other loop (counting down).  In front of all this, I concatenate the proper number of spaces.</p>

<p>Frankly, I prefer my first form.</p>

<pre><code>    while points &lt; score_limit:
        points = random.choice(quest_list)(points)
        time.sleep(2)

<p>I'm assuming that <code>quest_list</code> is a list of functions, and you're passing the <code>points</code> value as an argument? To make this example work, you'll also want to return the points from the function returned by the <code>quest_list</code> that's called. A perhaps cleaner way to build this would be to return only the points generated by the quest. Then you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>        quest = random.choice(quest_list)
        points += quest()
</code></pre>

<p>Unless <code>points</code> is a mutable data structure, it won't change the value. You can read more about that in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15148496/python-passing-an-integer-by-reference"">this StackOverflow question</a>. </p>
