One note for python is that most of the frameworks for python web development can be plugged right into any current project. With ruby on rails, you're practically working in a DSL that anyone who uses your project will have to learn.  If they know python, then they can figure out what you are doing with django, etc in a day.

A typical mistake is to write something like:

The second call (os.unlink) may fail if something else deleted it after your if test, raise an Exception, and stop the rest of your function from executing.  (You might think this doesn't happen in real life, but we just fished another bug like that out of our codebase last week - and it was the kind of bug that left a few programmers scratching their head and claiming 'Heisenbug' for the last few months)

Generally, this is just fine.  If it's important to you that the ENUM type is used at the database level, you have three options:

Use ""./manage.py sql appname"" to see the SQL Django generates, manually modify it to use the ENUM type, and run it yourself.  If you create the table manually first, ""./manage.py syncdb"" won't mess with it.
If you don't want to do this manually every time you generate your DB, put some custom SQL in appname/sql/modelname.sql to perform the appropriate ALTER TABLE command.
Create a custom field type and define the db_type method appropriately.

With any of these options, it would be your responsibility to deal with the implications for cross-database portability.  In option 2, you could use database-backend-specific custom SQL to ensure your ALTER TABLE is only run on MySQL.  In option 3, your db_type method would need to check the database engine and set the db column type to a type that actually exists in that database.
UPDATE: Since the migrations framework was added in Django 1.7, options 1 and 2 above are entirely obsolete. Option 3 was always the best option anyway. The new version of options 1/2 would involve a complex custom migration using  -- but really you want option 3.

  on the same physical machine or in

  architect your application around

If you want to use multi core, pyprocessing defines an process based API to do real parallelization. The PEP also includes some interesting benchmarks.

31412,31412,1,"I am developing a GPL-licensed application in Python and need to know if the GPL allows my program to use proprietary plug-ins. This is what the FSF has to say on the issue:

If a program released under the GPL uses plug-ins, what are the requirements for the licenses of a plug-in?
It depends on how the program invokes its plug-ins. If the program uses fork and exec to invoke plug-ins, then the plug-ins are separate programs, so the license for the main program makes no requirements for them.
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, and they make function calls to each other and share data structures, we believe they form a single program, which must be treated as an extension of both the main program and the plug-ins. This means the plug-ins must be released under the GPL or a GPL-compatible free software license, and that the terms of the GPL must be followed when those plug-ins are distributed.
If the program dynamically links plug-ins, but the communication between them is limited to invoking the ‘main’ function of the plug-in with some options and waiting for it to return, that is a borderline case. 

The distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, besides being kind of artificial, doesn't carry over to interpreted languages: what about a Python/Perl/Ruby plugin, which gets loaded via  or ?
(edit: I understand why the distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, but it seems like someone who wanted to comply with the GPL but go against the ""spirit"" --I don't-- could just use fork/exec and interprocess communication to do pretty much anything).
The best solution would be to add an exception to my license to explicitly allow the use of proprietary plugins, but I am unable to do so since I'm using Qt/PyQt which is GPL.

I'm not sure that the distinction is artificial. After a dynamic load the plugin code shares an execution context with the GPLed code. After a fork/exec it does not.
In anycase I would guess that ing causes the new code to run in the same execution context as the GPLed bit, and you should treat it like the dynamic link case. No?

",65
31412,31421,2,"
he distinction between fork/exec and dynamic linking, besides being kind of artificial,

I don't think its artificial at all.  Basically they are just making the division based upon the level of integration.  If the program has ""plugins"" which are essentially fire and forget with no API level integration, then the resulting work is unlikely to be considered a derived work.  Generally speaking a plugin which is merely forked/exec'ed would fit this criteria, though there may be cases where it does not.  This case especially applies if the ""plugin"" code would work independently of your code as well.
If, on the other hand, the code is deeply dependent upon the GPL'ed work, such as extensively calling APIs, or tight data structure integration, then things are more likely to be considered a derived work.  Ie, the ""plugin"" cannot exist on its own without the GPL product, and a product with this plugin installed is essentially a derived work of the GPLed product.
So to make it a little more clear, the same principles could apply to your interpreted code.  If the interpreted code relies heavily upon your APIs (or vice-versa) then it would be considered a derived work.  If it is just a script that executes on its own with extremely little integration, then it may not.
Does that make more sense?

It's relying on undocumented internal implementation details of the admin, is likely to break again in future versions of Django, and is no easier to implement than just finding another JS calendar widget and using that.
That said, here's what you have to do if you're determined to make this work:

Define your own ModelForm subclass for your model (best to put it in forms.py in your app), and tell it to use the AdminDateWidget / AdminTimeWidget / AdminSplitDateTime (replace 'mydate' etc with the proper field names from your model):

Change your URLconf to pass 'form_class': ProductForm instead of 'model': Product to the generic create_object view (that'll mean ""from my_app.forms import ProductForm"" instead of ""from my_app.models import Product"", of course).
In the head of your template, include {{ form.media }} to output the links to the Javascript files.
And the hacky part: the admin date/time widgets presume that the i18n JS stuff has been loaded, and also require core.js, but don't provide either one automatically.  So in your template above {{ form.media }} you'll need:

You may also wish to use the following admin CSS (thanks Alex for mentioning this):


This implies that Django's admin media (ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX) is at /media/admin/ - you can change that for your setup.  Ideally you'd use a context processor to pass this values to your template instead of hardcoding it, but that's beyond the scope of this question.
This also requires that the URL /my_admin/jsi18n/ be manually wired up to the django.views.i18n.javascript_catalog view (or null_javascript_catalog if you aren't using I18N).  You have to do this yourself instead of going through the admin application so it's accessible regardless of whether you're logged into the admin (thanks Jeremy for pointing this out).

How can I merge two Python dictionaries in a single expression?

Say you have two dicts and you want to merge them into a new dict without altering the original dicts:

The desired result is to get a new dictionary () with the values merged, and the second dict's values overwriting those from the first.

A new syntax for this, proposed in PEP 448 and available as of Python 3.5, is 

And it is indeed a single expression. It is now showing as implemented in the release schedule for 3.5, PEP 478, and it has now made its way into What's New in Python 3.5 document.
However, since many organizations are still on Python 2, you may wish to do this in a backwards compatible way. The classically Pythonic way, available in Python 2 and Python 3.0-3.4, is to do this as a two-step process:

In both approaches,  will come second and its values will replace 's values, thus  will point to  in our final result.
Not yet on Python 3.5, but want a single expression
If you are not yet on Python 3.5, or need to write backward-compatible code, and you want this in a single expression, the most performant while correct approach is to put it in a function:

and then you have a single expression:

You can also make a function to merge an undefined number of dicts, from zero to a very large number:

This function will work in Python 2 and 3 for all dicts. e.g. given dicts  to :

and key value pairs in  will take precedence over dicts  to , and so on.
Critiques of Other Answers
Don't use what you see in the formerly accepted answer:

In Python 2, you create two lists in memory for each dict, create a third list in memory with length equal to the length of the first two put together, and then discard all three lists to create the dict. In Python 3, this will fail because you're adding two  objects together, not two lists - 

and you would have to explicitly create them as lists, e.g. . This is a waste of resources and computation power. 
Similarly, taking the union of  in Python 3 ( in Python 2.7) will also fail when values are unhashable objects (like lists, for example). Even if your values are hashable, since sets are semantically unordered, the behavior is undefined in regards to precedence. So don't do this:

This example demonstrates what happens when values are unhashable:

Here's an example where y should have precedence, but instead the value from x is retained due to the arbitrary order of sets:

Another hack you should not use:

This uses the  constructor, and is very fast and memory efficient (even slightly more-so than our two-step process) but unless you know precisely what is happening here (that is, the second dict is being passed as keyword arguments to the dict constructor), it's difficult to read, it's not the intended usage, and so it is not Pythonic. 
Here's an example of the usage being remediated in django.
Dicts are intended to take hashable keys (e.g. frozensets or tuples), but this method fails in Python 3 when keys are not strings.

From the mailing list, Guido van Rossum, the creator of the language, wrote:

I am fine with
  declaring dict({}, **{1:3}) illegal, since after all it is abuse of
  the ** mechanism.

and 

Apparently dict(x, **y) is going around as ""cool hack"" for ""call
  x.update(y) and return x"". Personally I find it more despicable than
  cool.

It is my understanding (as well as the understanding of the creator of the language) that the intended usage for  is for creating dicts for readability purposes, e.g.:

instead of 

Response to comments

Despite what Guido says,  is in line with the dict specification, which btw. works for both Python 2 and 3. The fact that this only works for string keys is a direct consequence of how keyword parameters work and not a short-comming of dict. Nor is using the ** operator in this place an abuse of the mechanism, in fact ** was designed precisely to pass dicts as keywords. 

Again, it doesn't work for 3 when keys are non-strings. The implicit calling contract is that namespaces take ordinary dicts, while users must only pass keyword arguments that are strings. All other callables enforced it.  broke this consistency in Python 2:

This inconsistency was bad given other implementations of Python (Pypy, Jython, IronPython). Thus it was fixed in Python 3, as this usage could be a breaking change.
I submit to you that it is malicious incompetence to intentionally write code that only works in one version of a language or that only works given certain arbitrary constraints.
Another comment:

 is still the most readable solution for Python 2. Readability counts. 

My response:  actually seems much clearer to me, if we're actually concerned about readability. And it is not forward compatible, as Python 2 is increasingly deprecated.
Less Performant But Correct Ad-hocs
These approaches are less performant, but they will provide correct behavior.
They will be much less performant than  and  or the new unpacking because they iterate through each key-value pair at a higher level of abstraction, but they do respect the order of precedence (latter dicts have precedence)
You can also chain the dicts manually inside a dict comprehension:

or in python 2.6 (and perhaps as early as 2.4 when generator expressions were introduced):

 will chain the iterators over the key-value pairs in the correct order:

",50
38987,49492,2,"This probably won't be a popular answer, but you almost certainly do not want to do this.  If you want a copy that's a merge, then use copy (or deepcopy, depending on what you want) and then update.  The two lines of code are much more readable - more Pythonic - than the single line creation with .items() + .items().  Explicit is better than implicit.
In addition, when you use .items() (pre Python 3.0), you're creating a new list that contains the items from the dict.  If your dictionaries are large, then that is quite a lot of overhead (two large lists that will be thrown away as soon as the merged dict is created).  update() can work more efficiently, because it can run through the second dict item-by-item.
In terms of time:

IMO the tiny slowdown between the first two is worth it for the readability.  In addition, keyword arguments for dictionary creation was only added in Python 2.3, whereas copy() and update() will work in older versions.
",209
38987,228366,2,"In a follow-up answer, you asked about the relative performance of these two alternatives:

On my machine, at least (a fairly ordinary x86_64 running Python 2.5.2), alternative  is not only shorter and simpler but also significantly faster.  You can verify this for yourself using the  module that comes with Python.
Example 1: identical dictionaries mapping 20 consecutive integers to themselves:

 wins by a factor of 3.5 or so.  Different dictionaries seem to yield quite different results, but  always seems to come out ahead.  (If you get inconsistent results for the same test, try passing in  with a number larger than the default 3.)
Example 2: non-overlapping dictionaries mapping 252 short strings to integers and vice versa:

 wins by about a factor of 10.  That's a pretty big win in my book!
After comparing those two, I wondered if 's poor performance could be attributed to the overhead of constructing the two item lists, which in turn led me to wonder if this variation might work better:

A few quick tests, e.g.

lead me to conclude that  is somewhat faster than , but not nearly as fast as .  Definitely not worth all the extra typing.
This discussion is still missing something important, which is a performance comparison of these alternatives with the ""obvious"" way of merging two lists: using the  method.  To try to keep things on an equal footing with the expressions, none of which modify x or y, I'm going to make a copy of x instead of modifying it in-place, as follows:

A typical result:

In other words,  and  seem to have essentially identical performance.  Do you think this might be a coincidence?  I don't....
In fact, I'd go so far as to claim that it's impossible for pure Python code to do any better than this.  And if you can do significantly better in a C extension module, I imagine the Python folks might well be interested in incorporating your code (or a variation on your approach) into the Python core.  Python uses  in lots of places; optimizing its operations is a big deal.
You could also write this as

as Tony does, but (not surprisingly) the difference in notation turns out not to have any measurable effect on performance.  Use whichever looks right to you.  Of course, he's absolutely correct to point out that the two-statement version is much easier to understand.

Note: this has become a popular answer, but it is important to point out that if  has any non-string keys, the fact that this works at all is an abuse of a CPython implementation detail, and it does not work in Python 3, or in PyPy, IronPython, or Jython. Also, Guido is not a fan. So I can't recommend this technique for forward-compatible or cross-implementation portable code, which really means it should be avoided entirely.

While  is great for throwaway scripts, I would be wary of using it in real code because admittedly it's not very readable or familiar. In real (production) code it's worthwhile to spend just a few more lines of code to make the process explicit and thus make the code readable.
There are two options:

The file is not overly large, and you can just read it wholly to memory. Then close the file, reopen it in writing mode and write the modified contents back.
The file is too large to be stored in memory; you can move it over to a temporary file and open that, reading it line by line, writing back into the original file. Note that this requires twice the storage.

all .py files (didn't know how to make packages work)
all .html templates for main level pages

separate folders for css, images, js, etc.
folders that hold .html templates for subdirecty-type urls

Subfolder for templates.  Folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy

Main Folder containing appdef, indexes, main.py?

Subfolder for code + templates.

So, what language should I learn to bridge between Python to C

",22
49195,49502,2,"Languages are easy to learn (especially one like C)... the hard part is learning the libraries and/or coding style of the language.  For instance, I know C++ fairly well, but most C/C++ code I see confuses me because the naming conventions are so different from what I work with on a daily basis.
Anyway, I guess what I'm trying to say is don't worry too much about the syntax, focus on said language's library.  This isn't specific to C, you can say the same about c#, vb.net, java and just about every other language out there.

",18
49195,49285,2,"I generally agree with most of the others - There's not really a good stepping stone language.
It is, however, useful to understand what is difficult about learning C, which might help you understand what's making it difficult for you.
I'd say the things that would prove difficult in C for someone coming from PHP would be :

Pointers and memory management This is pretty much the reason you're learning C I imagine, so there's not really any getting around it. Learning lower level assembly type languages might make this easier, but C is probably a bridge to do that, not the other way around.
Lack of built in data structures PHP and co all have native String types, and useful things like hash tables built in, which is not the case in C. In C, a String is just an array of characters, which means you'll need to do a lot more work, or look seriously at libraries which add the features you're used to.
Lack of built in libraries Languages like PHP nowadays almost always come with stacks of libraries for things like database connections, image manipulation and stacks of other things. In C, this is not the case other than a very thin standard library which revolves mostly around file reading, writing and basic string manipulation. There are almost always good choices available to fill these needs, but you need to include them yourself.
Suitability for high level tasks If you try to implement the same type of application in C as you might in PHP, you'll find it very slow going. Generating a web page, for example, isn't really something plain C is suited for, so if you're trying to do that, you'll find it very slow going.
Preprocessor and compilation Most languages these days don't have a preprocessor, and if you're coming from PHP, the compilation cycle will seem painful. Both of these are performance trade offs in a way - Scripting languages make the trade off in terms of developer efficiency, where as C prefers performance.

I'm sure there are more that aren't springing to mind for me right now. The moral of the story is that trying to understand what you're finding difficult in C may help you proceed. If you're trying to generate web pages with it, try doing something lower level. If you're missing hash tables, try writing your own, or find a library. If you're struggling with pointers, stick with it :)

You will, however, learn a similar concept... references (or objects in general).

51553,51553,1,"I need a real DBA's opinion. Postgres 8.3 takes 200 ms to execute this query on my Macbook Pro while Java and Python perform the same calculation in under 20 ms (350,000 rows):

Is this normal behaviour when using a SQL database?
The schema (the table holds responses to a survey):

I wrote some tests in Java and Python for context and they crush SQL (except for pure python):

Even sqlite3 is competitive with Postgres despite it assumping all columns are strings (for contrast: even using just switching to numeric columns instead of integers in Postgres results in 10x slowdown)
Tunings i've tried without success include (blindly following some web advice):

So my question is, is my experience here normal, and this is what I can expect when using a SQL database?  I can understand that ACID must come with costs, but this is kind of crazy in my opinion.  I'm not asking for realtime game speed, but since Java can process millions of doubles in under 20 ms, I feel a bit jealous. 
Is there a better way to do simple OLAP on the cheap (both in terms of money and server complexity)?  I've looked into Mondrian and Pig + Hadoop but not super excited about maintaining yet another server application and not sure if they would even help.

No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.
The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)
I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.
The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.
I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)
",463
51553,51668,2,"I don't think that your results are all that surprising -- if anything it is that Postgres is so fast.
Does the Postgres query run faster a second time once it has had a chance to cache the data?  To be a little fairer your test for Java and Python should cover the cost of acquiring the data in the first place (ideally loading it off disk).
If this performance level is a problem for your application in practice but you need a RDBMS for other reasons then you could look at memcached.  You would then have faster cached access to raw data and could do the calculations in code.
",118
51553,51933,2,"Those are very detailed answers, but they mostly beg the question, how do I get these benefits without leaving Postgres given that the data easily fits into memory, requires concurrent reads but no writes and is queried with the same query over and over again.
Is it possible to precompile the query and optimization plan? I would have thought the stored procedure would do this, but it doesn't really help.
To avoid disk access it's necessary to cache the whole table in memory, can I force Postgres to do that?  I think it's already doing this though, since the query executes in just 200 ms after repeated runs.
Can I tell Postgres that the table is read only, so it can optimize any locking code?
I think it's possible to estimate the query construction costs with an empty table (timings range from 20-60 ms) 
I still can't see why the Java/Python tests are invalid.  Postgres just isn't doing that much more work (though I still haven't addressed the concurrency aspect, just the caching and query construction)
UPDATE: 
I don't think it's fair to compare the SELECTS as suggested by pulling 350,000 through the driver and serialization steps into Python to run the aggregation, nor even to omit the aggregation as the overhead in formatting and displaying is hard to separate from the timing.  If both engines are operating on in memory data, it should be an apples to apples comparison, I'm not sure how to guarantee that's already happening though.
I can't figure out how to add comments, maybe i don't have enough reputation?
",304
51553,51745,2,"I would say your test scheme is not really useful. To fulfill the db query, the db server goes through several steps:

parse the SQL
work up a query plan, i. e. decide on which indices to use (if any), optimize etc.
if an index is used, search it for the pointers to the actual data, then go to the appropriate location in the data or
if no index is used, scan the whole table to determine which rows are needed
load the data from disk into a temporary location (hopefully, but not necessarily, memory)
perform the count() and avg() calculations

So, creating an array in Python and getting the average basically skips all these steps save the last one. As disk I/O is among the most expensive operations a program has to perform, this is a major flaw in the test (see also the answers to this question I asked here before). Even if you read the data from disk in your other test, the process is completely different and it's hard to tell how relevant the results are.
To obtain more information about where Postgres spends its time, I would suggest the following tests:

Compare the execution time of your query to a SELECT without the aggregating functions (i. e. cut step 5)
If you find that the aggregation leads to a significant slowdown, try if Python does it faster, obtaining the raw data through the plain SELECT from the comparison.

To speed up your query, reduce disk access first. I doubt very much that it's the aggregation that takes the time.
There's several ways to do that:

Cache data (in memory!) for subsequent access, either via the db engine's own capabilities or with tools like memcached
Reduce the size of your stored data
Optimize the use of indices. Sometimes this can mean to skip index use altogether (after all, it's disk access, too). For MySQL, I seem to remember that it's recommended to skip indices if you assume that the query fetches more than 10% of all the data in the table.
If your query makes good use of indices, I know that for MySQL databases it helps to put indices and data on separate physical disks. However, I don't know whether that's applicable for Postgres.
There also might be more sophisticated problems such as swapping rows to disk if for some reason the result set can't be completely processed in memory. But I would leave that kind of research until I run into serious performance problems that I can't find another way to fix, as it requires knowledge about a lot of little under-the-hood details in your process.

Update:
I just realized that you seem to have no use for indices for the above query and most likely aren't using any, too, so my advice on indices probably wasn't helpful. Sorry. Still, I'd say that the aggregation is not the problem but disk access is. I'll leave the index stuff in, anyway, it might still have some use.

51553,53333,2,"I retested with MySQL specifying ENGINE = MEMORY and it doesn't change a thing (still 200 ms).  Sqlite3 using an in-memory db gives similar timings as well (250 ms).
The math here looks correct (at least the size, as that's how big the sqlite db is :-)
I'm just not buying the disk-causes-slowness argument as there is every indication the tables are in memory (the postgres guys all warn against trying too hard to pin tables to memory as they swear the OS will do it better than the programmer)
To clarify the timings, the Java code is not reading from disk, making it a totally unfair comparison if Postgres is reading from the disk and calculating a complicated query, but that's really besides the point, the DB should be smart enough to bring a small table into memory and precompile a stored procedure IMHO.
UPDATE (in response to the first comment below):
I'm not sure how I'd test the query without using an aggregation function in a way that would be fair, since if i select all of the rows it'll spend tons of time serializing and formatting everything.  I'm not saying that the slowness is due to the aggregation function, it could still be just overhead from concurrency, integrity, and friends.

51553,53303,2,"I'm a MS-SQL guy myself, and we'd use DBCC PINTABLE to keep a table cached, and SET STATISTICS IO to see that it's reading from cache, and not disk. 
I can't find anything on Postgres to mimic PINTABLE, but pg_buffercache seems to give details on what is in the cache - you may want to check that, and see if your table is actually being cached.
A quick back of the envelope calculation makes me suspect that you're paging from disk. Assuming Postgres uses 4-byte integers, you have (6 * 4) bytes per row, so your table is a minimum of (24 * 350,000) bytes ~ 8.4MB. Assuming 40 MB/s sustained throughput on your HDD, you're looking at right around 200ms to read the data (which, as pointed out, should be where almost all of the time is being spent). 
Unless I screwed up my math somewhere, I don't see how it's possible that you are able to read 8MB into your Java app and process it in the times you're showing - unless that file is already cached by either the drive or your OS.

I've also done some checking into the cache sizes, and it seems Postgres relies on the OS to handle caching, they specifically mention BSD as the ideal OS for this, so I thinking Mac OS ought to be pretty smart about bringing the table into memory.  Unless someone has more specific params in mind I think more specific caching is out of my control.
In the end I can probably put up with 200 ms response times, but knowing that 7 ms is a possible target makes me feel unsatisfied, as even 20-50 ms times would enable more users to have more up to date queries and get rid of a lots of caching and precomputed hacks.
I just checked the timings using MySQL 5 and they are slightly worse than Postgres.  So barring some major caching breakthroughs, I guess this is what I can expect going the relational db route.
I wish I could up vote some of your answers, but I don't have enough points yet.

If the values don't have to be 100% spot on, or if the table is updated rarely, but you are running this calculation often, you might want to look into Materialized Views to speed it up.
(Note, I have not used materialized views in Postgres, they look at little hacky, but might suite your situation).
Materialized Views
Also consider the overhead of actually connecting to the server and the round trip required to send the request to the server and back.
I'd consider 200ms for something like this to be pretty good, A quick test on my oracle server, the same table structure with about 500k rows and no indexes, takes about 1 - 1.5 seconds, which is almost all just oracle sucking the data off disk.
The real question is, is 200ms fast enough?
-------------- More --------------------
I was interested in solving this using materialized views, since I've never really played with them. This is in oracle.
First I created a MV which refreshes every minute.

While its refreshing, there is no rows returned

Once it refreshes, its MUCH faster than doing the raw query

If we insert into the base table, the result is not immediately viewable view the MV.

But wait a minute or so, and the MV will update behind the scenes, and the result is returned fast as you could want.

This isn't ideal. for a start, its not realtime, inserts/updates will not be immediately visible. Also, you've got a query running to update the MV whether you need it or not (this can be tune to whatever time frame, or on demand). But, this does show how much faster an MV can make it seem to the end user, if you can live with values which aren't quite upto the second accurate.

You generate your content using Doxygen, or you generate your content using Sphinx*.

Doxygen: It is not the tool of choice for most Python projects. But if you have to deal with other related projects written in C or C++ it could make sense. For this you can improve the integration between Doxygen and Python using doxypypy.
Sphinx: The defacto tool for documenting a Python project. You have three options here: manual, semi-automatic (stub generation) and fully automatic (Doxygen like). 

For manual API documentation you have Sphinx autodoc. This is great to write a user guide with embedded API generated elements.
For semi-automatic you have Sphinx autosummary. You can either setup your build system to call sphinx-autogen or setup your Sphinx with the  config. You will require to setup a page with the autosummaries, and then manually edit the pages. You have options, but my experience with this approach is that it requires way too much configuration, and at the end even after creating new templates, I found bugs and the impossibility to determine exactly what was exposed as public API and what not. My opinion is this tool is good for stub generation that will require manual editing, and nothing more. Is like a shortcut to end up in manual.
Fully automatic. This have been criticized many times and for long we didn't have a good fully automatic Python API generator integrated with Sphinx until AutoAPI came, which is a new kid in the block. This is by far the best for automatic API generation in Python (note: shameless self-promotion).


There are other options to note:

Breathe: this started as a very good idea, and makes sense when you work with several related project in other languages that use Doxygen. The idea is to use Doxygen XML output and feed it to Sphinx to generate your API. So, you can keep all the goodness of Doxygen and unify the documentation system in Sphinx. Awesome in theory. Now, in practice, the last time I checked the project wasn't ready for production.
pydoctor*: Very particular. Generates its own output. It has some basic integration with Sphinx, and some nice features.

You can use doxygen to document your Python code. You can either use the Python documentation string syntax:

In which case the comments will be extracted by doxygen, but you won't be able to use any of the special doxygen commands.
Or you can (similar to C-style languages under doxygen) double up the comment marker () on the first line before the member:

In that case, you can use the special doxygen commands. There's no particular Python output mode, but you can apparently improve the results by setting  to .
Honestly, I'm a little surprised at the difference - it seems like once doxygen can detect the comments in ## blocks or """""" blocks, most of the work would be done and you'd be able to use the special commands in either case. Maybe they expect people using """""" to adhere to more Pythonic documentation practices and that would interfere with the special doxygen commands?

Shoes takes things from web devlopment (like  style colour notation, CSS layout techniques, like ), and from ruby (extensively using blocks in sensible ways)
Python's lack of ""rubyish blocks"" makes a (metaphorically)-direct port impossible:

No where near as clean, and wouldn't be nearly as flexible, and I'm not even sure if it would be implementable.
Using decorators seems like an interesting way to map blocks of code to a specific action:

Basically the decorator function stores the function, then when the action occurred (say, a click) the appropriate function would be executed.

The idea would be to interpret some containers (like windows) as simple classes, some containers (like tables, v/hboxes) recognized by object names, and simple widgets as objects.
I dont think one would have to name all containers inside a window, so some shortcuts (like old-style classes being recognized as widgets by names) would be desirable.
About the order of elements: in MyWindow above you don't have to track this (window is conceptually a one-slot container). In other containers you can try to keep track of the order assuming that each widget constructor have access to some global widget list. This is how it is done in django (AFAIK).
Few hacks here, few tweaks there... There are still few things to think of, but I believe it is possible... and usable, as long as you don't build complicated UIs.
However I am pretty happy with PyGTK+Glade. UI is just kind of data for me and it should be treated as data. There's just too much parameters to tweak (like spacing in different places) and it is better to manage that using a GUI tool. Therefore I build my UI in glade, save as xml and parse using gtk.glade.XML().

If I were to design a Pythonic GUI library, I would support something similar, to aid rapid development. The only difference is that I would ensure that the widgets have a more pythonic interface too. The current PyGTK classes seem very C to me, except that I use foo.bar(...) instead of bar(foo, ...) though I'm not sure exactly what I'd do differently. Probably allow for a Django models style declarative means of specifying widgets and events in code and allowing you to access data though iterators (where it makes sense, eg widget lists perhaps), though I haven't really thought about it.

58711,336089,2,"Here's an approach that goes about GUI definitions a bit differently using class-based meta-programming rather than inheritance.
This is largley Django/SQLAlchemy inspired in that it is heavily based on meta-programming and separates your GUI code from your ""code code"".  I also think it should make heavy use of layout managers like Java does because when you're dropping code, no one wants to constantly tweak pixel alignment.  I also think it would be cool if we could have CSS-like properties.
Here is a rough brainstormed example that will show a column with a label on top, then a text box, then a button to click on the bottom which shows a message.

from happygui.controls import *

MAIN_WINDOW = Window(width=""500px"", height=""350px"",
    my_layout=ColumnLayout(padding=""10px"",
        my_label=Label(text=""What's your name kiddo?"", bold=True, align=""center""),

        my_btn=Button(text=""CLICK ME!"", on_click=Handler('module.file.btn_clicked')),
    ),
)

    name = MAIN_WINDOW.my_layout.my_edit.text
    # same thing: name = sender.parent.my_edit.text
    # best practice, immune to structure change: MAIN_WINDOW.find('my_edit').text
    MessageBox(""Your name is '%s'"" % ()).show(modal=True)

One cool thing to notice is the way you can reference the input of my_edit by saying .  In the declaration for the window, I think it's important to be able to arbitrarily name controls in the function kwargs.
Here is the same app only using absolute positioning (the controls will appear in different places because we're not using a fancy layout manager):

from happygui.controls import *

MAIN_WINDOW = Window(width=""500px"", height=""350px"",
    my_label=Label(text=""What's your name kiddo?"", bold=True, align=""center"", x=""10px"", y=""10px"", width=""300px"", height=""100px""),
    my_edit=EditBox(placeholder="""", x=""10px"", y=""110px"", width=""300px"", height=""100px""),
    my_btn=Button(text=""CLICK ME!"", on_click=Handler('module.file.btn_clicked'), x=""10px"", y=""210px"", width=""300px"", height=""100px""),

I end up putting my test modules somewhere beside the core modules. 
The main reason for doing this is: refactoring.
When I move things around I do want test modules to move with the code; it's easy to lose tests if they are in a separate tree. Let's be honest, sooner or later you end up with a totally different folder structure, like django, flask and many others. Which is fine if you don't care.
The main question you should ask yourself is this:  
Am I writing:  

a) reusable library or  
b) building a project than bundles together some semi-separated modules?

If a: 
A separate folder and the extra effort to maintain its structure may be better suited. No one will complain about your tests getting deployed to production. 
But it's also just as easy to exclude tests from being distributed when they are mixed with the core folders; put this in the setup.py:

If b: 
You may wish — as every one of us do — that you are writing reusable libraries, but most of the time their life is tied to the life of the project. Ability to easily maintain your project should be a priority. 
Then if you did a good job and your module is a good fit for another project, it will probably get copied — not forked or made into a separate library — into this new project, and moving tests that lay beside it in the same folder structure is easy in comparison to fishing up tests in a mess that a separate test folder had become. (You may argue that it shouldn't be a mess in the first place but let's be realistic here).

It gets a little trickier with arbitrary objects. If you care about object identity, i.e., whether the same objects are in both lists, you can use the  function as the sort key.

(In Python 2.x you don't actually need the  parameter, because you can compare any object to any object. The ordering is arbitrary but stable, so it works fine for this purpose; it doesn't matter what order the objects are in, only that the ordering is the same for both lists. In Python 3, though, comparing objects of different types is disallowed in many circumstances -- for example, you can't compare strings to integers -- so if you will have objects of various types, best to explicitly use the object's ID.)
If you want to compare the objects in the list by value, on the other hand, first you need to define what ""value"" means for the objects. Then you will need some way to provide that as a key (and for Python 3, as a consistent type). One potential way that would work for a lot of arbitrary objects is to sort by their . Of course, this could waste a lot of extra time and memory building  strings for large lists and so on.

If the objects are all your own types, you can define  on them so that the object knows how to compare itself to others. Then you can just sort them and not worry about the  parameter. Of course you could also define  and use , which will be faster.

Your sampling shows that reading takes 24 seconds. Writing should therefore require about two minutes. The reading and writing times can be improved using an SSD for example.
When I convert files (using programs I write in C) I assume that a conversion should take no more time than it takes to read the data itself, a lot less is usually possible. Overlapped reads and writes can also reduce the I/O time. I write my own custom formatting routines since printf is usually far too slow.
How much is 24 seconds? On a modern CPU at least 40 billion instructions. That means that in that time you can process every single byte of data with at least 19 instructions. Easily doable for a C program but not for an interpreted language (Python, Java, C#, VB).
Your 525 second processing (549-24) remainder indicates that Python is spending at least 875 billion instructions processing or 415 instructions per byte of data read.

(And probably another run where the final post-conversion output is a no-op.)  Depending on where the time is going, it may make a lot more sense to attack one or the other.
You might be able to get the local OS to do some interleaving for you by writing the output to the Python's stdout, and having the shell do the actual file IO.  And similarly by streaming the file into stdin (e.g., )
What sort of storage are the input and output files on?  The storage characteristics may have a lot more to do with the performance than the Python code.
Update: Given the output is the slowest, and your storage is pretty slow and shared between both reads and writes, try adding some buffering.  From the python doc you should be able to add some buffering by adding a third argument to the  call.  Try something pretty large like 128*1024?

If you have model which represents this data, then its really easy using 

But why include django in this anyway? If you have CSV table, then updating this info is really a case of writing queries. and programs like Excel and openoffice make this very easy. 
If you already have data in CSV format, then just open the data as spreadsheet and use excels/openoffice's Concactenate function to create update queries

If you used openoffice for this, then openoffice has this nifty Text to columns function (under data in program menu), which turns concactenated values into string. Then you can copypaste those strings into command prompt or phppgadmin and run.. and voila, you get updated data in your database.
Edit (In response to you comment.):
Look into this: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#get-or-create
If you want to use django for this, then use get_or_create. But you need to remember here, that if any of the parameters you use in get_or_create method have changed, then new object will be created. Thats why i said in the beginning of the post, that you need some kind of data, which will not change.
for example (taken from the link above)

So to avoid this, you'll still need to do something like

I would first get network cards installed in everything.  If you want something that you can just plugin and go, look for any card compatible with NE2000.

From there, just enable the Windows File/Print Sharing service over TCP/IP, and you're good to go!  After you've done this, you can remotely manage and upgrade these machines, saving you a lot of headache later on.
Serial-Port Method
Deanna's suggestion of using the serial port as a network device and transferring files normally will work as well.  However, there is a bit of setup involved, and it can be a hassle if you've never done it.  There are several other software options.  I recommend LapLink.  It's fairly painless.
You could even go all-out and pickup a multi-port serial interface for fairly cheap these days, and manage these computers centrally.  RS232 is very robust and can go a long distance over the proper cabling.

I am trying also to give an interpretation to the model computed by libSVM, because I think that some dimensions are more ""important"" than others in the classification process.
For instance, consider the following example:

It is clear that the second dimension of x list's elements is useless to classify this data set.
My question is:
is there any systematic way to detect these kind of situations analyzing the model generated by libSVM?

It is your responsibility to check if a feature is important or not - so you have to choose your features manually that they meet your application's requirements.

A couple approaches.
One, give Tool a copy method that produces a new object that should equal the original object, but be a different instance. For example:

Then in Student's init you say

Option two, use a factory function.

I can't think any way in Python that you can write the line  and have object automagically make a copy, and I don't think you want to. One thing I like about Python is WYSIWYG. If you want magic use C++. I think it makes code hard to understand when you not only can't tell what a line of code is doing, you can't even tell it's doing anything special.

The watch_directories() function takes a list of paths and a callable object, and then repeatedly traverses the directory trees rooted at those paths, watching for files that get deleted or have their modification time changed. The callable object is then passed two lists containing the files that have changed and the files that have been removed.

This recipe is useful where you'd like some way to send jobs to a daemon, but don't want to use some IPC mechanism such as sockets or pipes. Instead, the daemon can sit and watch a submission directory, and jobs can be submitted by dropping a file or directory into the submission directory.
Locking is not taken into account. The watch_directories() function itself doesn't really need to do locking; if it misses a modification on one pass, it'll notice it on the next pass. However, if jobs are written directly into a watched directory, the callable object might start running while a job file is only half-written. To solve this, you can use a lockfile; the callable must acquire the lock when it runs, and submitters must acquire the lock when they wish to add a new job. A simpler approach is to rely on the rename() system call being atomic: write the job into a temporary directory that isn't being watched, and once the file is complete use os.rename() to move it into the submission directory.

So, if you want numbers that have a fixed number of digits after the decimal point (like for accounting applications), the decimal module is good; if you instead need to perform calculations with uncertainties, then the uncertainties module is appropriate.

Requirements:

Concurrency
Must identify the line numbers for each matching line
Good update performance

What I have looked into:

Lucene: To identify a line number, each line must be stored in a separate Lucene document, each containing two fields (the line number and the line). This makes updates hard/slow.
SOLR and Sphinx: Both based on Lucene, they have the same problem and do not allow for identifying the line number.
SQL table with a fulltext index: Again, no way to show the line number.
SQL table with each line in a separate row: Tested this with SQLite or MySQL, and update performance was the worst of all options. Updating a 50 MB document took more than an hour.
eXist-db: We converted each text file to XML like this: . Updates take ~5 minutes, which somewhat works but we are still not happy with it.
Whoosh for Python: Pretty much like Lucene. I have implemented a prototype that sort-of works by dropping/re-importing all lines of a given file. Updating a 50MB document takes about 2-3 minutes using this method.

Larsmans was curious about the performance of  on the kernel sources -- which is an excellent way to show how much performance gain  provides.

Once the cache was warm,  runs much faster:

Because my dataset fits entirely in RAM once the cache is warm,  is pretty amazing: it's only seven times slower than the  utility and certainly it would be more than fast enough for interactive use. If the dataset in question cannot be entirely cached (which is probably where things actually get interesting) then the performance benefit of the index is unmistakable.
The two complaints about idutils:

No pagination. This is definitely a downside, though in my experience it runs quickly enough to simply store the results of the search elsewhere. If the search is going to return an appreciable percentage of the original dataset, then storage of partial results is definitely going to be annoying.
No API: true enough, there's no API. But the source is available;  function  takes a linked list of files that match the output. A little fiddling with this function should even offer pagination. (It would take some doing.) At the end of the day, you'd have a C API, which might still not be ideal. But customizing it doesn't look awful.

However, the weakness that is probably worst is the lack of an incremental database update. If all files are updated three times per day, this is not a big deal. If some files are updated three times a day, it is doing needless work. If a handful of files are updated three times a day, there must be a better solution.

This is a shorthand for generating the views: it's not actually just getting a specific object.
Thus, those views aren't unique. The best way to explain it, I think, is with an example. Say you have 2 engines. You want to run some tasks on only engine one, and want the tasks to block. You want to run others on only engine one, but don't want them to block. You want to run yet more on engines 1 and 2, and don't want them to block. Then you could do:

Then, you can use these to run tasks in whatever way you'd like, eg

There's no actual magic being used here. When you run rc[0] twice, it generates two views. The second view is not the same as the first. When you assign rc[0] to a variable, and then use that variable, you're working with one view, and not creating a new one.

Idle thread functioality
Tasks may vary between architectures, but generally these are the tasks performed by idle threads:

Enable interrupts to allow pending interrupts be delivered
Disable interrupts (using  or  instructions, more on wiki)
On the  (or checked) builds, query if a kernel debugger is attached and allow breakpoints if been requested
Handle deferred procedure calls
Check if there are any runnable threads ready for execution. If there is one, update the idle processor control block with a pointer to the thread
Check the queues of other processors, if possible schedule thread awaiting execution on the idle processor
Call a power management routine, which may halt a processor or downgrade CPU tick rate and do other similar power saving activities

Additional info
When there are no runnable threads for a logical processor, Windows executes a kernel-mode idle thread. There is only 1 Idle process that has as many idle threads as there are logical processors. So on a Quad core machine with 4 logical/physical processors, there will be 1 Idle process and 4 idle threads.
In Windows, Idle process has ID = 0, so do all the Idle threads. These objects are represented by standard  and  data structures. But they are not executive manager processes and threads objects. There are no user-land address space and no user-land code is executed..
Idle process is statically allocated at system boot time before the process manager and object manager are set up. Idle thread structures are allocated dynamically as logical processors are brought live.
Idle thread priority is set to 0. However, this value doesn't actually matter as this thread only gets executed when there are no other threads available to run. Idle thread priority is never compared with priority of any other threads.
Idle threads are also special cases for preemption. The idle thread main routine  (implementation from reactos) performs several tasks that are not interrupted by other threads. When there are no runnable threads available to run on a processor, that processor is marked as idle in a processor control block. Then if a runnable threads arrives to the queue scheduled for execution, that thread's address pointer is stored in the  pointer of the idle processor control block. During the run of an idle thread, this pointer address gets checked on every iteration inside a  loop.

15688887,15689206,2,"Historically it's been a lot of different schemes, especially before reducing power consumption in idle was an issue.
Generally there is an ""idle"" process/task that runs at the lowest priority and hence always gets control when there's nothing else to do.  Many older systems would simply have this process run a ""do forever"" loop with nothing of consequence in the loop body.  One OS I heard of would run machine diagnostics in the idle process.  A number of early PCs would run a memory refresh routine (since memory needed to be cycled regularly or it would ""evaporate"").
(A benefit of this scheme is that 100% minus the % CPU used by the idle process gives you the % CPU utilization -- a feature that was appreciated by OS designers.)
But the norm on most modern systems is to either run a ""halt"" or ""wait"" instruction or have a special flag in the process control block that even more directly tells the processor to simply stop running and go into power-saving mode.
",196
15688887,15688958,2,"There's always code to run, the idle task is the code if there's nothing else. It may execute a special CPU instruction to power down the CPU until a hardware interrupt arrives. On x86 CPUs it's  (halt).
",46
15688887,15688937,2,"This depends on the OS and the CPU architecture. On x86 (Intel compatible) the operating system might execute HLT instructions, making the CPU wait until something interesting happens, such as a hardware interrupt. This supposedly consumes very little power. Operating systems report the time spent doing this as ""idle"" and may even assign it to a fictional ""idle"" process.
So, when in Windows task manager you see that the System Idle Process is consuming 90% CPU what it really means is that the CPU does not have an actual a program to run 90% of the time.

Using the  versions has a place, when you can replace  with the more compact , but not much outside of that. And you really shouldn't be using explicit calls to the corresponding ufunc, unless you want to use the  parameter to store the calculated values directly in an existing array.
That said, if what you are worried is performance, you should do fair comparisons, because as you say, all your calls are eventually handled by numpy's  ufunc.
If your data is already in a numpy array, then you have already shown that they are all performing similarly, so go with the  operator for clarity.
What if your data is in a python object, say a list? Well, here are some timings for you to ponder:

Not sure why  is so slow, but you clearly want to stay away from it. If you want to get a numpy array as output from a Python object input, then this will probably be the fastest:

Consider all examples using the following array:

'<' operator

operator.lt

numpy.less

Note that all of them achieve pretty much the equivalent performance and exactly the same results.  I'm guessing that all of these calls actually end up in the same function anyway since  and  both map to  on a numpy array, which is probably implemented using  or the equivalent?

15699566,15774990,2,"The cleanest solution would be inotify in many ways - this is more or less exactly what it's intended for, after all. If the log file was changing extremely rapidly then you could potentially risk being woken up almost constantly, which wouldn't necessarily be particularly efficient - however, you could always mitigate this by adding a short delay of your own after the inotify filehandle returns an event. In practice I doubt this would be an issue on most systems, but I thought it worth mentioning in case your system is very tight on CPU resources.
I can't see how the  approach would miss file updates except in cases where the file is truncated or rotated (i.e. renamed and another file of the same name created). These are tricky cases to handle however you do things, and you can use tricks like periodically re-opening the file by name to check for rotation. Read the  man page because it handles many such cases, and they're going to be quite common for log files in particular (log rotation being widely considered to be good practice).
The downside of  is of course that you'd end up batching up your reads with delays in between, and also that you have the overhead of constantly waking up and polling the file even when it's not changing. If you did this, say, once per second, however, the overhead probably isn't noticeable on most systems.
I'd say inotify is the best choice unless you want to remain compatible, in which case the simple fallback using  is still quite reasonable.
EDIT:
I just realised I forgot to mention - an easy way to check for a file being renamed is to perform an  on your open filehandle and a  on the filename you opened and compare the results. If the  fails then the error will tell you if the file's been deleted, and if not then comparing the  (the inode number) fields will tell you if the file's been deleted and then replaced with a new one of the same name.
Detecting truncation is harder - effectively your read pointer remains at the same offset in the file and reading will return nothing until the file content size gets back to where you were - then the file will read from that point as normal. If you call  frequently you could check for the file size going backwards - alternatively you could use  to record your current position in the file and then perform an explicit seek to the end of the file and call  again. If the value is lower, then the file's been truncated under you. This is a safe operation as long as you keep the original file position around because you can always seek back to it after the check.
Alternatively if you're using inotify anyway, you could just watch the parent directory for changes.
Note that files can be truncated to non-zero sizes, but I doubt that's likely to happen to a log file - the common cases will be being deleted and replaced, or truncated to zero. Also, I don't know how you'd detect the case that the file was truncated and then immediately filled back up to beyond your current position, except by remembering the most recent N characters and comparing them, but that's a pretty grotty thing to do. I think inotify will just tell you the file has been modified in that case.

Setting the optimization flag certainly makes a big difference.

C++ is a language that begs to be compiled optimized, particularly so if the code in question uses containers and iterators from the C++ standard library. A simple  shrinks from a good-sized chain of function calls when compiled unoptimized to one or two assembly statement when optimization is enabled.
That said, I knew what the compiler would do to your test code. Any decent optimizing compiler will make that  loop vanish. It's the as-if rule at work. That loop does nothing, so the compiler is free to treat it as if it wasn't even there.
When I look at the CPU behavior of a suspect CPU hog, I write a simple driver (in a separate file) that calls the suspect function a number of times, sometimes a very large number of times. I compile the functionality to be tested with optimization enabled, but I compile the driver with optimization disabled. I don't want a too-smart optimizing compiler to see that those 100,000 calls to  can be pulled out of the loop and then further optimize the loop away.
There are a number of solid reasons for calling the test function a number of times between the single call to start timer and stop timer. This is why python has the  module.

23503667,23504241,2,"This answer basically summarizes the approaches mentioned in the question and the comments, and adds some comparison/insights about them

Approach #1 -- checking all row-pairs
As you suggested, you can iterate over all row pairs, and compute the inner product. If , i.e. you have N rows of size M each, you end up with a O(M*N^2) complexity.
Approach #2 -- matrix multiplication
As suggested in the comments by @JoeKington, you can compute the multiplication , and check all the non-diagonal elements. Depending on the algorithm used for matrix multiplication, this can be faster than the naive O(M*N^2) algorithm, but only asymptotically better. Unless your matrices are big, they would be slower.

The advantages of approach #1:

You can ""short circuit"" -- quit the check as soon as you find the first non-orthogonal pair
requires less memory. In #2, you create a temporary NxN matrix.

The advantages of approach #2:

The multiplication is fast, as it is implemented in the heavily-optimized linear-algebra library (BLAS of ATLAS). I believe those libraries choose the right algorithm to use according to input size (i.e. they won't use the fancy algorithms on small matrices, because they are slower for small matrices. There's a big constant hidden behind that O-notation).
less code to write

My bet is that for small matrices, approach #2 would prove faster due to the fact the LA libraries are heavily optimized, and despite the fact they compute the entire multiplication, even after processing the first pair of non-orthogonal rows.

",6
23503667,23552362,2,"Approach #3: Compute the QR decomposition of AT
In general, to find an orthogonal basis of the range space of some matrix X, one can compute the QR decomposition of this matrix (using Givens rotations or Householder reflectors). Q is an orthogonal matrix and R upper triangular. The columns of Q corresponding to non-zero diagonal entries of R form an orthonormal basis of the range space.
If the columns of X=AT, i.e., the rows of A, already are orthogonal, then the QR decomposition will necessarily have the R factor diagonal, where the diagonal entries are plus or minus the lengths of the columns of X resp. the rows of A.
Common folklore has it that this approach is numerically better behaved than the computation of the product A*AT=RT*R. This may only matter for larger matrices. The computation is not as straightforward as the matrix product, however, the amount of operations is of the same size.

23516574,23559559,2,"Note: I'm making assumptions here since I'm unfamiliar with .H5 files and the Python code the accesses them.
I think that what is happening is that when you ""load"" the array, you're not actually loading an array. Instead, I think that an object is constructed on top of the file. It probably reads in dimensions and information related to how the file is organized, but it doesn't read the whole file.
That object mimicks an array so good that when you later on perform the slice operation, the normal Python slice operation can be executed, but at this point the actual data is being read. That's why the slice takes so long time compared to ""loading"" all the data.
I arrive at this conclusion because of the following.
If you're reading 75 frames of 3584x3584 pixels, I'm assuming they're uncompressed (H5 seems to be just raw dumps of data), and in that case, 75 * 3.584 * 3.584 = 963.379.200, this is around 918MB of data. Couple that with you ""reading"" this in 180ms, we get this calculation:

Note, this number is for 1-byte pixels, which is also unlikely.
This speed thus seems highly unlikely, as even the best SSDs today reach way below 1GB/sec.
It seems much more plausible that an object is just constructed on top of the file and the slice operation incurs the cost of reading at least 1 frame worth of data.
If we divide the speed by 75 to get per-frame speed, we get 68MB/sec speed for 1-byte pixels, and with 24 or 32-bit pixels we get up to 270MB/sec reading speeds. Much more plausible.

The slicing takes up a lot of time (1.76 s). I understand that my 2D array is huge but at some point I would like to loop over time which will take very long as I'm performing this slice within the  loop.

When you request access to the attribute named as such on  object it asks  class if it has this method (not  class), so  is always the same as .
From the documentation:

When an identifier that textually occurs in a class definition begins
  with two or more underscore characters and does not end in two or more
  underscores, it is considered a private name of that class. Private
  names are transformed to a longer form before code is generated for

How do I take object-based inputs and turn them into passable
  variables?

You access the controls and call the appropriate methods:

To pass them to your resize, function, just pass those values to your resize_file function.

You're asking too many questions here TBH.  You should start with one, and create others as you progress.
What the heck, I have time to kill before lunch!  I'll give you a few pointers.
Let's look at this function:

Looking at this function, I really have no idea what the inputs are to the function.  It says filename and an optional filename2.  Which of these is being resized?  How do I know what each parameter does?  You did not document this function, which made me dig off into your code to try to determine what it does.
So, I dug off into your code...  And it appears that this particular function resizes and possibly appends pdfs.  Notice how in your code, you execute the same code twice?

Don't do this.  Use the DRY principle.  You should have a loop, as the algorithm is basically the same.  (Can't illustrate the loop atm, running out of time before lunch, maybe when I get back :P)
You could even get fancy and have your function take an indefinite amount of PDF files.  Check this snippet out:

Ok, I lied, I tried to squeeze this in before lunch.  The code above may not work out of the box, but it should point you in the general direction.  You should add error catching to check for when no arguments are passed (among other things).
Hope it helps!

Here's my question.  I'd like to get rid of all the text-based user interaction.  How do I take object-based inputs and turn them into passable variables?  I've been able to implement wx.TextCtrl to enter user input and wx.FilePickerCtrl to select the PDF for the input.  Now how do I:

Pass these as variables to my resize_file function? 
Set the output location?
Set the backup location + input PDF name?
Pass the wx.TextCtrl values (for scale) to my resize_file function?

This also may be my problem:

I have a InitUI function doing all the wxPython stuff
The button within InitUi function calls resize_file_main
resize_file_main just handles inputs/outputs and moving the final
files around.  It also calls resize_file.
resize_file is a function that is re-used in several other areas
of the script.  It takes in the various inputs/outputs and actually
resizes the PDF(s).

The basic idea is to create a list to contain the lines of each text file, and then output the list to your new csv file.

I created two text files on my Desktop. They read as follows:

31248615,31248615,1,"I was trying to use ZMQ - PUSH - PULL to build a distributed task processing system. This was east to do using JMS in Java with a Queue and a listener;Listeners which are free could take the message of the queue and execute it.Once the queue is distributed across nodes, this acts like a load balancer.
With ZMQ (using Python - don't want to use Celery now), I was trying out PUSH and PULL. With the Worker having different processing time. However even when a worker is free, tasks are going in strictly  round robin fashion. That is irrespective of if a worker is free or not, the task goes  in a round robin way.
Is there any way of simulating a distributed queue with ZMQ patterns so that, I can have a pool of workers 'polling' the queue in each node and which ever is free pulls the message from the queue and process it.
",175
31248615,34895786,2,"As pointed out by 0MQ founder Pieter Hintjens in this answer, the PUSH-PULL mechanism is not a load balancer, but rather a simple round robin distributor. That's a typo in the docs that is still there.
That said, for the load balancing pattern you need to add a broker in the middle of your architecture. As pointed out by Jason in the comments, this is well explained in the official guide. There are also examples in Python.

The main idea is to have the workers sending a small ""READY"" message to the broker whenever they are free to receive more jobs. The broker in turns, keep ""pointers"" to free workers in a queue. When he receives a new job request from a client he also propagates the request to the first free worker in the queue, which gets popped out from the queue. As you can see in the picture above, the broker exploits ROUTER sockets in order to avoid a blocking behavior and to get proper load balancing. A small additional detail is that the broker does not poll the clients if there are not free workers in the queue.
This is the simplest way I am aware of for implementing a load balancing pattern with ZeroMQ. It is not exactly like ""polling"" for new jobs in the queue, but I think this is what you need. Also please beware that this is really the simplest way, that is, it is not reliable at all and it does not scale well as is. If you also need reliability, I suggest you to thoroughly read Chapter 4 of the official guide.
As a side note, maybe you should seriously consider Celery for this task. I am really in love with ZeroMQ, however this is exactly the kind of thing that Celery is very good at, and in my opinion it is not so difficult to learn, as someone may think.

However, the size of my dataset is 100GB (and I have RAM of size 64GB), therefore I can not keep this information in set form in main-memory.

31256397,31256671,2,"Keep a boolean hashtable of hash codes of lines already seen.
For each line:

if line hash()es to something you have already seen, you have a potential match: scan the file to check if it really is a duplicate.
if line hash()es to a new hash, just mark the hash for the first time.

Dedicate as much memory you can to this hashtable, and the false positive rate will be low (i.e. less times you will have to scan for duplicates and found none).
Example:

As it has been pointed out, since you cannot store all the lines in memory you don't have many options, but at least this option doesn't require to scan the file for every single line, because most of the entries in the table will be False, i.e. the algorithm is sub-quadratic if the tabe is not full; it will degenerate to O(n2) once the table is full.
You can make a very memory-efficient implementation of the hash table, that requires only 1 bit for each hash code (e.g. make it an array of bytes, where each byte can store 8 boolean values)

Use unix 'sort' to sort that new file, excluding the line number field. The sort utility will merge sort the file even if it exceeds the size of available memory. Now you have a new file in which the duplicates are ordered, along with their original line numbers. Extract the line numbers of the duplicates and then use that as input for linearly processing your original data. 
In more detailed steps. 

Make a new version of your file such that each line is prepended by its line number. So, ""someline"" becomes ""1, someline"" 
sort this file using the unix sort utility  - sort -t"","" -k2,2 file
Scan the new file for consecutive duplicate entries in the second field
the line numbers (first field) of such entries are the line numbers of duplicate lines in your original file - extract these and use them as input to remove duplicates in the original data. Since you know exactly where they are, you need not read in the entire file or create a giant in-memory structure for duplicates

The advantage of this method compared to some of the others suggested - it always works, regardless of the size of the input and the size of your available memory and it does not fail due to hash collisions or other probabilistic artifacts.

I'm collecting data from a few thousand network devices every few minutes in Python 2.7.8 via package . I'm also using  so that I can access the (more efficient) Net-SNMP command .
I'm trying to cut down how much memory my script uses. I'm running three instances of the same script which sleeps for two minutes before re-querying all devices for data we want. When I created the original script in  they would use less than 500MB when active simultaneously. As I've converted this over to Python, however, each instance hogs 4GB each which indicates (to me) that my data structures need to be managed more efficiently. Even when idle they're consuming a total of 4GB.

Code Activity
My script begins with creating a list where I open a file and append the hostname of our target devices as separate values. These usually contain 80 to 1200 names.

From there I set up the SNMP sessions and execute the requests

Because of how both SNMP packages behave, the device responses are parsed up into lists and stored into one giant data structure. For example,

I'm having to iterate through each response, combine related data, then output each device's complete response. This is a bit difficult For example,

Each device has a varying number of responses. I can't loop through expecting every device having a uniform arbitrary number of values to combine into a string to write out to a CSV.

How I'm handling the data
I believe it is here where I'm consuming a lot of memory but I cannot resolve how to simplify the process while simultaneously removing visited data.

Currently I'm creating a new dictionary, checking that the device response is not null, then appending the response value to a string that will be used to write out to the CSV file.
The problem with this is that I'm essentially cloning the existing dictionary, meaning I'm using twice as much system memory. I'd like to remove values that I've visited in  when I move them to  so that I'm not using so much RAM. Is there an efficient method of doing this? Is there also a better way of reducing the complexity of my code so that it's easier to follow?

The Culprit
Thanks to those who answered. For those in the future that stumble across this thread due to experiencing similar issues: the  package is the culprit behind the large use of system memory. The  function creates a thread for each host but does so all at once rather than putting some kind of upper limit. Since each instance of my script would handle up to 1200 devices that meant 1200 threads were instantiated and queued within just a few seconds. Using the  function was slower but still fast enough to suit my needs. The difference between the two was 4GB vs 250MB (of system memory use).

So since Python parses the file first, literals can be loaded effectively into the memory. Since Python knows that these are constant, all variables that represent those constant values can point to the same object in memory. So the object is shared.
This works for ints and floats, but even for strings; even when there is a constant expression that needs to be evaluated first:

For small integers, the situation is a bit different. Because they are often used, CPython stores a set of integers (in the range between -5 and 256) statically and makes that every value of these points to the same  object.

In computer science, in the context of data storage, serialization is the process of translating data structures or object state into a format that can be stored (for example, in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link) and reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Python picked the name  because it modelled the process on how this was handled in Modula-3, where it was also called pickling. See Pickles: Why are they called that?

If serializing and pickling is same process, why use different terms for them?

No, netTcpBinding is interoperable only with WCF clients. 
From here:

The default configuration for the NetTcpBinding is faster than the
  configuration provided by the WSHttpBinding, but it is intended only
  for WCF-to-WCF communication. 

From comments:

does wsHttpBinding work or only basicHttpBinding work?

Short answer is no, basicHttpBinding is the only binding (except for the web bindings) which support interoperability with non-wcf clients. Even then you may have difficulty consuming it from non-windows.
Long answer is that the reason this is the case is because basicHttpBinding supports communication over SOAP 1.1, which is a relatively simple protocol, and most vendors have implemented it in very similar ways. Therefore, these different implementations tend to be interoperable. However, wsHttpBinding is Microsoft's attempt to support the SOAP 1.2 protocol and WS-* web service extensions, which is a much larger and more complex set of standards. So there is a much larger scope for interpretation between the various vendors, leading normally to non-interoperability between implementations. It is theoretically possible, therefore, to call an endpoint exposed over wsHttpBinding from a non-wcf (or even non-windows) client, but you would have to overcome all the niggles.
A much better approach would be to move away from SOAP completely if possible, and just use HTTP/POX or HTTP/REST services.

Updated info: I'm storing a player's data into a MySQL database with SQLAlchemy everytime he leaves the gameserver, and I load it everytime he joins the server. These are handled through  and  events:

Also, the player's score is updated upon  event:

",221
38957961,39002736,2,"That kind of information can be pulled using SQLAlchemy's sort_by function. If you perform a Query like:

You will have the list of Players sorted by their score. Keep in mind that every time you do this you do an I/O with the database which can be rather slow instead of saving the data python variables. 
",61
38957961,39043000,2,"Redis sorted sets help with this exact situation (the documentation uses leader boards as the example usage) http://redis.io/topics/data-types-intro#redis-sorted-sets

The key commands you care about are ZADD (update player rank) and ZRANK (get rank for specific player). Both operations are O(log(N)) complexity.

Redis can be used as a cache of player ranking. When your application starts, populate redis from the SQL data. When updating player scores in mysql also update redis.
If you have multiple server processes/threads and they could trigger player score updates concurrently then you should also account for the mysql/redis update race condition, eg:

only update redis from a DB trigger; or
serialise player score updates; or
let data get temporarily out of sync and do another cache update after a delay; or
let data get temporarily out of sync and do a full cache rebuild at fixed intervals

",168
38957961,39000851,2,"The problem you have is that you want real-time updates against a database, which requires a db query each time. If you instead maintain a list of scores in memory, and update it at a more reasonable frequency (say once an hour, or even once a minute, if your players are really concerned with their rank), then the players will still experience real-time progress vs a score rank, and they can't really tell if there is a short lag in the updates.
With a sorted list of scores in memory, you can instantly get the player's rank (where by instantly, I mean O(lg n) lookup in memory) at the cost of the memory to cache, and of course the time to update the cache when you want to. Compared to a db query of 100k records every time someone wants to glance at their rank, this is a much better option.
Elaborating on the sorted list, you must query the db to get it, but you can keep using it for a while. Maybe you store the last_update, and re-query the db only if this list is ""too old"". So you update quickly by not trying to update all the time, but rather just enough to feel like real-time.
In order to find someone's rank nearly instantaneously, you use the bisect module, which supports binary search in a sorted list. The scores are sorted when you get them.

This says that a 7 score is rank 4, which is correct.

Lets address them in order. The problem with the  variable is that it is only defined in the  block, so if the module gets loaded without being run as a script (which is what sets ), it will not be defined when the later code runs.
To fix this, you can change how your code is structured. The simplest fix would be to guard the other bits of the code that use  within an  block too (e.g. indent them all under the current block, perhaps). An alternative fix would be to put the code that uses  into functions (which can be declared outside the guard block), then call the functions from within an  block. That would look something like this:

As for why the issue came up in the first place, the ultimate cause is using the  module on Windows. You can read about the issue in the documentation.
When multiprocessing creates a new process for its , it needs to initialize that process with a copy of the current module's state. Because Windows doesn't have  (which copies the parent process's memory into a child process automatically), Python needs to set everything up from scratch. In each child process, it loads the module from its file, and if you the module's top-level code tries to create a new , you'd have a recursive situation where each of the child process would start spawning a whole new set of child processes of its own.
The  code has some guards against that, I think (so you won't fork bomb yourself out of simple carelessness), but you still need to do some of the work yourself too, by using  to guard any code that shouldn't be run in the child processes.

While ssh isn't explicit about what that means, exactly, we know what execv(2) does: if execve(2) fails to execute its passed arguments, the execv function will invoke  with the same arguments (in this case, our quoted string).  The shell then evaluates the quoted string as separate arguments, detects the HereDoc redirection, and executes per usual.

There are several reasons why  might not be a good idea.  Usually, we expect addition to be commutative, but dict addition would fail whenever there were overlapping keys with distinct values.   The ""normal"" use case is to update only dict in-place, but the usual semantics of  would copy the contents of both inputs to create a new dict (which is somewhat wasteful).

So you can first find all the delimiters and preserve them in a proper container with their frequency, then find the most common and first one, then split your string based on them.
Now for finding the delimiters, you need to separate them from the plain text based on a particular feature, for example if they are none word characters, and for preserving them we can use a dictionary in order to preserve the count of similar delimiters (in this case  will do the job).

Update:
The question does not ask to split by first occurrence or most frequent delimiter simultaneously - any of this methods individually will be sufficient. I do understand that splitting by most frequent delimiter is not possible with regex without preliminary determination of the delimiter but I think there's a chance that splitting by first occurrence is possible with regex and lookahead without preparation made in advance.

38978182,39120531,2,"Since I wasn't able to implement an Observer to watch widgets like the ttk.Combobox, I've decided to create a workaround. Here are the steps I took, in order to achieve a MVC architecture from Bryan Oakleys example (link is in the question), which refreshes its model class via the controller class, whenever a user takes an action in the view (GUI). 
Step 1: Add a model class
First, in order to use a MVC architecture, we have to seperate the code into model, view and control. In this example, model is , control is  and view are the pages ,  and .
Step 2: Set up your model class
Now we have to decide on which variables we want to have in the model class. In this example, we have directories and keys (status of the comboboxes), which we want to save in dictionaries. After setting them up empty, all we have to do is add setters and getters for each variable, so we can refresh data in model and also retrieve some, if we want. Additionally, we could implement delet methods for each variable, if we wanted to.
Step 3: Add push and pull methods to the control class
Now that there is a model class, we can refrence it via e. g.  in  (control). Now we have the basic tools to set data in  via e. g.  and also get data from . Since we want our control class to do that, we need some methods, that can achieve this. So we add the push and pull methods to the  (e. g. ), which in turn can be refrenced from view (StartPage, PageOne, PageTwo) via controller.
Step 4: Add your widgets to the view class
Now we have to decide on which widgets shall be on which page and what you want them to do. In this example, there are buttons for navigation, which for the sake of the task can be ignored, two comboboxes and a button, which opens a file dialog. 
Here, we want the comboboxes to refresh their status whenever it is changed and send the new status via controller to the model. Whereas the  button of  shall open a file dialog, where the user then selects files he/she wants to open. The directories we got from this interaction then shall be send via controller to model.
Step 5: Get all your functionality into the controller class
Since there is a controller variable, we can use it to refrence methods, which are in the controller class. This way, we can outsource all our methods from the pages into the controller and reference them via self.controller.function_of_controller_class. But we have to be aware, that methods, which are bound to commands via  can't return any values, but they are also not called on programme startup. So keep that in mind.
Step 6: Set up your bindings and wrappers
Here we have to set up the  for our comboboxes. Since the controller allready is set up to store data and the comboboxes have a textvariable, we can use this to gather information about the status of the comboboxes via . All we have to do is to set up a wrapper which is called, whenever  is throwing an event.
Closing statement
Now we have it, a programme based on Bryan Oakleys example of ""How to get variable data from a class"", which utilises a model, which is updated via controller whenever the user takes a corresponding action in the view. Unfortunately it doesn't utilise a Observer class, as first intended, but I'll keep working on it and update this, when I've found a satisfying solution.

Now I'm trying to replicate that in Python. I've tried using the above code and many variations of it, but every time I receive the response 'FAILED_TO_PARSE_REQUEST_BODY'. What's different between the Ajax and Python calls that makes my request fail? 
This question is similar to this and this, but they deal with using the same key multiple times and incorrect data encoding, which I do not think applies in this case.

I'm assuming that  is a list of functions, and you're passing the  value as an argument? To make this example work, you'll also want to return the points from the function returned by the  that's called. A perhaps cleaner way to build this would be to return only the points generated by the quest. Then you could do something like:

Unless  is a mutable data structure, it won't change the value. You can read more about that in this StackOverflow question.
