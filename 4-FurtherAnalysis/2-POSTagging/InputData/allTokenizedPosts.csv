Python
uses
the
reference
count
method
to
handle
object
life
time
.
So
an
object
that
has
no
more
use
will
be
immediately
destroyed
.
But
","
in
Java
","
the
GC(garbage collector)
destroys
objects
which
are
no
longer
used
at
a
specific
time
.
Why
does
Java
choose
this
strategy
and
what
is
the
benefit
from
this
?
Is
this
better
than
the
Python
approach
?
There
are
drawbacks
of
using
reference
counting
.
One
of
the
most
mentioned
is
circular
references
:
Suppose
A
references
B
","
B
references
C
and
C
references
B
.
If
A
were
to
drop
its
reference
to
B
","
both
B
and
C
will
still
have
a
reference
count
of
1
and
won't
be
deleted
with
traditional
reference
counting
.
CPython
(
reference
counting
is
not
part
of
python
itself
","
but
part
of
the
C
implementation
thereof
)
catches
circular
references
with
a
separate
garbage
collection
routine
that
it
runs
periodically
...
Another
drawback
:
Reference
counting
can
make
execution
slower
.
Each
time
an
object
is
referenced
and
dereferenced
","
the
interpreter
/
VM
must
check
to
see
if
the
count
has
gone
down
to
0
(
and
then
deallocate
if
it
did
)
.
Garbage
Collection
does
not
need
to
do
this
.
Also
","
Garbage
Collection
can
be
done
in
a
separate
thread
(
though
it
can
be
a
bit
tricky
)
.
On
machines
with
lots
of
RAM
and
for
processes
that
use
memory
only
slowly
","
you
might
not
want
to
be
doing
GC
at
all
!
Reference
counting
would
be
a
bit
of
a
drawback
there
in
terms
of
performance
...
I
think
the
article
""""
Java
theory
and
practice
:
A
brief
history
of
garbage
collection
""""
from
IBM
should
help
explain
some
of
the
questions
you
have
.
The
latest
Sun
Java
VM
actually
have
multiple
GC
algorithms
which
you
can
tweak
.
The
Java
VM
specifications
intentionally
omitted
specifying
actual
GC
behaviour
to
allow
different
(
and
multiple
)
GC
algorithms
for
different
VMs
.
For
example
","
for
all
the
people
who
dislike
the
""""
stop-the-world
""""
approach
of
the
default
Sun
Java
VM
GC
behaviour
","
there
are
VM
such
as
IBM's
WebSphere
Real
Time
which
allows
real-time
application
to
run
on
Java
.
Since
the
Java
VM
spec
is
publicly
available
","
there
is
(
theoretically
)
nothing
stopping
anyone
from
implementing
a
Java
VM
that
uses
CPython's
GC
algorithm
.
Reference
counting
is
particularly
difficult
to
do
efficiently
in
a
multi-threaded
environment
.
I
don't
know
how
you'd
even
start
to
do
it
without
getting
into
hardware
assisted
transactions
or
similar
(
currently
)
unusual
atomic
instructions
.
Reference
counting
is
easy
to
implement
.
JVMs
have
had
a
lot
of
money
sunk
into
competing
implementations
","
so
it
shouldn't
be
surprising
that
they
implement
very
good
solutions
to
very
difficult
problems
.
However
","
it's
becoming
increasingly
easy
to
target
your
favourite
language
at
the
JVM
.
One
big
disadvantage
of
Java's
tracing
GC
is
that
from
time
to
time
it
will
""""
stop
the
world
""""
and
freeze
the
application
for
a
relatively
long
time
to
do
a
full
GC
.
If
the
heap
is
big
and
the
the
object
tree
complex
","
it
will
freeze
for
a
few
seconds
.
Also
each
full
GC
visits
the
whole
object
tree
over
and
over
again
","
something
that
is
probably
quite
inefficient
.
Another
drawback
of
the
way
Java
does
GC
is
that
you
have
to
tell
the
jvm
what
heap
size
you
want
(
if
the
default
is
not
good
enough
)
;
the
JVM
derives
from
that
value
several
thresholds
that
will
trigger
the
GC
process
when
there
is
too
much
garbage
stacking
up
in
the
heap
.
I
presume
that
this
is
actually
the
main
cause
of
the
jerky
feeling
of
Android
(
based
on
Java
)
","
even
on
the
most
expensive
cellphones
","
in
comparison
with
the
smoothness
of
iOS
(
based
on
ObjectiveC
","
and
using
RC
)
.
I'd
love
to
see
a
jvm
option
to
enable
RC
memory
management
","
and
maybe
keeping
GC
only
to
run
as
a
last
resort
when
there
is
no
more
memory
left
.
Late
in
the
game
","
but
I
think
one
significant
rationale
for
RC
in
python
is
its
simplicity
.
See
this
email
by
Alex
Martelli
","
for
example
.
(
I
could
not
find
a
link
outside
google
cache
","
the
email
date
from
13th
october
2005
on
python
list
)
.
Actually
reference
counting
and
the
strategies
used
by
the
Sun
JVM
are
all
different
types
of
garbage
collection
algorithms
.
There
are
two
broad
approaches
for
tracking
down
dead
objects
:
tracing
and
reference
counting
.
In
tracing
the
GC
starts
from
the
""""
roots
""""
-
things
like
stack
references
","
and
traces
all
reachable
(
live
)
objects
.
Anything
that
can't
be
reached
is
considered
dead
.
In
reference
counting
each
time
a
reference
is
modified
the
object's
involved
have
their
count
updated
.
Any
object
whose
reference
count
gets
set
to
zero
is
considered
dead
.
With
basically
all
GC
implementations
there
are
trade
offs
but
tracing
is
usually
good
for
high
through
put
(
i.e.
fast
)
operation
but
has
longer
pause
times
(
larger
gaps
where
the
UI
or
program
may
freeze
up
)
.
Reference
counting
can
operate
in
smaller
chunks
but
will
be
slower
overall
.
It
may
mean
less
freezes
but
poorer
performance
overall
.
Additionally
a
reference
counting
GC
requires
a
cycle
detector
to
clean
up
any
objects
in
a
cycle
that
won't
be
caught
by
their
reference
count
alone
.
Perl
5
didn't
have
a
cycle
detector
in
its
GC
implementation
and
could
leak
memory
that
was
cyclic
.
Research
has
also
been
done
to
get
the
best
of
both
worlds
(
low
pause
times
","
high
throughput
)
:
http://cs.anu.edu.au/~Steve.Blackburn/pubs/papers/urc-oopsla-2003.pdf
Garbage
collection
is
faster
(
more
time
efficient
)
than
reference
counting
","
if
you
have
enough
memory
.
For
example
","
a
copying
gc
traverses
the
""""
live
""""
objects
and
copies
them
to
a
new
space
","
and
can
reclaim
all
the
""""
dead
""""
objects
in
one
step
by
marking
a
whole
memory
region
.
This
is
very
efficient
","
if
you
have
enough
memory
.
Generational
collections
use
the
knowledge
that
""""
most
objects
die
young
""""
;
often
only
a
few
percent
of
objects
have
to
be
copied
.
[
This
is
also
the
reason
why
gc
can
be
faster
than
malloc
/
free
]
Reference
counting
is
much
more
space
efficient
than
garbage
collection
","
since
it
reclaims
memory
the
very
moment
it
gets
unreachable
.
This
is
nice
when
you
want
to
attach
finalizers
to
objects
(
e.g
.
to
close
a
file
once
the
File
object
gets
unreachable
)
.
A
reference
counting
system
can
work
even
when
only
a
few
percent
of
the
memory
is
free
.
But
the
management
cost
of
having
to
increment
and
decrement
counters
upon
each
pointer
assignment
cost
a
lot
of
time
","
and
some
kind
of
garbage
collection
is
still
needed
to
reclaim
cycles
.
So
the
trade-off
is
clear
:
if
you
have
to
work
in
a
memory-constrained
environment
","
or
if
you
need
precise
finalizers
","
use
reference
counting
.
If
you
have
enough
memory
and
need
the
speed
","
use
garbage
collection
.
Darren
Thomas
gives
a
good
answer
.
However
","
one
big
difference
between
the
Java
and
Python
approaches
is
that
with
reference
counting
in
the
common
case
(
no
circular
references
)
objects
are
cleaned
up
immediately
rather
than
at
some
indeterminate
later
date
.
For
example
","
I
can
write
sloppy
","
non-portable
code
in
CPython
such
as
and
the
file
descriptor
for
that
file
I
opened
will
be
cleaned
up
immediately
because
as
soon
as
the
reference
to
the
open
file
goes
away
","
the
file
is
garbage
collected
and
the
file
descriptor
is
freed
.
Of
course
","
if
I
run
Jython
or
IronPython
or
possibly
PyPy
","
then
the
garbage
collector
won't
necessarily
run
until
much
later
;
possibly
I'll
run
out
of
file
descriptors
first
and
my
program
will
crash
.
So
you
SHOULD
be
writing
code
that
looks
like
but
sometimes
people
like
to
rely
on
reference
counting
to
always
free
up
their
resources
because
it
can
sometimes
make
your
code
a
little
shorter
.
I'd
say
that
the
best
garbage
collector
is
the
one
with
the
best
performance
","
which
currently
seems
to
be
the
Java-style
generational
garbage
collectors
that
can
run
in
a
separate
thread
and
has
all
these
crazy
optimizations
","
etc.
The
differences
to
how
you
write
your
code
should
be
negligible
and
ideally
non-existent
.
Phil's
answer
really
solved
it
","
but
I'll
elaborate
a
little
more
.
Since
the
epoch
is
in
UTC
","
if
I
want
to
compare
other
times
to
the
epoch
","
I
need
to
interpret
them
as
UTC
as
well
.
By
converting
the
time
tuple
to
a
timestamp
treating
is
as
UTC
time
","
I
get
a
number
which
is
evenly
divisible
by
the
number
of
seconds
in
a
day
.
I
can
use
this
to
convert
a
date
to
a
days-from-the-epoch
representation
which
is
what
I'm
ultimately
after
.
Short
answer
:
Because
of
timezones
.
The
Epoch
is
in
UTC
.
For
example
","
I'm
on
IST
(
Irish
Standard
Time
)
or
UTC+1
.
time.mktime()
is
relative
to
my
timezone
","
so
on
my
system
this
refers
to
Because
you
got
the
result
1233378000
","
that
would
suggest
that
you're
5
hours
behind
me
Have
a
look
at
the
time.gmtime()
function
which
works
off
UTC
.
Interesting
.
I
don't
know
","
but
I
did
try
this
:
which
is
what
you
expected
.
My
guess
?
Maybe
some
time
correction
was
done
since
the
epoch
.
This
could
be
only
a
few
seconds
","
something
like
a
leap
year
.
I
think
I
heard
something
like
this
before
","
but
can't
remember
exactly
how
and
when
it
is
done
...
local
time
...
fancy
that
.
The
time
tuple
:
Incidentally
","
we
seem
to
be
6
hours
apart
:
time.mktime
should
return
the
number
of
seconds
since
the
epoch
.
Since
I'm
giving
it
a
time
at
midnight
and
the
epoch
is
at
midnight
","
shouldn't
the
result
be
evenly
divisible
by
the
number
of
seconds
in
a
day
?

","
it

it

the
field

developed
a
number
of

As
Sean

difficult
to
search

some
of
the
other

use
the

determine
how
confident
you

""""

a
very
good
article

the
Python

Apparently
","

either
UCS-2

UCS-4

on
a
compile-time
switch
.
So
Jon

your

so
what

Python
'
knows
'
that
your

Unicode

Hence
if
you
do

it

it
will
know
which

which

","
which
is
really
helpful
.
If
you
did
a

also
give
the
correct
result

As
an
example
if
you
did

count
on

you
will
get
5

even

But
if
you
did
a
string
count

a
foreign
word

that
string
was
not
a
Unicode

you
will
have
much
larger
result

what
is

Does
that
mean

Unicode

are
stored
internally

as
UCS-2
(
fixed-length

almost
the

as

.
It's
a
compile-time
option
;
on
Windows
it's
always
UTF-16
whilst
many
Linux
distributions
set
UTF-32
(
‘
wide
mode
’
)
for
their
versions
of
Python
.
You
are
generally
not
supposed

you
will
see
Unicode
code-points

your

you
won't
know
whether

four

If
you're

To
be

the

.
There
is
an
additional
source
of
confusion
stemming
from
Windows's
habit
of
using
the
term
“
Unicode
”
to
mean
","
specifically
","
the
UTF-16LE
encoding
that
NT
uses
internally
.
People
from
Microsoftland
may
often
copy
this
somewhat
misleading
habit
.
Python
stores
Unicode
as
UTF-16
.
str()
will
return
the
UTF-8
representation
of
the
UTF-16
string
.
From
Wikipedia
on
UTF-8
:
UTF-8
(
8-bit
UCS
/
Unicode
Transformation
Format
)
is
a
variable-length
character
encoding
for
Unicode
.
It
is
able
to
represent
any
character
in
the
Unicode
standard
","
yet
the
initial
encoding
of
byte
codes
and
character
assignments
for
UTF-8
is
backwards
compatible
with
ASCII
.
For
these
reasons
","
it
is
steadily
becoming
the
preferred
encoding
for
e-mail
","
web
pages
[1]
","
and
other
places
where
characters
are
stored
or
streamed
.
So
","
it's
anywhere
between
one
and
four
bytes
depending
on
which
character
you
wish
to
represent
within
the
realm
of
Unicode
.
From
Wikipedia
on
Unicode
:
In

I
stumbled
over
this
passage
in

Django
models

a

calls
unicode()

converts

UTF-8
bytestring

This
means
that
unicode(p)
will
return
a
Unicode
string
","
and
str(p)
will
return
a
normal
string

Now
","

what
is
a

So
instead
of
my
string

This
is
essentially
the
implementation
@kvance
described
30
months
ago
.
I
have
a
small
utility
that
I
use
to
download
a
MP3
from
a
website
on
a

then
builds

updates
a
podcast
XML
file

I've
obviously
added
to
iTunes
.
The
text
processing
that
creates
/
updates
the
XML
file
is
written
in
Python

I
use
wget
inside
a

bat
file

download
the
actual
MP3
however
.
I
would
prefer
to
have
the
entire
utility
written
in
Python
though

I
struggled
though
to
find
a
way
to
actually
down
load
the
file

Python

thus
why
I
resorted
to
wget
.
So
","
how
do
I
download
the
file
using
Python

urlretrieve

requests.get

not

text

","
the
above
two
probably
solve
most
of
the
tasks
.
but
for
a
more
universal
solution
I
suggest
the
use
of
urlopen
.
As
it

How
do
I
implement
some
logic
that
will
allow
me
to
reproduce
on
Windows

I

You

also
like
using
the

It
has
lot's

functionality

parallel

duplicated

but
it's
pretty
hairy
.
The
fork
call

particularly
interesting
because
it
does
not
map
well

makes
it
very
difficult

The
first
thing

the
possibility

your

a
nonlinear

You

difficulty

keep
a

commit

the

lines

code

that
commit

work
backwards

until
all
paths
reach
a
commit

you've
already
seen
before

That
should
give
you
the
total
lines

code
for
each
commit
id
.
Does
that
help
any
?
I
have
a
feeling
that
I've
misunderstood
something
about
your
question
.
Basically
I
want
to
get
the
number
of
lines-of-code
in
the
repository
after
each
commit
.
The
only
(
really
crappy

ways
I
have
found
is
to
use
git
filter-branch

run
wc

a
script

runs
git

this

So
vectorizing

Just
use
the

again

many

If
I'm
not

the

it

.
All
passwords
need
to
be
32
bytes
at
the
start
of
computing
the
encryption
key
","
either
by
truncating
or
adding
some
of
those
padding
bytes
.
If
no
user
password
was
set
you
simply
have
to
pad
with
all
32
bytes
of
the
string
","
i.e.
use
the
32
padding
bytes
as
the
starting
point
for
computing
the
encryption
key
.
I
have
to
admit
it's
been
a
while
since
I've
done
this
","
I
do
remember
that
the
encryption
part
of
the
PDF
is
an
absolute
mess
as
it
got
changed
significantly
in
nearly
every
revision
","
requiring
you
to
cope
with
a
lot
of
cases
to
handle
all
PDF's
.
Good
luck
.
Although
the
PDF
specification
is
available
from
Adobe
","
it's
not
exactly
the
simplest
document
to
read
through
.
PDF
allows
documents
to
be
encrypted
so
that
either
a
user
password
and
/
or
an
owner
password
is
required
to
do
various
things
with
the
document
(
display
","
print
","
etc
)
.
A
common
use
is
to
lock
a
PDF
so
that
end
users
can
read
it
without
entering
any
password
","
but
a
password
is
required
to
do
anything
else
.
I'm
trying
to
parse
PDFs
that
are
locked
in
this
way
(
to
get
the
same
privileges
as
you
would
get
opening
them
in
any
reader
)
.
Using
an
empty
string
as
the
user
password
doesn't
work
","
but
it
seems
(
section
3.5.2
of
the
spec
)
that
there
has
to
be
a
user
password
to
create
the
hash
for
the
admin
password
.
What
I
would
like
is
either
an
explanation
of
how
to
do
this
","
or
any
code
that
I
can
read
(
ideally
Python
","
C
","
or
C
+
+
","
but
anything
readable
will
do
)
that
does
this
so
that
I
can
understand
what
I'm
meant
to
be
doing
.
Standalone
code
","
rather
than
reading
through
(
e.g
.
)
the
gsview
source
","
would
be
best
.
xpdf
is
probably
a
good
reference
implementation
for
this
sort
of
problem
.
I
have
successfully
used
them
to
open
encrypted
pdfs
before
.
List
comprehensions
.
I
often
find
myself
filtering
/
mapping
lists
","
and
being
able
to
say
[
"line.replace(""spam"",""eggs"")"
for
line
in
"open(""somefile.txt"")"
if
"line.startswith(""nee"")"
]
is
really
nice
.
Functions
are
first
class
objects
.
They
can
be
passed
as
parameters
to
other
functions
","
defined
inside
other
function
","
and
have
lexical
scope
.
This
makes
it
really
easy
to
say
things
like
people.sort(key=lambda p: p.age)
and
thus
sort
a
bunch
of
people
on
their
age
without
having
to
define
a
custom
comparator
class
or
something
equally
verbose
.
Everything
is
an
object
.
Java
has
basic
types
which
aren't
objects
","
which
is
why
many
classes
in
the
standard
library
define
9
different
versions
of
functions
(
for
boolean
","
byte
","
char
","
double
","
float
","
int
","
long
","
Object
","
short
)
.
Array.sort
is
a
good
example
.
Autoboxing
helps
","
although
it
makes
things
awkward
when
something
turns
out
to
be
null
.
Properties
.
Python
lets
you
create
classes
with
read-only
fields
","
lazily-generated
fields
","
as
well
as
fields
which
are
checked
upon
assignment
to
make
sure
they're
never
0
or
null
or
whatever
you
want
to
guard
against
","
etc.
'
Default
and
keyword
arguments
.
In
Java
if
you
want
a
constructor
that
can
take
up
to
5
optional
arguments
","
you
must
define
6
different
versions
of
that
constructor
.
And
there's
no
way
at
all
to
say
"Student(name=""Eli"", age=25)"
Functions
can
only
return
1
thing
.
In
Python
you
have
tuple
assignment
","
so
you
can
say
spam
","
eggs
=
nee()
but
in
Java
you'd
need
to
either
resort
to
mutable
out
parameters
or
have
a
custom
class
with
2
fields
and
then
have
two
additional
lines
of
code
to
extract
those
fields
.
Built-in
syntax
for
lists
and
dictionaries
.
Operator
Overloading
.
Generally
better
designed
libraries
.
For
example
","
to
parse
an
XML
document
in
Java
","
you
say
Document
doc
=
DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance()
.
newDocumentBuilder()
.
"parse(""test.xml"")"
;
and
in
Python
you
say
doc
=
"parse(""test.xml"")"
Anyway
","
I
could
go
on
and
on
with
further
examples
","
but
Python
is
just
overall
a
much
more
flexible
and
expressive
language
.
It's
also
dynamically
typed
","
which
I
really
like
","
but
which
comes
with
some
disadvantages
.
Java
has
much
better
performance
than
Python
and
has
way
better
tool
support
.
Sometimes
those
things
matter
a
lot
and
Java
is
the
better
language
than
Python
for
a
task
;
I
continue
to
use
Java
for
some
new
projects
despite
liking
Python
a
lot
more
.
But
as
a
language
I
think
Python
is
superior
for
most
things
I
find
myself
needing
to
accomplish
.
I
think
this
pair
of
articles
by
Philip
J
.
Eby
does
a
great
job
discussing
the
differences
between
the
two
languages
(
mostly
about
philosophy
/
mentality
rather
than
specific
language
features
)
.
Python
is
Not
Java
Java
is
Not
Python
","
either
With
Jython
you
can
have
both
.
It's
only
at
Python
2.2
","
but
still
very
useful
if
you
need
an
embedded
interpreter
that
has
access
to
the
Java
runtime
.
One
key
difference
in
Python
is
significant
whitespace
.
This
puts
a
lot
of
people
off
-
me
too
for
a
long
time
-
but
once
you
get
going
it
seems
natural
and
makes
much
more
sense
than
;
s
everywhere
.
From
a
personal
perspective
","
Python
has
the
following
benefits
over
Java
:
No
Checked
Exceptions
Optional
Arguments
Much
less
boilerplate
and
less
verbose
generally
Other
than
those
","
this
page
on
the
Python
Wiki
is
a
good
place
to
look
with
lots
of
links
to
interesting
articles
.
Besides
the
dynamic
nature
of
Python
(
and
the
syntax
)
","
what
are
some
of
the
major
features
of
the
Python
language
that
Java
doesn't
have
","
and
vice
versa
?
Apart
from
what
Eli
Courtwright
said
:
I
find
iterators
in
Python
more
concise
.
You
can
use
for
i
in
something
","
and
it
works
with
pretty
much
everything
.
Yeah
","
Java
has
gotten
better
since
1.5
","
but
for
example
you
can
iterate
through
a
string
in
python
with
this
same
construct
.
Introspection
:
In
python
you
can
get
at
runtime
information
about
an
object
or
a
module
about
its
symbols
","
methods
","
or
even
its
docstrings
.
You
can
also
instantiate
them
dynamically
.
Java
has
some
of
this
","
but
usually
in
Java
it
takes
half
a
page
of
code
to
get
an
instance
of
a
class
","
whereas
in
Python
it
is
about
3
lines
.
And
as
far
as
I
know
the
docstrings
thing
is
not
available
in
Java
The
open
source
Python
package
","
SciPy
","
has
quite
a
large
set
of
optimization
routines
including
some
for
multivariable
problems
with
constraints
(
which
is
what
fmincon
does
I
believe
)
.
Once
you
have
SciPy
installed
type
the
following
at
the
Python
command
prompt
help(scipy.optimize)
The
resulting
document

the
following

I

might
be
of
use
to
you
.
Is
your
problem
convex
?
Linear
?
Non-linear
?
I
agree
that
SciPy.optimize
will
probably
do
the
job
","
but
fmincon
is
a
sort
of
bazooka
for
solving
optimization
problems
","

you'll
be
better
off

you

The

great
use

you

you

Many

some

There's
nothing
wrong
with
using
a

line
utility

do
what
you
want

you
put
a

you
can

you

sometimes

them

an
intermediate
web
service

others

I
was
doing
To
get

of
executing

others
have
said
.
You
may
also
want
to
use
:
this
would
print
the
path
of
the
currently
executing
script
I
think
this
is
cleaner
:
and
gets
the
same
information
as
:
Where
[0]
is
the
current
frame
in
the
stack
(
top
of
stack
)
and
[1]
is
for
the
file
name
","
increase
to
go
backwards
in
the
stack
i.e.
would
be
the
file
name
of
the
script
that
called
the
current
frame
.
Also
","
using
[
-
1
]
will
get
you
to
the
bottom
of
the
stack
","
the
original
calling
script
.
The
suggestions
marked
as
best
are
all
true
if
your
script
consists
of
only
one
file
.
If
you
want
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
executable
(
i.e.
the
root
file
passed
to
the
python
interpreter
for
the
current
program
)
from
a
file
that
may
be
imported
as
a
module
","
you
need
to
do
this
(
let's
assume
this
is
in
a
file
named
foo.py
)
:
import inspect
print
inspect.stack()
[
-
1
]
[1]
Because
the
last
thing
(
[
-
1
]
)
on
the
stack
is
the
first
thing
that
went
into
it
(
stacks
are
LIFO
/
FILO
data
structures
)
.
Then
in
file
bar.py
if
you
import foo
it'll
print
bar.py
","
rather
than
foo.py
","
which
would
be
the
value
of
all
of
these
:
__file__
inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe()
)
inspect.stack()
[0]
[1]
I
used
the
approach
with
__file__
os.path.abspath(__file__)
but
there
is
a
little
trick
","
it
returns
the
.
py
file
when
the
code
is
run
the
first
time
","
next
runs
give
the
name
of
*
.
pyc
file
so
I
stayed
with
:
inspect.getfile(inspect.currentframe()
)
or
sys._getframe()
.
f_code.co_filename
I
wrote
a
function
which
take
into
account
eclipse
debugger
and
unittest
.
It
return
the
folder
of
the
first
script
you
launch
.
You
can
optionally
specify
the
__file__
var
","
but
the
main
thing
is
that
you
don't
have
to
share
this
variable
across
all
your
calling
hierarchy
.
Maybe
you
can
handle
others
stack
particular
cases
I
didn't
see
","
but
for
me
it's
ok
.
if
you
want
just
the
filename
without
.
/
or
.
py
you
can
try
this
file_name
will
print
testscript
you
can
generate
whatever
you
want
by
changing
the
index
inside
[]
I
have
a
script
that
must
work
under
windows
environment
.
This
code
snipped
is
what
I've
finished
with
:
it's
quite
a
hacky
decision
.
But
it
requires
no
external
libraries
and
it's
the
most
important
thing
in
my
case
.
this
will
give
us
the
filename
only
.
i.e.
if
abspath
of
file
is
c:\abcd\abc.py
then
2nd
line
will
print
abc.py
No
need
for
inspect
or
any
other
library
.
This
worked
for
me
when
I
had
to
import a
script
(
from
a
different
directory
then
the
executed
script
)
","
that
used
a
configuration
file
residing
in
the
same
folder
as
the
imported
script
.
It's
not
entirely
clear
what
you
mean
by
""""
the
filepath
of
the
file

is
currently
running
within
the
process
""""
.
sys.argv
[0]
usually
contains
the
location
of
the
script
that
was
invoked
by
the
Python
interpreter
.
Check
the
sys
documentation
for
more
details
.
As
@Tim
and
@Pat
Notz
have
pointed
out
","
the
__file__
attribute
provides
access
to
the
file
from
which
the
module
was
loaded
","
if
it
was
loaded
from
a
file
I
think
it's
just
__file__
Sounds
like
you
may
also
want
to
checkout
the
inspect
module
.
The
__file__
attribute
works
for
both
the
file
containing
the
main
execution
code
as
well
as

the

system

but
the
default
database
backend
is
the
best
","
safest
and
simplest
option
in
almost
all
cases
.
I'm
looking
at
sessions
in
Django
","
and
by
default
they
are
stored
in
the
database
.
What
are
the
benefits
of
filesystem
and
cache
sessions
and
when
should
I
use
them
?
I'm
no
Django
expert
","
so
this
answer
is
about
session
stores
generally
.
Downvote
if
I'm
wrong
.
Performance
and
Scalability
Choice
of
session
store
has
an
effect
on
performance
and
scalability
.
This
should
only
be
a
big
problem
if
you
have
a
very
popular
application
.
Both
database
and
filesystem
session
stores
are
(
usually
)
backed
by
disks
so
you
can
have
a
lot
of
sessions
cheaply
(
because
disks
are
cheap
)
","
but
requests
will
often
have
to
wait
for
the
data
to
be
read
(
because
disks
are
slow
)
.
Memcached
sessions
use
RAM
","
so
will
cost
more
to
support
the
same
number
of
concurrent
sessions
(
because
RAM
is
expensive
)
","
but
may
be
faster
(
because
RAM
is
fast
)
.
Filesystem
sessions
are
tied
to
the
box
where
your
application
is
running
","
so
you
can't
load
balance
between
multiple
application
servers
if
your
site
gets
huge
.
Database
and
memcached
sessions
let
you
have
multiple
application
servers
talking
to
a
shared
session
store
.
Simplicity
Choice
of
session
store
will
also
impact
how
easy
it
is
to
deploy
your
site
.
Changing
away
from
the
default
will
cost
some
complexity
.
Memcached
and
RDBMSs
both
have
their
own
complexities
","
but
your
application
is
probably
going
to
be
using
an
RDBMS
anyway
.
Unless
you
have
a
very
popular
application
","
simplicity
should
be
the
larger
concern
.
Bonus
Another
approach
is
to
store
session
data
in
cookies
(
all
of
it
","
not
just
an
ID
)
.
This
has
the
advantage
that
the
session
store
automatically
scales
with
the
number
of
users
","
but
it
has
disadvantages
too
.
You
(
or
your
framework
)
need
to
be
careful
to
stop
users
forging
session
data
.
You
also
need
to
keep
each
session
small
because
the
whole
thing
will
be
sent
with
every
request
.
If
the
database
have
a
DBA
that
isn't
you
","
you
may
not
be
allowed
to
use
a
database-backed
session
(
it
being
a
front-end
matter
only
)
.
Until
django
supports
easily
merging
data
from
several
databases
","
so
that
you
can
have
frontend-specific
stuff
like
sessions
and
user-messages
(
the
messages
in
django.contrib.auth
are
also
stored
in
the
db
)
in
a
separate
db
","
you
need
to
keep
this
in
mind
.
As
of
Django
1.1
you
can
use
the
cached_db
session
back
end
.
This
stores
the
session
in
the
cache
(
only
use
with
memcached
)
","
and
writes
it
back
to
the
DB
.
If
it
has
fallen
out
of
the
cache
","
it
will
be
read
from
the
DB
.
Although
this
is
slower
than
just
using
memcached
for
storing
the
session
","
it
adds
persistence
to
the
session
.

Cached
Sessions

You
can
also
use
weakref.proxy
to
create
an
object
that

Python

Retrieve
the

then
do
the

It
seems
that
this

","
since
there
wouldn't
be
a
good
way
to
deal
with
overflows
in
datetime.time
.
I
know
this
isn't
an
answer
directly
","
but
maybe
someone
with
more
python
experience
than
me
can
take
this
a
little
further

I
have
2
time
values
which
have
the
type
datetime.time
.
I
want
to
find
their
difference
.
The
obvious
thing
to
do
is
t1
-
t2
","
but
this
doesn't
work
.
It
works
for
objects
of
type
datetime.datetime
but
not
for
datetime.time
.
So
what
is
the
best
way
to
do
this
?
You
could
transform
both
into
timedelta
objects
and
subtract
these
from
each
other
","
which
will
take
care
to
of
the
carry-overs
.
For
example
:
Negative
timedelta
objects
in
Python
get
a
negative
day
field
","
with
the
other
fields
positive
.
You
could
check
beforehand
:
comparison
works
on
both
time
objects
and
timedelta
objects
:
Firstly
","
note
that
a
datetime.time
is
a
time
of
day
","
independent
of
a
given
day
","
and
so
the
different
between
any
two
datetime.time
values
is
going
to
be
less
than
24
hours
.
One
approach
is
to
convert
both
datetime.time
values
into
comparable
values
(
such
as
milliseconds
)
","
and
find
the
difference
.
It's
a
little
lame
","
but
it
works
.
Also
a
little
silly
","
but
you
could
try
picking
an
arbitrary
day
and
embedding
each
time
in
it
","
using
datetime.datetime.combine
","
then
subtracting
:
Environment.TickCount
seems
to
work
well
if
you
need
something
quick

There's
a
text
progress
bar
library
for
python
at
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2
that
you
might
find
useful
:
This
library
provides
a
text
mode
progressbar
.
This
is
tipically
used
to
display
the
progress
of
a
long
running
operation
","
providing
a
visual
clue
that
processing
is
underway
.
The
ProgressBar
class
manages
the
progress
","
and
the
format
of
the
line
is
given
by
a
number
of
widgets
.
A
widget
is
an
object
that
may
display
diferently
depending
on
the
state
of
the
progress
.
There
are
three
types
of
widget
:
-
a
string
","
which
always
shows
itself
;
-
a
ProgressBarWidget
","
which
may
return
a
diferent
value
every
time
it's
update
method
is
called
;
and
-
a
ProgressBarWidgetHFill
","
which
is
like
ProgressBarWidget
","
except
it
expands
to
fill
the
remaining
width
of
the
line
.
The
progressbar
module
is
very
easy
to
use
","
yet
very
powerful
.
And
automatically
supports
features
like
auto-resizing
when
available
.
You
might
also
try
:
Using
a
single
carriage
return
at
the
beginning
of
your
string
rather
than
several
backspaces
.
Your
cursor
will
still
blink
","
but
it'll
blink
after
the
percent
sign
rather
than
under
the
first
digit
","
and
with
one
control
character
instead
of
three
you
may
get
less
flicker
.
For
small
files
you
may
need
to
had
this
lines
in
order
to
avoid
crazy
percentages
:
"sys.stdout.write(""\r%2d%%"" % percent)"
sys.stdout.flush()

Thats
how
I
did

help
you

what
it's
worth

here's
the
code
I
used
to
get
it
working

If
you
use
the
curses
package
","
you
have
much
greater
control
of
the
console
.
It
also
comes
at
a
higher
cost
in
code
complexity
and
is
probably
unnecessary
unless
you
are
developing
a
large
console-based
app
.
For
a
simple
solution
","
you
can
always
put
the
spinning
wheel

the
status
messge

the
sequence
of
characters
|
","
\
","
-
","
/
which
actually
looks
nice
under
blinking
cursor
.
I
used
this
code
:
Late
to
the
party
","
as
usual
.
Here's
an
implementation
that
supports
reporting
progress
","
like
the
core
urlretrieve
:
I
am
writing
a
little
application
to
download
files
over
http
(
as
","
for
example
","
described
here
)
.
I
also
want
to
include
a
little
download
progress
indicator
showing
the
percentage
of
the
download
progress
.
Here
is
what
I
came
up
with
:
"sys.stdout.write(rem_file + ""..."")"
"urllib.urlretrieve(rem_file, loc_file, reporthook=dlProgress)"
"def dlProgress(count, blockSize, totalSize):"
percent
=
int(count*blockSize*100/totalSize)
"sys.stdout.write(""%2d%%"" % percent)"
"sys.stdout.write(""\b\b\b"")"
sys.stdout.flush()
Output
:
MyFileName
...
9
%
Any
other
ideas
or
recommendations
to
do
this
?
One
thing
that's
somewhat
annoying
is
the
blinking
cursor
in
the
terminal
on
the
first
digit
of
the
percentage
.
Is
there
a
way
to
prevent
this
?
Is
there
a
way

EDIT
:
Here
a
better
alternative
using
a
global
variable
for
the
filename
in

the

percent

"sys.stdout.write(""\r"" + rem_file + ""...%d%%"" % percent)"
sys.stdout.flush()
Output
:
MyFileName...9
%
And
the
cursor
shows
up
at
the
END
of
the
line
.
Much
better
.
soup.title.string

such
a

but
if
you
plan

then
it's
saner
to
start

an
aside

you

to
decipher

I
stare
at
it

I

doing

The
problem
occurs
at
the
end

that
if
block

all
the
tabbing

then
suddenly
returning
to
a
jarring
block

almost
disturbing

As
a

I've
started
coding
my
Python

this

And
this
","
for
some
odd
reason

makes
me
more
able
to
read
my
own
code

But
I'm
curious
:
has
anyone
else
with
my
strange
problem
found
easier
ways
to
make
their
tabbed-out
code
more
readable

I'd
love
to
find
out
if
there's
a
better
way
to
do
this
before
this
becomes
a
huge
habit
for
me

You
could
try
increasing
the
indent
size

but
in
general
I
would
just
say
","
relax
","
it
will
come
with
time

I
don't
think
trying
to
make
Python
look
like
C

a
very
good
idea

I
would
look
in
to
understanding
more
details
about
Python
syntax

Often
times

a
piece

code
looks
odd
","
there
usually
is
a
better
way

write
it

the
above
example

it

small
change

the
readability

Also
","
in
all
honesty
","
I've
never
used
a
while
loop
","

there

up

Part
of
learning
a
new
programming
language
is
learning
to
read
code
in
that
language

A
crutch
like
this
may
make
it
easier
to
read
your
own

it's
going
to
impede
the
process
of
learning
how
to
read
anyone
else's
Python
code

I
really
think
you'd
be
better
off
getting
rid
of
the
end
of
block
comments

getting
used
to
normal
Python
.
Rather
than
focusing
on
making
your
existing
structures
more
readable
","
you
should
focus
on
making
more
logical
structures

Make
smaller
blocks
","
try
not
to
nest
blocks
excessively
","
make
smaller
functions
","
and
try
to
think
through
your
code
flow
more
.
If
you
come
to
a
point
where
you
can't
quickly
determine
the
structure
of
your
code
","
you
should
probably
consider
refactoring
and
adding
some
comments
.
Code
flow
should
always
be
immediately
apparent
-
-
the
more
you
have
to
think
about
it
","
the
less
maintainable
your
code
becomes
.
I
like
to
put
blank
lines
around
blocks
to
make
control
flow
more
obvious

For
example
:
Perhaps
the
best
thing
would
be
to
turn
on
""""
show
whitespace
""""

your
editor
.
Then
you
would
have
a
visual
indication
of
how
far
in
each
line
is
tabbed
(
usually
a
bunch
of
dots
)
","
and
it
will
be
more
apparent
when
that
changes

Better
still

the
path.py
module

wraps
all
the

I
might
end
up
with

I
don't
think

your
results

all
that
surprising
-
-
if
anything
it

that
Postgres

fast

Does
the
Postgres
query
run
faster
a
second
time
once
it
has
had
a
chance
to
cache
the
data
?
To
be
a
little
fairer
your
test
for
Java
and
Python
should
cover
the
cost
of
acquiring
the
data
in
the
first
place
(
ideally
loading
it
off
disk
)

If
this
performance
level
is
a
problem
for
your
application
in
practice
but
you
need
a
RDBMS
for
other
reasons

you
could
look
at
memcached

You
would
then
have
faster
cached
access

raw
data

could
do
the
calculations
in
code

I
need
a
real
DBA's
opinion

Postgres
8.3
takes
200
ms
to
execute
this
query
on
my
Macbook
Pro

Java

Python
perform
the

Is
this
normal
behaviour
when
using
a
SQL

The
schema

the

responses

I
wrote
some
tests

Python

they
crush
SQL

for
pure
python
)
:
Even
sqlite3
is
competitive
with
Postgres
despite
it
assumping
all
columns
are
strings
(
for
contrast
:
even
using
just
switching
to
numeric
columns
instead
of
integers

Postgres
results
in
10x
slowdown

Tunings

tried
without
success

some

So
my
question
is
","

my
experience
here
normal
","
and
this
is
what
I
can
expect
when
using
a
SQL
database
?
I
can
understand
that
ACID
must
come
with
costs
","
but
this
is
kind
of
crazy
in
my
opinion
.
I'm
not
asking
for
realtime
game
speed
","
but
since
Java
can
process
millions
of
doubles
in
under
20
ms
","
I
feel
a
bit
jealous
.
Is
there
a
better
way
to
do
simple
OLAP
on
the
cheap
(
both
in
terms
of
money
and
server
complexity
)
?
I've
looked
into
Mondrian
and
Pig
+
Hadoop
but
not
super
excited
about
maintaining
yet
another
server
application
and
not
sure
if
they
would
even
help
.
No
the
Python
code
and
Java
code
do
all
the
work
in
house
so
to
speak
.
I
just
generate
4
arrays
with
350
","
000
random
values
each
","
then
take
the
average
.
I
don't
include
the
generation
in
the
timings
","
only
the
averaging
step
.
The
java
threads
timing
uses
4
threads
(
one
per
array
average
)
","
overkill
but
it's
definitely
the
fastest
.
The
sqlite3
timing
is
driven
by
the
Python
program
and
is
running
from
disk
(
not
:
memory
:
)
I
realize
Postgres
is
doing
much
more
behind
the
scenes
","
but
most
of
that
work
doesn't
matter
to
me
since
this
is
read
only
data
.
The
Postgres
query
doesn't
change
timing
on
subsequent
runs
.
I've
rerun
the
Python
tests
to
include
spooling
it
off
the
disk
.
The
timing
slows
down
considerably
to
nearly
4
secs
.
But
I'm
guessing
that
Python's
file
handling
code
is
pretty
much
in
C
(
though
maybe
not
the
csv
lib
?
)
so
this
indicates
to
me
that
Postgres
isn't
streaming
from
the
disk
either
(
or
that
you
are
correct
and
I
should
bow
down
before
whoever
wrote
their
storage
layer
!
)
Postgres
is
doing
a
lot
more
than
it
looks
like
(
maintaining
data
consistency
for
a
start
!
)
If
the
values
don't
have
to
be
100
%
spot
on
","
or
if
the
table
is
updated
rarely
","
but
you
are
running
this
calculation
often
","
you
might
want
to
look
into
Materialized
Views
to
speed
it
up
.
(
Note
","
I
have
not
used
materialized
views

","
they
look
at
little
hacky
","
but
might
suite
your
situation
)
.
Materialized
Views
Also
consider
the
overhead
of
actually
connecting
to
the
server
and
the
round
trip
required
to
send
the
request
to
the
server
and
back
.
I'd
consider
200ms
for
something
like
this
to
be
pretty
good
","
A
quick
test
on
my
oracle
server
","
the
same
table
structure
with
about
500k
rows
and
no
indexes
","
takes
about
1
-
1.5
seconds
","
which
is
almost
all
just
oracle
sucking
the
data
off
disk
.
The
real
question
is
","
is
200ms
fast
enough

I

interested

solving
this

never
really
played

This
is
in

First
I
created
a
MV
which
refreshes
every
minute
.
While
its
refreshing
","
there
is
no
rows
returned
Once
it
refreshes
","
its
MUCH
faster

doing
the
raw
query
If
we
insert
into
the
base
table
","
the
result
is
not
immediately
viewable

the
MV

But
wait
a
minute
or
so
","
and
the
MV
will
update
behind
the
scenes
","
and
the
result
is
returned
fast
as
you
could
want
.
This
isn't
ideal
.
for
a
start
","
its
not
realtime
","
inserts
/
updates
will
not
be
immediately
visible

Also
","
you've
got
a
query
running
to
update
the
MV
whether
you
need
it

not
(
this
can
be
tune
to
whatever
time
frame
","
or
on
demand
)
.
But
","
this
does
show
how
much
faster
an
MV
can
make
it
seem
to
the
end
user
","
if
you
can
live
with
values
which
aren't
quite
upto
the
second
accurate
.
I'm
a
MS-SQL
guy
myself
","
and
we'd
use
DBCC
PINTABLE
to
keep
a
table
cached
","
and
SET
STATISTICS
IO
to
see
that
it's
reading
from
cache

not
disk

I
can't
find
anything
on
Postgres

mimic
PINTABLE
","

pg_buffercache
seems
to
give
details

you
may
want
to
check
that

see

your
table

actually
being
cached

A
quick
back
of
the
envelope
calculation
makes
me
suspect
that
you're
paging
from

you

8.4MB

pointed
out

be
where
almost
all

spent

Unless

screwed
up
my
math
somewhere
","
I
don't
see
how
it's
possible
that
you
are
able
to
read
8MB

your
Java
app

process
it

showing

that

already
cached

retested

it

change
a
thing

still

totally
unfair
comparison
if
Postgres
is
reading
from
the
disk
and
calculating
a
complicated
query
","
but
that's
really
besides
the
point
","
the
DB
should
be
smart
enough
to
bring
a
small
table
into
memory

precompile
a
stored
procedure
IMHO
.
UPDATE
(
in
response
to
the
first
comment
below
)
:
I'm
not
sure
how
I'd
test
the
query
without
using
an
aggregation
function
in
a
way
that
would
be
fair
","
since
if
i
select
all
of
the
rows
it'll
spend
tons
of
time
serializing
and
formatting
everything
.
I'm
not
saying
that
the
slowness
is
due
to
the
aggregation
function
","
it
could
still
be
just
overhead
from
concurrency
","
integrity
","
and
friends
.
I
just
don't
know
how
to
isolate
the
aggregation
as
the
sole
independent
variable
.
You
need
to
increase
postgres
'
caches
to
the
point
where
the
whole
working
set
fits
into
memory
before
you
can
expect
to
see
perfomance
comparable
to
doing
it
in-memory
with
a
program
.
Those
are
very
detailed
answers
","
but
they
mostly
beg
the
question
","
how
do
I
get
these
benefits
without
leaving
Postgres
given
that
the
data
easily
fits
into
memory
","
requires
concurrent
reads
but
no
writes
and
is
queried
with
the
same
query
over
and
over
again
.
Is
it
possible
to
precompile
the
query
and
optimization
plan
?
I
would
have
thought
the
stored
procedure
would
do
this
","
but
it
doesn't
really
help
.
To
avoid
disk
access
it's
necessary
to
cache
the
whole
table
in
memory
","
can
I
force
Postgres
to
do
that
?
I
think
it's
already
doing
this
though
","
since
the
query
executes
in
just
200
ms
after
repeated
runs
.
Can
I
tell
Postgres
that
the
table
is
read
only
","
so
it
can
optimize
any
locking
code
?
I
think
it's
possible
to
estimate
the
query
construction
costs
with
an
empty
table
(
timings
range
from
20-60
ms
)
I
still
can't
see
why
the
Java
/
Python
tests
are
invalid
.
Postgres
just
isn't
doing
that
much
more
work
(
though
I
still
haven't
addressed
the
concurrency
aspect

just
the
caching
and
query
construction

UPDATE
:
I
don't
think
it's
fair
to
compare
the
SELECTS
as
suggested
by
pulling
350
","
000
through
the
driver
and
serialization
steps
into
Python
to
run
the
aggregation
","
nor
even
to
omit
the
aggregation
as
the
overhead
in
formatting
and
displaying
is
hard
to
separate
from
the
timing
.
If
both
engines
are
operating
on
in

data
","
it
should
be
an
apples

I'm
not
sure
how

guarantee
that's
already
happening

can't
figure
out
how
to
add
comments

i
don't

I
would
say
your
test
scheme
is
not
really
useful
.
To
fulfill
the
db
query
","
the
db

through
several
steps

an
index

it

then
go
to
the
appropriate
location

a
major
flaw
in
the
test
(
see
also
the
answers

this
question
I
asked
here
before

.
Even
if
you
read
the

other

the
process

completely
different

tell

relevant

.
To
obtain
more
information
about
where
Postgres
spends
its
time
","
I
would
suggest
the
following
tests
:
Compare
the
execution
time
of
your
query
to
a
SELECT
without
the
aggregating
functions
(
i
.
e
.
cut
step
5
)
If
you
find
that
the
aggregation
leads
to
a
significant
slowdown
","
try
if
Python
does
it
faster
","
obtaining
the
raw
data
through
the
plain
SELECT
from
the
comparison
.
To
speed
up
your
query
","
reduce
disk
access
first
.
I
doubt
very
much
that
it's
the
aggregation
that
takes
the
time
.
There's
several
ways
to
do
that
:
Cache
data
(
in
memory
!
)
for
subsequent
access
","
either
via
the
db
engine's
own
capabilities
or
with
tools
like
memcached
Reduce
the
size
of
your
stored
data
Optimize
the
use
of
indices
.
Sometimes
this
can
mean
to
skip
index
use
altogether
(
after
all
","
it's
disk
access
","
too
)
.
For
MySQL
","
I
seem
to
remember
that
it's
recommended
to
skip
indices
if
you
assume
that
the
query
fetches
more
than
10
%
of
all
the
data
in
the
table
.
If
your
query
makes
good
use
of
indices
","
I
know
that
for
MySQL
databases
it
helps
to
put
indices
and
data
on
separate
physical
disks
.
However
","
I
don't
know
whether
that's
applicable
for
Postgres
.
There
also
might
be
more
sophisticated
problems
such
as
swapping
rows
to
disk
if
for
some
reason
the
result
set
can't
be
completely
processed
in
memory
.
But
I
would
leave
that
kind
of
research
until
I
run
into
serious
performance
problems
that
I
can't
find
another
way
to
fix
","
as
it
requires
knowledge
about
a
lot
of
little
under-the-hood
details
in
your
process
.
Update
:
I
just
realized
that
you
seem
to
have
no
use
for
indices
for
the
above
query
and
most
likely
aren't
using
any
","
too
","
so
my
advice
on
indices
probably
wasn't
helpful
.
Sorry
.
Still
","
I'd
say
that
the
aggregation
is
not
the
problem
but
disk
access
is
.
I'll
leave
the
index
stuff
in
","
anyway
","
it
might
still
have
some
use
.
Are
you
using
TCP

access

Thanks
for
the
Oracle

that's
the
kind
of
stuff
I'm
looking
for
(
disappointing
though
:
-
)
Materialized
views
are
probably
worth
considering
as
I
think
I
can
precompute
the
most
interesting
forms
of
this
query
for
most
users
.
I
don't
think
query
round
trip
time
should
be
very
high
as
i'm
running
the
the
queries
on
the
same
machine
that
runs
Postgres
","
so
it
can't
add
much
latency
?
I've
also
done
some
checking
into
the
cache
sizes
","
and
it
seems
Postgres
relies
on
the
OS
to
handle
caching
","
they
specifically
mention
BSD
as
the
ideal
OS
for
this
","
so
I
thinking
Mac
OS
ought
to
be
pretty
smart
about
bringing
the
table
into
memory
.
Unless
someone
has
more
specific
params
in
mind
I
think
more
specific
caching
is
out
of
my
control
.
In
the
end
I
can
probably
put
up
with
200
ms
response
times
","
but
knowing
that
7
ms
is
a
possible
target
makes
me
feel
unsatisfied
","
as
even
20-50
ms
times
would
enable
more
users
to
have
more
up
to
date
queries
and
get
rid
of
a
lots
of
caching
and
precomputed
hacks
.
I
just
checked
the
timings
using
MySQL
5
and
they
are
slightly
worse
than
Postgres
.
So
barring
some
major
caching
breakthroughs
","
I
guess
this
is
what
I
can
expect
going
the
relational
db

I
wish
I

up

enough
points

One
other
thing
that
an
RDBMS
generally
does
for
you
is
to
provide
concurrency

protecting
you
from
simultaneous
access
by
another
process

This
is
done
by
placing
locks

there's
some
overhead
from
that
.
If
you're
dealing
with

static
data

""""

you

I
used

it

very
straightforward

http://home.gna.org/pychart/
It's
all
native
python

does
not
have
a
busload

I'm
sure
matplotlib

lovely

I'd
be
downloading

installing
for
days

I
just
want
one
measley

It
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
updated

a
few
years

hey
it
works
!
You
didn't
mention
what

you
need

reportlab
is
good
at
creating

If

you
should
consider
Gnuplot.py

also

Unfortunately
","
it
is
no
longer
being
actively

I
don't
think
that's
possible
.
It
would
be
relatively
easy
to
add
this
functionality
to
the
underlying
C
+
+
wxWidgets
control
","
but
since
you're
using
wxPython
","
you'd
then
have
to
rebuild
that
as
well
which
is
a
tremendous
issue
.
Listing

walking
directories
in

is
very
easy

so
I
would
recommend
trying

""""

using
one
of
the
simple
tree

such

It
should
really
be
quite
easy
to
call
the
directory
listing
code
when
some
directory
is
expanded
and
return
the
result
.
I
am
using
a
wxGenericDirCtrl
","
and
I
would
like
to
know
if
there
is
a
way
to
hide
directories
","
I'd
especially
like
to
hide
siblings
of
parent
nodes
.
For
example
if
my
directory
structure
looks
like
this
:
If
my
currently
selected
directory
is
/
a
/
c
/
d
is
there
any
way
to
hide
b
and
g
","
so
that
the
tree
looks
like
this
in
my
ctrl
:
I'm
currently
working
with
a
directory
structure
that
has
lots
and
lots
directories
that
are
irrelevant
to
most
users
","
so
it
would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
clean
it
up
.
Edit
:
If
it
makes
a
difference
","
I
am
using

far
","
I
have
only
tested

a

Something

you
are
left

What
I
changed
:
Used
a
list
comprehension
to
build
the
data
instead
of
a
for
loop
Used
random.randint
to
get
random
integers
Used
slices

sum
to
calculate
the
average
of
the
first
three
items

To
answer
your
actual
question
:

)
Put
the
results
in
a
list
mcworks
","
instead
of
creating
a
new
variable
for
every
iteration
I
am
writing
a
program
to
simulate
the
actual
polling
data
companies
like
Gallup
or
Rasmussen
publish
daily
:
www.gallup.com
and
www.rassmussenreports.com
I'm
using
a
brute
force
method
","
where
the
computer
generates
some
random
daily
polling
data
and
then
calculates
three
day
averages
to
see
if
the
average
of
the
random
data
matches
pollsters
numbers
.
(
Most
companies
poll
numbers
are
three
day
averages
)
Currently
","
it
works
well
for
one
iteration
","
but
my
goal
is
to
have
it
produce
the
most
common
simulation
that
matches
the
average
polling
data
.
I
could
then
change
the
code
of
anywhere
from
1
to
1000
iterations
.
And
this
is
my
problem
.
At
the
end
of
the
test
I
have
an
array
in
a
single
variable
that
looks
something
like
this
:
The
program
currently
produces
one
array
for
each
correct
simulation
.
I
can
store
each
array
in
a
single
variable
","
but
I
then
have
to
have
a
program
that
could
generate
1
to
1000
variables
depending
on
how
many
iterations
I
requested
!
?
How
do
I
avoid
this
?
I
know
there
is
an
intelligent
way
of
doing
this
that
doesn't
require
the
program
to
generate
variables
to
store
arrays
depending
on
how
many
simulations
I
want
.
Code

To
provide
some
timing
figures
behind
the
different
approaches
","
consider
the
following
code
.
The
get()
is
my
custom
addition
to
Python's
setobject.c

being
just
a
pop()

removing
the

The
output
is
:
This
means
that
the
for

break
solution
is
the
fastest
(
sometimes
faster
than
the
custom
get()
solution
)
.
Another
option
is
to
use
a
dictionary
with
values
you
don't
care
about
.
E.g
.
","
You
can
treat
the
keys
as
a
set
except
that
they're
just
an
array

A
side
effect
of
this
choice
is
that
your
code
will
be
backwards
compatible
with
older
","
pre-set
versions
of
Python

It's
maybe
not
the
best
answer
but
it's
another
option
.
Edit
:
You
can
even
do
something
like
this
to
hide
the
fact
that
you
used
a
dict

an
array

not
for
the
set
.
Also
","
iteration
over
a
set
isn't
random
;
the
order
is
undefined
but
predictable
:
If
randomness
is
important
and
you
need
a
bunch
of
elements
in
constant
time
(
large
sets
)
","
I'd
use
random.sample
and
convert
to
a
list
first
:
Suppose
the
following
:
How
do
I
get
a
value
(
any
value
)
out
of
s
without
doing
s.pop()
?
I
want
to
leave
the
item
in
the
set
until
I
am
sure
I
can
remove
it
-
something
I
can
only
be
sure
of
after
an
asynchronous
call
to
another
host
.
Quick
and
dirty
:
But
do
you
know
of
a
better
way
?
Ideally
in
constant
time
.
Least
code
would
be
:
Obviously
this
would
create
a
new
list
which
contains
each
member
of
the
set
","
so
not
great
if
your
set
is
very
large
.
This
way
fits
in
better
with
the
rest
of
the
language
.
The
convention
in
python
is
that
you
add
__foo__
special
methods
to
objects
to
make
them
have
certain
capabilities
(
rather
than
e.g
.
deriving
from
a
specific
base
class
)
.
For
example
","
an
object
is
callable
if
it
has
a
__call__
method
iterable
if
it
has
an
__iter__
method
","
supports
access
with
[]
if
it
has
__getitem__
and
__setitem__
.
...
One
of
these
special
methods
is
__len__
which
makes
it
have
a
length
accessible
with
len()
.
example
:
Python
being
(
very
)
object
oriented
","
I
don't
understand
why
the
'
len
'
function
isn't
inherited
by
the
object
.
Plus
I
keep
trying
the
wrong
solution
since
it
appears
as
the
logical
one
to
me
Well
","
there
actually
is
a
length
method
","
it
is
just
hidden
:
The
len()
built-in
function
appears
to
be
simply
a
wrapper
for
a
call
to
the
hidden
len()
method
of
the
object
.
Not
sure
why
they
made
the
decision
to
implement
things
this
way
though
.
Guido's
explanation
is
here
:
First
of
all
","
I
chose
len(x)
over
x.len()
for
HCI
reasons
(
def
__len__()
came
much
later
)
.
There
are
two
intertwined
reasons
actually
","
both
HCI
:
(
a
)
For
some
operations
","
prefix
notation
just
reads
better
than
postfix
—
prefix
(
and
infix
!
)
operations
have
a
long
tradition
in
mathematics
which
likes
notations
where
the
visuals
help
the
mathematician
thinking
about
a
problem
.
Compare
the
easy
with
which
we
rewrite
a
formula
like
x*(a+b
)
into
xa
+
xb
to
the
clumsiness
of
doing
the
same
thing
using
a
raw
OO
notation
.
(
b
)
When
I
read
code
that
says
len(x)
I
know
that
it
is
asking
for
the
length
of
something
.
This
tells
me
two
things
:
the
result
is
an
integer
","
and
the
argument
is
some
kind
of
container
.
To
the
contrary
","
when
I
read
x.len()
","
I
have
to
already
know
that
x
is
some
kind
of
container
implementing
an
interface
or
inheriting
from
a
class
that
has
a
standard
len()
.
Witness
the
confusion
we
occasionally
have
when
a
class
that
is
not
implementing
a
mapping
has
a
get()
or
keys()
method
","
or
something
that
isn’t
a
file
has
a
write()
method
.
Saying
the
same
thing
in
another
way
","
I
see
‘
len
‘
as
a
built-in
operation
.
I’d
hate
to
lose
that
.
/
…

The
short
answer
:
1
)
backwards
compatibility
and
2
)
there's
not
enough
of
a
difference
for
it
to
really
matter
.
For
a
more
detailed
explanation
","
read
on
.
The
idiomatic
Python
approach
to
such
operations
is
special
methods
which
aren't
intended
to
be
called
directly
.
For
example
","
to
make
x
+
y
work
for
your
own
class
","
you
write
a
__add__
method
.
To
make
sure
that
int(spam)
properly
converts
your
custom
class
","
write
a
__int__
method
.
To
make
sure
that
len(foo)
does
something
sensible
","
write
a
__len__
method
.
This
is
how
things
have
always
been
with
Python
","
and
I
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
for
some
things
.
In
particular
","
this
seems
like
a
sensible
way
to
implement
operator
overloading
.
As
for
the
rest
","
different
languages
disagree
;
in
Ruby
you'd
convert
something
to
an
integer
by
calling
spam.to_i
directly
instead
of
saying
int(spam)
.
You're
right
that
Python
is
an
extremely
object-oriented
language
and
that
having
to
call
an
external
function
on
an
object
to
get
its
length
seems
odd
.
On
the
other
hand
","
len(silly_walks)
isn't
any
more
onerous
than
silly_walks.len()
","
and
Guido
has
said
that
he
actually
prefers
it
(
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html
)
.
Maybe
you're
looking
for
__len__
.
If
that
method
exists
","
then
len(a)
calls
it
:
there
is
some
good
info
below
on
why
certain
things
are
functions
and
other
are
methods
.
It
does
indeed
cause
some
inconsistencies
in
the
language
.
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-January/076612.html
It
just
isn't
.
You
can
","
however
","
do
:
Adding
a
__len__()
method
to
a
class
is
what
makes
the
len()
magic
work
.
One
big
reason
to
learn
Perl
or
Ruby
is
to
help
you
automate
any
complicated
tasks
that
you
have
to
do
over
and
over
.
Or
if
you
have
to
analyse
contents
of
log
files
and
you
need
more
mungeing
than
available
using
grep
","
sed
","
etc.
Also
using
other
languages
","
e.g
.
Ruby
","
that
don't
have
much
""""

let
you
quickly
prototype
ideas

Over
a
decade
ago

when

was
learning
the
ways

the
Computer
","
the
Old
Wise
Men
With

explained
how
C

the
tools
of
the

.
No
one
used
Pascal

only
the
foolhardy
would
risk
their
companies
with
assembler
.
And
of
course
","
no
one
would
even
mention
the
awful
slow
ugly
thing
called
Java
.
It
will
not
be
a
tool
for
serious
business
.
So
.
Um
.
Replace
the
languages
in
the
above
story
and
perhaps
you
can
predict
the
future
.
Perhaps
you
can't
.
Point
is
","
Java
will
not
be
the
Last
Programming
Language
ever
and
also
you
will
most
likely
switch
employers
as
well
.
The
future
is
charging
at
you
24
hours
per
day
.
Be
prepared
.
Learning
new
languages
is
good
for
you
.
Also
","
in
some
cases
it
can
give
you
bragging
rights
for
a
long
time
.
My
first
university
course
was
in
Scheme
.
So
when
people
talk
to
me
about
the
new
language
du
jour
","
my
response
is
something
like
""""
First-class
functions
?
That's
so
last
century
.
""""
And
of
course
","
you
get
more
stuff
done
with
a
high-level
language
.
Testing
.
It's
often
quicker
and
easier
to
test
your
C
#
/
Java
application
by
using
a
dynamic
language
.
You
can
do
exploratory
testing
at
the
interactive
prompt
and
quickly
create
automated
test
scripts
.
A
lot
of
times
some
quick
task
comes
up
that
isn't
part
of
the
main
software
you
are
developing
.
Sometimes
the
task
is
one
off
ie
compare
this
file
to
the
database
and
let
me
know
the
differences
.
It
is
a
lot
easier
to
do
text
parsing
in
Perl
/
Ruby
/
Python
than
it
is
in
Java
or
C
#
(
partially
because
it
is
a
lot
easier
to
use
regular
expressions
)
.
It
will
probably
take
a
lot
less
time
to
parse
the
text
file
using
Perl
/
Ruby
/
Python
(
or
maybe
even
vbscript
cringe
and
then
load
it
into
the
database
than
it
would
to
create
a
Java
/
C
#
program
to
do
it
or
to
do
it
by
hand
.
Also
","
due
to
the
ease
at
which
most
of
the
dynamic
languages
parse
text
","
they
are
great
for
code
generation
.
Sure
your
final
project
must
be
in
C
#
/
Java
/
Transact
SQL
but
instead
of
cutting
and
pasting
100
times
","
finding
errors
","
and
cutting
and
pasting
another
100
times
it
is
often
(
but
not
always
)
easier
just
to
use
a
code
generator
.
A
recent
example
at
work
is
we
needed
to
get
data
from
one
accounting
system
into
our
accounting
system
.
The
system
has
an
import format
","
but
the
old
system
had
a
completely
different
format
(
fixed
width
although
some
things
had
to
be
matched
)
.
The
task
is
not
to
create
a
program
to
migrate
the
data
over
and
over
again
.
It
is
to
shove
the
data
into
our
system
and
then
maintain
it
there
going
forward
.
So
even
though
we
are
a
C
#
and
SQL
Server
shop
","
I
used
Python
to
convert
the
data
into
the
format
that
could
be
imported
by
our
application
.
Ultimately
it
doesn't
matter
that
I
used
python
","
it
matters
that
the
data
is
in
the
system
.
My
boss
was
pretty
impressed
.
Where
I
often
see
the
dynamic
languages
used
for
is
testing
.
It
is
much
easier
to
create
a
Python
/
Perl
/
Ruby
program
to
link
to
a
web
service
and
throw
some
data
against
it
than
it
is
to
create
the
equivalent
Java
program
.
You
can
also
use
python
to
hit
against
command
line
programs
","
generate
a
ton
of
garbage
(
but
still
valid
)
test
data
","
etc..
quite
easily
.
The
other
thing
that
dynamic
languages
are
big
on
is
code
generation
.
Creating
the
C
#
/
C
+
+
/
Java
code
.
Some
examples
follow
:
The
first
code
generation
task
I
often
see
is
people
using
dynamic
languages
to
maintain
constants
in
the
system
.
Instead
of
hand
coding
a
bunch
of
enums
","
a
dynamic
language
can
be
used
to
fairly
easily
parse
a
text
file
and
create
the
Java
/
C
#
code
with
the
enums
.
SQL
is
a
whole
other
ball
game
but
often
you
get
better
performance
by
cut
and
pasting
100
times
instead
of
trying
to
do
a
function
(
due
to
caching
of
execution
plans
or
putting
complicated
logic
in
a
function
causing
you
to
go
row
by
row
instead
of
in
a
set
)
.
In
fact
it
is
quite
useful
to
use
the
table
definition
to
create
certain
stored
procedures
automatically
.
It
is
always
better
to
get
buy
in
for
a
code
generator
.
But
even
if
you
don't
","
is
it
more
fun
to
spend
time
cutting
/
pasting
or
is
it
more
fun
to
create
a
Perl
/
Python
/
Ruby
script
once
and
then
have
that
generate
the
code
?
If
it
takes
you
hours
to
hand
code
something
but
less
time
to
create
a
code
generator
","
then
even
if
you
use
it
once
you
have
saved
time
and
hence
money
.
If
it
takes
you
longer
to
create
a
code
generator
than
it
takes
to
hand
code
once
but
you
know
you
will
have
to
update
the
code
more
than
once
","
it
may
still
make
sense
.
If
it
takes
you
2
hours
to
hand
code
","
4
hours
to
do
the
generator
but
you
know
you'll
have
to
hand
code
equivalent
work
another
5
or
6
times
than
it
is
obviously
better
to
create
the
generator
.
Also
some
things
are
easier
with
dynamic
languages
than
Java
/
C
#
/
C
/
C
+
+
.
In
particular
regular
expressions
come
to
mind
.
If
you
start
using
regular
expressions
in
Perl
and
realize
their
value
","
you
may
suddenly
start
making
use
of
the
Java
regular
expression
library
if
you
haven't
before
.
If
you
have
then
there
may
be
something
else
.
I
will
leave
you
with
one
last
example
of
a
task
that
would
have
been
great
for
a
dynamic
language
.
My
work
mate
had
to
take
a
directory
full
of
files
and
burn
them
to
various
cd's
for
various
customers
.
There
were
a
few
customers
but
a
lot
of
files
and
you
had
to
look
in
them
to
see
what
they
were
.
He
did
this
task
by
hand....A
Java
/
C
#
program
would
have
saved
time
","
but
for
one
time
and
with
all
the
development
overhead
it
isn't
worth
it
.
However
slapping
something
together
in
Perl
/
Python
/
Ruby
probably
would
have
been
worth
it
.
He
spent
several
hours
doing
it
.
It
would
have
taken
less
than
one
to
create
the
Python
script
to
inspect
each
file
","
match
which
customer
it
goes
to
","
and
then
move
the
file
to
the
appropriate
place.....Again
","
not
part
of
the
standard
job
.
But
the
task
came
up
as
a
one
off
.
Is
it
better
to
do
it
yourself
","
spend
the
larger
amount
of
time
to
make
Java
/
C
#
do
the
task
","
or
spend
a
much
smaller
amount
of
time
doing
it
in
Python
/
Perl
/
Ruby
.
If
you
are
using
C
or
C
+
+
the
point
is
even
more
dramatic
due
to
the
extra
concerns
of
programming
in
C
or
C
+
+
(
pointers
","
no
array
bounds
checking
","
etc.
)
.
Personally
I
work
on
a
Java
app
","
but
I
couldn't
get
by
without
perl
for
some
supporting
scripts
.
I've
got
scripts
to
quickly
flip
what
db
I'm
pointing
at
","
scripts
to
run
build
scripts
","
scripts
to
scrape
data
&
compare
stuff
.
Sure
I
could
do
all
that
with
java
","
or
maybe
shell
scripts
(
I've
got
some
of
those
too
)
","
but
who
wants
to
compile
a
class
(
making
sure
the
classpath
is
set
right
etc
)
when
you
just
need
something
quick
and
dirty
.
Knowing
a
scripting
language
can
remove
90
%
of
those
boring
/
repetitive
manual
tasks
.
Don't
tell
your
employer
that
you
want
to
learn
Ruby
.
Tell
him
you
want
to
learn
about
the
state-of-the-art
in
web
framework
technologies
.
it
just
happens
that
the
hottest
ones
are
Django
and
Ruby
on
Rails
.
You
should
also
consider
learning
a
functional
programming
language
like
Scala
.
It
has
many
of
the
advantages
of
Ruby
","
including
a
concise
syntax
","
and
powerful
features
like
closures
.
But
it
compiles
to
Java
class
files
and
and
integrate
seamlessly
into
a
Java
stack
","
which
may
make
it
much
easier
for
your
employer
to
swallow
.
Scala
isn't
dynamically
typed
","
but
its
""""
implicit
conversion
""""
feature
gives
many
","
perhaps
even
all
of
the
benefits
of
dynamic
typing

while
retaining
many
of
the
advantages
of
static
typing

The

ideal

IMHO
","
the
latter
two
can
make
a
huge
impact
on
a
programmer's
productivity
.
It
amazes
me
how
many
people
trudge
through
things
manually
instead
of
whipping
up
a
tool
to
do
it
for
them
.
I
think
it's
because
they
don't
have
something
like
Perl
in
their
toolbox
.
The
ability
to
interface
with
just
about
anything
(
other
programs

languages
","
databases
","

)
makes
it
easy
to
reuse
existing
work

automate
tasks
that
would
otherwise

to
be
done
manually
.
Dynamic
languages
are
a
different
way
to
think
and
sometimes
the
practices
you
learn
from
a
dynamic
or
functional
language
can
transfer
to
the
more
statically
typed
languages
but
if
you
never
take
the
time
to
learn
different
languages
","
you'll
never
get
the
benefit
of
having
a
knew
way

think
when
you

coding

an
article
several
years
ago
about
why
Python
programmers
made
better
Java
programmers
.
(
http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html
)
Basically
","
regardless
of
whether
the
new
language
is
relevant
to
the
company's
current
methodology
","
learning
a
new
language
means
learning
new
ideas
.
Someone
who
is
willing
to
learn
a
language
that
isn't
considered
""""
business
class
""""
means
that
he
is
interested
in
programming
","
beyond
just
earning
a
paycheck
.
To
quote
Paul's
site
:
And
people
don't
learn
Python
because
it
will
get
them
a
job
;
they
learn
it
because
they
genuinely
like
to
program
and
aren't
satisfied
with
the
languages
they
already
know
.
Which
makes
them
exactly
the
kind
of
programmers
companies
should
want
to
hire
.
Hence
what
","
for
lack
of
a
better
name
","
I'll
call
the
Python
paradox
:
if
a
company
chooses
to
write
its
software
in
a
comparatively
esoteric
language
","
they'll
be
able
to
hire
better
programmers
","
because
they'll
attract
only
those
who
cared
enough
to
learn
it
.
And
for
programmers
the
paradox
is
even
more
pronounced
:
the
language
to
learn
","
if
you
want
to
get
a
good
job
","
is
a
language
that
people
don't
learn
merely
to
get
a
job
.
If
an
employer
was
willing
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
learning
a
new
language
","
chances
are
the
people
who
volunteered
to
learn
(
assuming
it
wasn't
a
mandatory
class
)
would
be
the
same
people
to
are
already
on
the
""""
fast
track
""""
.
I
don't
think
anyone
has
mentioned
this
yet
.
Learning
a
new
language
can
be
fun
!
Surely
that's
a
good
enough
reason
to
try
something
new
.
Others
have
already
explained
why
learning
more
languages
makes
you
a
better
programmer
.
As
for
convincing
your
boss
it's
worth
it
","
this
is
probably
just
your
company's
culture
.
Some
places
make
career
and
skill
progress
a
policy
(
move
up
or
out
)
","
some
places
value
it
but
leave
it
up
to
the
employee's
initiative
","
and
some
places
are
very
focused
on
the
bottom
line
.
If
you
have
to
explain
why
learning
a
language
is
a
good
thing
to
your
boss
","
my
advice
would
be
to
stay
at
work
only
as
long
as
necessary
","
then
go
home
and
study
new
things
on
your
own
.
For
after

literate

They're
useful
for
the
""""
Quick
Hack
""""
that
is
for
plugging
a
gap
in
your
main
language
for
a
quick
(
and
potentially
dirty
)
fix
faster
than
it
would
take
to
develop
the
same
in
your
main
language
.
An
example
:
a
simple
script
in
perl
to
go
through
a
large
text
file
and
replace
all
instances
of
an
email
address
with
another
is
trivial
with
an
amount
of
time
taken
in
the
10
minute
range
.
Hacking
a
console
app
together
to
do
the
same
in
your
main
language
would
take
multiples
of
that
.
You
also
have
the
benefit
that
exposing
yourself
to
additional
languages
broadens
your
abilities
and
learning
to
attack
problems
from
a
different
languages
perspective
can
be
as
valuable
as
the
language
itself
.
Finally
","
scripting
languages
are
very
useful
in
the
realm
of
extension
.
Take
LUA
as
an
example
.
You
can
bolt
a
lua
interpreter
into
your
app
with
very
little
overhead
and
you
now
have
a
way
to
create
rich
scripting
functionality
that
can
be
exposed
to
end
users
or
altered
and
distributed
quickly
without
requiring
a
rebuild
of
the
entire
app
.
This
is
used
to
great
effect
in
many
games
most
notably
World
of
Warcraft
.
Given
the
increasing
focus
to
running
dynamic
languages
(
da-vinci
vm
etc.
)
on
the
JVM
and
the
increasing
number
of
dynamic
languages
that
do
run
on
it
(
JRuby
","
Grrovy
","
Jython
)
I
think
the
usecases
are
just
increasing
.
Some
of
the
scenarios
I
found
really
benifited
are
Prototyping
-
use
RoR
or
Grails
to
build
quick
prototypes
with
advantage
of
being
able
to
runn
it
on
the
standard
app
server
and
(
maybe
)
reuse
existing
services
etc.
Testing
-
right
unit
tests
much
much
faster
in
dynamic
languages
Performance
/
automation
test
scripting
-
some
of
these
tools
are
starting
to
allow
the
use
standard
dynamic
language
of
choice
to
write
the
test
scripts
instead
of
proprietary
script
languages
.
Side
benefit
might
be
to
the
able
to
reuse
some
unit
test
code
you've
already
written
.
If
all
you
have
is
a
hammer
","
every
problem
begins
to
look
like
a
nail
.
There
are
times
when
having
a
screwdriver
or
pair
of
pliers
makes
a
complicated
problem
trivial
.

Knowing
grep

it

narrow
down

fix

Because
I
threw
the
solution
together

it

I
could
have
solved
the

problem
using
an
all-java
solution
or
a
C
#
solution
","
but
it
most
likely
would
have
taken
me
longer
.
Having
dynamic
language
expertise
also
sometimes
leads
you
to
simpler
solutions
in
less
dynamic
languages
.
In
ruby
","
perl

python
","
you
just
intuitively
reach
for
associative
arrays

hashes

whatever
word
you
want
to
use

for

where
you
might
be
tempted
to
create
a
complex
class
hierarchy
in
a
statically
typed
language
when
the
problem
doesn't
necessarily
demand
it
.
Plus
you
can
plug
in
most
scripting
languages
into
most
runtimes
.
So
it
doesn't
have
to
be
either
/
or
.
Learning
a
new
language
is
a
long-term
process
.
In
a
couple
of
days
you'll
learn
the
basics
","
yes
.
But
!
As
you
probably
know
","
the
real
practical
applicability
of
any
language
is
tied
to
the
standard
library
and
other
available
components
.
Learning
how
to
use
the
efficiently
requires
a
lot
of
hands-on
experience
.
Perhaps
the
only
immediate
short-term
benefit
is
that
developers
learn
to
distinguish
the
nails
that
need
a
Python

long-term
benefits

the
best
of
my
understanding
","
time.clock()
has
as
much
precision

your
system
will
allow
it
.
The
short
answer
is
:
most
of
the
time
time.clock()
will
be
better
.
However
","
if
you're
timing
some
hardware

then
time.clock()

solution
left

this

worse

look
at

Usually

because
operating

preferred
.
For
my
own
practice
.
time()

better
precision

.
clock()
only
has

One
thing
to
keep
in
mind
:
Changing

affects
time.time()
but
not
time.clock()
.
I
needed
to
control
some
automatic
tests
executions
.
If
one
step
of
the
test
case
took
more
than
a
given
amount
of
time
","
that
TC
was
aborted
to
go
on
with
the
next
one
.
But
sometimes
a
step
needed
to
change
the
system
time
(
to
check
the
scheduler
module
of
the
application
under
test
)
","
so
after
setting
the
system
time
a
few
hours
in
the
future
","
the
TC
timeout
expired
and
the
test
case
was
aborted
.
I
had
to
switch
from
time.time()
to
time.clock()
to
handle
this
properly
.
Short
answer
:
use
time.clock()
for
timing
in
Python
.
On
*
nix
systems
","
clock()
returns
the
processor
time
as
a
floating
point
number
","
expressed
in
seconds
.
On
Windows
","
it
returns
the
seconds
elapsed
since
the
first
call
to
this
function
","
as
a
floating
point
number
.
time()
returns
the
the
seconds
since
the
epoch
","
in
UTC
","
as
a
floating
point
number
.
There
is
no
guarantee
that
you
will
get
a
better
precision
that
1
second
(
even
though
time()
returns
a
floating
point
number
)
.
Also
note
that
if
the
system
clock
has
been
set
back
between
two
calls
to
this
function
","
the
second
function
call
will
return
a
lower
value
.
The
difference
is
very
platform-specific
.
clock()
is
very
different
on
Windows
than
on
Linux
","
for
example
.
For
the
sort
of
examples
you
describe

you
probably
want
the
""""
timeit
""""

","
I
suspect
it
would
be
easier
to
use
SMTP
rather
than
HTTP
to
send
the
data
.
I
can't
think
of
a
way
to
do
this
without
including
a
username
and
password
for
the
smtp
server
in
the
application
...
You
only
need
a
username
and
password
for
authenticating
yourself
to
a
smarthost
.
You
don't
need
it
to
send
mail
directly
","
you
need
it
to
send
mail
through
a
relay
","
e.g
.
your
ISP's
mail
server
.
It's
perfectly
possible
to
send
email
without
authentication
-
that's
why
spam
is
so
hard
to
stop
.
Having
said
that
","
some
ISPs
block
outbound
traffic
on
port
25
","
so
the
most
robust
alternative
is
an
HTTP
POST
","
which
is
unlikely
to
be
blocked
by
anything
.
Be
sure
to
pick
a
URL
that
you
won't
feel
restricted
by
later
on
","
or
better
yet
","
have
the
application
periodically
check
for
updates
","
so
if
you
decide
to
change
domains
or
something
","
you
can
push
an
update
in
advance
.
Security
isn't
really
an
issue
.
You
can
fairly
easily
discard
junk
data
","
so
all
that
really
concerns
you
is
whether
or
not
somebody
would
go
to
the
trouble
of
constructing
fake
tracebacks
to
mess
with
you
","
and
that's
a
very
unlikely
situation
.
As
for
the
payload
","
PyCrash
can
help
you
with
that
.
What
would
be
the
best
way
to
implement
a
simple
crash
/
error
reporting
mechanism
?
Details
:
my
app
is
cross-platform
(
mac
/
windows
/
linux
)
and
written
in
Python
","
so
I
just
need
something
that
will
send
me
a
small
amount
of
text
","
e.g
.
just
a
timestamp
and
a
traceback
(
which
I
already
generate
and
show
in
my
error
dialog
)
.
It
would
be
fine
if
it
could
simply
email
it
","
but
I
can't
think
of
a
way
to
do
this
without
including
a
username
and
password
for
the
smtp
server
in
the
application
...
Should
I
implement
a
simple
web
service
on
the
server
side
and
have
my
app
send
it
an
HTTP
request
with
the
info
?
Any
better
ideas
?
Thanks
!
Some
kind
of
simple
web
service
would
suffice
.
You
would
have
to
consider
security
so
not
just
anyone
could
make
requests
to
your
service
.
.
On
a
larger
scale
we
considered
a
JMS
messaging
system
.
Put
a
serialized
object
of
data
containing
the
traceback
/
error
message
into
a
queue
and
consume
it
every
x
minutes
generating
reports
/
alerts
from
that
data
.
The
web
hit
is
the
way
to
go
","
but
make
sure
you
pick
a
good
URL
-
your
app
will
be
hitting
it
for
years
to
come
.
The
web
service
is
the
best
way
","
but
there
are
some
caveats
:
You
should
always
ask
the
user
if
it
is
ok
to
send
error
feedback
information
.
You
should
be
prepared
to
fail
gracefully
if
there
are
network
errors
.
Don't
let
a
failure
to
report
a
crash
impede
recovery
!
You
should
avoid
including
user
identifying
or
sensitive
information
unless
the
user
knows
(
see
#
1
)
and
you
should
either
use
SSL
or
otherwise
protect
it
.
Some
jurisdictions
impose
burdens
on
you
that
you
might
not
want
to
deal
with
","
so
it's
best
to
simply
not
save
such
information
.
Like
any
web
service
","
make
sure
your
service
is
not
exploitable
by
miscreants
.
Jython
and
IronPython
are
useful
if
you
have
an
overriding
need
to
interface
with
existing
libraries
written
in
a
different
platform
","
like
if
you
have
100
","
000
lines
of
Java
and
you
just
want
to
write
a
20-line
Python
script
.
Not
particularly
useful
for
anything
else
","
in
my
opinion
","
because
they
are
perpetually
a
few
versions
behind
CPython
due
to
community
inertia
.
Stackless
is
interesting
because
it
has
support
for
green
threads
","
continuations
","
etc.
Sort
of
an
Erlang-lite
.
PyPy
is
an
experimental
interpreter
/
compiler
that
may
one
day
supplant
CPython
","
but
for
now
is
more
of
a
testbed
for
new
ideas
.
Pros
:
Access
to
the
libraries
available
for
JVM
or
CLR
.
Cons
:
Both
naturally
lag
behind
CPython
in
terms
of
features
.
PyPy
is
a
Python
implementation
written
in
RPython
wich
is
a
Python
subset
.
RPython
can
be
translated
to
run
on
a
VM
or
","
unlike
standard
Python
","
RPython
can
be
statically
compiled
.
I
am
relatively
new
to
Python
","
and
I
have
always
used
the
standard
cpython
(
v2.5
)
implementation
.
I've
been
wondering
about
the
other
implementations
though
","
particularly
Jython
and
IronPython
.
What
makes
them
better
?
What
makes
them
worse
?
What
other
implementations
are
there
?
I
guess
what
I'm
looking
for
is
a
summary
and
list
of
pros
and
cons
for
each
implementation
.
An
additional
benefit
for
Jython
","
at
least
for
some
","
is
it
lacks
the
GIL
(
the
Global
Interpreter
Lock
)
and
uses
Java's
native
threads
.
This
means
that
you
can
run
pure
Python
code
in
parallel
","
something
not
possible
with
the
GIL
.
IronPython
and
Jython
use
the
runtime
environment
for
.
NET
or
Java
and
with
that
comes
Just
In
Time
compilation
and
a
garbage
collector
different
from
the
original
CPython
.
They
might
be
also
faster
than
CPython
thanks
to
the
JIT
","
but
I
don't
know
that
for
sure
.
A
downside
in
using
Jython
or
IronPython
is
that
you
cannot
use
native
C
modules
","
they
can
be
only
used
in
CPython
.
All
of
the
implementations
are
listed
here
:
https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations
CPython
is
the
""""
reference
implementation

developed

core
developers

ElementTree
1.3
(
unfortunately
not
1.2
which
is
the
one
included
with
Python
)
supports
XPath
like
this
:
Then
you
can
do
lxml.etree
(
which
also
provides
the
ElementTree
interface
)
will
also
work
in
the
same
way
.
You
can
do
this
with
BeautifulSoup
If
you're
doing
work
with
HTML
/
XML
I
would
recommend
you
take
a
look
at
BeautifulSoup
.
It's
similar
to
the
DOM
tree
but
contains
more
functionality
.
I'm
not
really
an
old
hand
at
Python
","
but
here's
an
XPath
solution
using
libxml2
.
With
result
...
Using
a
standard
W3
DOM
such
as
the
stdlib's
minidom
","
or
pxdom
:
I
need
to
get
a
list
of
attribute
values
from
child
elements
in
Python
.
It's
easiest
to
explain
with
an
example
.
Given
some
XML
like
this
:
I
want
to
be
able
to
do
something
like
:
It
looks
like
a
job
for
XPath
but
I'm
open
to
all
recommendations
.
I'd
also
like
to
hear
about
your
favourite
Python
XML
libraries
.
My
preferred
python
xml
library
is
lxml
","
which
wraps
libxml2
.
Xpath
does
seem
the
way
to
go
here
","
so
I'd
write
this
as
something
like
:
I
must
admit
I'm
a
fan
of
xmltramp
due
to
its
ease
of
use
.
Accessing
the
above
becomes
:
In

task

the
member

the
ElementTree
","
below
snippet
shows
a
way
to
get
the
list

NOTE
that
this
example
doesn't
consider
namespaces

which
if
present
","
will
need
to
be
accounted
for

REFERENCE
:

Returns
the
element
attributes

a
sequence

Python
manual
We
are
mainting
a
web
application
that
is
built
on
Classic
ASP
using
VBScript
as
the
primary
language
.
We
are
in
agreement
that
our
backend
(
framework
if
you
will
)
is
out
dated
and
doesn't
provide
us
with
the
proper
tools
to
move
forward
in
a
quick
manner
.
We
have
pretty
much
embraced
the
current
webMVC
pattern
that
is
all
over
the
place
","
and
cannot
do
it
","
in
a
reasonable
manner
","
with
the
current
technology
.
The
big
missing
features
are
proper
dispatching
and
templating
with
inheritance
","
amongst
others
.
Currently
there
are
two
paths
being
discussed
:
Port
the
existing
application
to
Classic
ASP
using
JScript
","
which
will
allow
us
to
hopefully
go
from
there
to
.
NET
MSJscript
without
too
much
trouble
","
and
eventually
end
up
on
the
.
NET
platform
(
preferably
the
MVC
stuff
will
be
done
by
then
","
ASP.NET
isn't
much
better
than
were
we
are
on
now
","
in
our
opinions
)
.
This
has
been
argued
as
the
safer
path
with
less
risk
than
the
next
option
","
albeit
it
might
take
slightly
longer
.
Completely
rewrite
the
application
using
some
other
technology
","
right
now
the
leader
of
the
pack
is
Python
WSGI
with
a
custom
framework
","
ORM
","
and
a
good
templating
solution
.
There
is
wiggle
room
here
for
even
django
and
other
pre-built
solutions
.
This
method
would
hopefully
be
the
quickest
solution
","
as
we
would
probably
run
a
beta
beside
the
actual
product
","
but
it
does
have
the
potential
for
a
big
waste
of
time
if
we
can't
/
don't
get
it
right
.
This
does
not
mean
that
our
logic
is
gone
","
as
what
we
have
built
over
the
years
is
fairly
stable
","
as
noted
just
difficult
to
deal
with
.
It
is
built
on
SQL
Server
2005
with
heavy
use
of
stored
procedures
and
published
on
IIS
6
","
just
for
a
little
more
background
.
Now
","
the
question
.
Has
anyone
taken
either
of
the
two
paths
above
?
If
so
","
was
it
successful
","
how
could
it
have
been
better
","
etc.
We
aren't
looking
to
deviate
much
from
doing
one
of
those
two
things
","
but
some
suggestions
or
other
solutions
would
potentially
be
helpful
.
Half
a
year
ago
I
took
over
a
large
web
application
(
fortunately
already
in
Python
)
which
had
some
major
architectural
deficiencies
(
templates
and
code
mixed
","
code
duplication
","
you
name
it
...
)
.
My
plan
is
to
eventually
have
the
system
respond
to
WSGI
","
but
I
am
not
there
yet
.
I
found
the
best
way
to
do
it
","
is
in
small
steps
.
Over
the
last
6
month
","
code
reuse
has
gone
up
and
progress
has
accelerated
.
General
principles
which
have
worked
for
me
:
Throw
away
code
which
is
not
used
or
commented
out
Throw
away
all
comments
which
are
not
useful
Define
a
layer
hierarchy
(
models
","
business
logic
","
view
/
controller
logic
","
display
logic
","
etc.
)
of
your
application
.
This
has
not
to
be
very
clear
cut
architecture
but
rather
should
help
you
think
about
the
various
parts
of
your
application
and
help
you
better
categorize
your
code
.
If
something
grossly
violates
this
hierarchy
","
change
the
offending
code
.
Move
the
code
around
","
recode
it
at
another
place
","
etc.
At
the
same
time
adjust
the
rest
of
your
application
to
use
this
code
instead
of
the
old
one
.
Throw
the
old
one
away
if
not
used
anymore
.
Keep
you
APIs
simple
!
Progress
can
be
painstakingly
slow
","
but
should
be
worth
it
.
Don't
try
and
go
2.0
(
more
features
then
currently
exists
or
scheduled
)
instead
build
your
new
platform
with
the
intent
of
resolving
the
current
issues
with
the
code
base
(
maintainability
/
speed
/
wtf
)
and
go
from
there
.
I
agree
with
Michael
Pryor
and
Joel
that
it's
almost
always
a
better
idea
to
continue
evolving
your
existing
code
base
rather
than
re-writing
from
scratch
.
There
are
typically
opportunities
to
just
re-write
or
re-factor
certain
components
for
performance
or
flexibility
.
A
good
place
to
begin
if
you're
considering
the
move
to
Python
is
to
rewrite
your
administrator
interface
in
Django
.
This
will
help
you
get
some
of
the
kinks
worked
out

getting
Python
up

.
Speaking
of
which
","
I
recommend
isapi-wsgi
.
It's
by
far
the
easiest
way
to
get
up
and
running
with
IIS
.
Use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
remove
unused
features
!
Definitely
go
with
the
new
language
.
Call
it
2.0
.
It
will
be
a
lot
less
work
to
rebuild
the
80
%
of
it
that
you
really
need
.
Start
by
wiping
your
brain
clean
of
the
whole
application
.
Sit
down
with
a
list
of
its
overall
goals
","
then
decide
which
features
are
needed
based
on
which
ones
are
used
.
Then
redesign
it
with
those
features
in
mind
","

build

I
love
to
delete
code

Whatever
you
do
","
see
if
you
can
manage
to
follow
a
plan
where
you
do
not
have
to
port
the
application
all
in
one
big
bang
.
It
is
tempting
to
throw
it
all
away
and
start
from
scratch
","
but
if
you
can
manage
to
do
it
gradually
the
mistakes
you
do
will
not
cost
so
much
and
cause
so
much
panic
.
I
would
not
recommend
JScript
as
that
is
definitely
the
road
less
traveled
.
ASP.NET
MVC
is
rapidly
maturing
","
and
I
think
that
you
could
begin
a
migration
to
it
","
simultaneously
ramping
up
on
the
ASP.NET
MVC
framework
as
its
finalization
comes
through
.
Another
option
would
be
to
use
something
like
ASP.NET
w
/
Subsonic
or
NHibernate
.
It
works
out
better
than
you'd
believe
.
Recently
I
did
a
large
reverse-engineering
job
on
a
hideous
old
collection
of
C
code
.
Function
by
function
I
reallocated
the
features
that
were
still
relevant
into
classes
","
wrote
unit
tests
for
the
classes
","
and
built
up
what
looked
like
a
replacement
application
.
It
had
some
of
the
original
""""
logic
flow
""""
through
the
classes
","
and
some
classes
were
poorly
designed
[
Mostly
this
was
because
of
a
subset
of
the
global
variables
that
was
too
hard
to
tease
apart
.
]
It
passed
unit
tests
at
the
class
level
and
at
the
overall
application
level
.
The
legacy
source
was
mostly
used
as
a
kind
of
""""
specification
in
C
""""
to
ferret
out
the
really
obscure
business
rules
.
Last
year
","
I
wrote
a
project
plan
for
replacing
30-year
old
COBOL
.
The
customer
was
leaning
toward
Java
.
I
prototyped
the
revised
data
model
in
Python
using
Django
as
part
of
the
planning
effort
.
I
could
demo
the
core
transactions
before
I
was
done
planning
.
Note
:
It
was
quicker
to
build
a
the
model
and
admin
interface
in
Django
than
to
plan
the
project
as
a
whole
.
Because
of
the
""""
we
need
to
use
Java
""""
mentality
","
the
resulting
project
will
be
larger
and
more
expensive
than
finishing
the
Django
demo
.
With
no
real
value
to
balance
that
cost
.
Also
","
I
did
the
same
basic
""""
prototype
in
Django
""""
for
a
VB
desktop
application
that
needed
to
become
a
web
application
.
I
built
the
model
in
Django
","
loaded
legacy
data
","
and
was
up
and
running
in
a
few
weeks
.
I
used
that
working
prototype
to
specify
the
rest
of
the
conversion
effort
.
Note
:
I
had
a
working
Django
implementation
(
model
and
admin
pages
only
)
that
I
used
to
plan
the
rest
of
the
effort
.
The
best
part
about
doing
this
kind
of
prototyping
in
Django
is
that
you
can
mess
around
with
the
model
","
unit
tests
and
admin
pages
until
you
get
it
right

Once
the

right

you
can
spend
the
rest

around

happy

Don't

You've
invested
a

out
many

Throwing

some
things

a

Hence
","
this
is
where
refactoring
comes
in

For

write
it
in
C

call
it

to
be

you
rewrite
this

You
could
also
write

We
wrote
one
for
our
classic

app
a
long
time

allow
us

output
PHP

called
Wasabi

I

the
reason
Jeff

","
maybe
we
should
just
ship
it

you

us
to
switch
our
entire

.
NET

the
next
release
while
only
rewriting
a
very
small
portion
of
our
source
.
It
also
caused
a
bunch
of
people
to
call
us
crazy
","
but
writing
a
compiler
is
not
that
complicated
","
and
it
gave
us
a
lot
of
flexibility
.
Also
","
if
this
is
an
internal
only
app
","
just
leave
it

Don't

it

you
are
the
only
customer
and
if
the
requirement
is
you
need
to
run
it
as
classic
asp
","
you
can
meet
that
requirement
.
Basically
","
something
similar
to
System.Xml.XmlWriter
-
A
streaming
XML
Writer
that
doesn't
incur
much
of
a
memory
overhead

So
that
rules
out
xml.dom

xml.dom.minidom

Apple's
HyperCard

inspirations

simple

powerful

PythonCard
uses
wxPython

If
you
are
already
familiar
with

just
think
of
PythonCard

it

the
above

python

just

Simple
question

Python
GUI

what
are

Python

An
easy
to
use

exist

That's
amazing
really
considering
small
scripting
languages

AutoIt

great

There
are
python-specific
gui-api
such
as
kivy
(
successor
or
pymt
)
","
pygui
(
based
on
pyrex

","
pyui

nufox
","
which
do
not
compare
with
the
more
robust
toolkits
like
wxpython
","
pyqt
","
pygtk
and
tkinter
.
They
are
just
extra
optional
tools
.
The
only
thing
unique
about
them
is
these
are
python-specific

just
like
there
are
prima
(
perl-specific
api
)
and
shoes
(
ruby-specific
api
)
.
It
helps
us
to
understand
that
when
tk
is
tcl-based
port
of
api
(
and
others
are
c
and
c
+
+
based
)
","
then
these
api
are
specifically
done
for
the
respective
three
scripting
languages
.
Out
of
these
","
kivy
is
the
most
robust
","
whereas
pygui's
coding
is
mentioned
to
be
very
python-like
","
pyui
is
least
robust
but
worth
trying
and
all
of
these
should
be
portable
wherever
python
or
python-based
application
goes
.
Then
there
is
jpype
which
is
a
toolkit
usable
with
jython

is
actually
java's
japi
customized

.
I've
used
Tkinter
and
wxPython
.
Tkinter
is
quite
basic
","
and
doesn't
use
native
widgets
.
This
means
that
Tkinter
applications
will
look
the
same
on
any
platform
–
this
might
sound
appealing
","
but
in
practice
","
it
means
they
look
ugly
on
any
platform
:
-
/
Nevertheless
","
it's
pretty
easy
to
use
.
I
found
Thinking
in
Tkinter
very
helpful
when
I
was
learning
","
because
I'd
never
done
any
GUI
programming
before
.
If
things
like
frames
and
layout
algorithms
and
buttons
and
bindings
are
familiar
to
you
","
though
","
you
can
skip
that
step
.
You
can
augment
Tkinter
with
Tix
(
but
be
warned
","
Tix
doesn't
play
well
with
py2exe
)
.
Also
check
out
Python
Megawidgets
","
which
builds
some
more
advanced
controls
using
the
Tkinter
basics
.
Finally
","
Tkinter
plays
nice
with
the
shell
:
you
can
start
the
interpreter
","
do
things
like
'
import tkinter
'
'
tk
=
tkinter.Tk()
'
etc.
and
build
your
GUI
interactively
(
and
it
will
be
responsive
)
.
(
I
think
this
doesn't
work
if
you
use
IDLE
","
though
)
wxPython
is
much
better
looking
","
and
ships
with
a
much
greater
range
of
controls
.
It's
cross-platform
(
though
it
seems
a
bit
finicky
on
my
Mac
)
and
uses
native
controls
on
each
platform
.
It's
a
bit
confusing
","
though
.
It
also
ships
with
a
demo
application
that
shows
off
most
of
its
features
","
and
provides
a
test-bed
for
you
to
experiment
.
Some
specific
thoughts
on
wxPython
:
There
are
three
(
?
)
different
ways
to
lay
widgets
out
.
Ignore
two
of
them
;
just
use
Sizers
.
And
even
then
","
you
can
do
just
about
any
layout
using
only
BoxSizer
and
GridBagSizer
.
All
wx
widgets
have
IDs
.
You
don't
need
to
care
what
the
IDs
are
","
but
in
the
old
days
(
I
think
)
you
did
need
to
know
","
so
some
old
code
will
be
littered
with
explicit
ID
assignments
.
And
most
demo
code
will
have
-
1
everywhere
as
the
ID
parameter
(
despite
the
fact
that
the
methods
all
have
ID
as
a
keyword
parameter
that
defaults
to
-
1
anyway
)
.
Make
sure
you
get
the
standard
wxWidgets
docs
as
well
as
the
wxPython
Demo
–
you
need
them
both
.
If
you
want
to
use
wxPython
with
py2exe
and
you
want
it
to
look
good
on
Windows
XP
","
you
need
a
bit
of
trickery
in
your
setup.py
.
See
here
I
found
this
link
a
long
time
a
go
:
http://www.awaretek.com/toolkits.html.
It
suggests
a
tookit
based
on
your
criteria
.
For
me
it
suggests
wxPython
all
the
time
.
Anyway
it
gives
you
a
bunch
of
scores
on
the
various
toolkits
.
What
is
right
for
me
may
not
be
right
for
you
.
But
it
gives
you
how
all
the
tookits
scored
according
to
your
criteria
","
so
if
you
don't
like
the
top
toolkit
for
some
reason
you
can
see
which
ones
are
closest
to
your
criteria
.
QT
/
GTK
/
WxWidgets
(
formerly
wxWindows
)
seem
to
be
among
the
most
mature
cross
platform
GUI
toolkits
.
The
only
issue
is
that
none
is
installed
with
the
default
installation
of
Python
","
so
you
may
have
to
compile
the
libraries
.
If
you
want
something
with
no
installation
required
that
just
runs
","
then
go
with
TKInter
because
as
has
been
mentioned
it
is
installed
by
default
with
Python
.
Anyway
my
criteria
were
9

Ease
of
Use

I'm
not
big
into

.
PyQt
is
excellent
if
you
have
experience
or
interest
in
Qt
.
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro
Instead
of
posting
a
list
of
your
options
I
will
give
my
humble
opinion
:
I
am
in
love
with
wxPython
.
I
have
used
Qt
in
C
+
+
and
Tk
way
back
in
the
Tcl
days
but
what
really
makes
me
like
wxPython
is
the
demo
that
you
get
with
it
.
In
the
demo
you
can
browse
through
all
the
different
widgets
frames
etc
that
are
part
of
the
framework
see
the
source
code
and
actually
see
how
it
looks
while
it
is
running
.
I
had
some
problems
getting
the
Linux
version
build
and
installed
but
now
that
I
have
it
available
I
use
it
all
the
time
.
I
have
used
wxPython
for
small
data
analysis
applications
and
I
have
written
several
internal
tools
related
to
comparing
test
results
","
merging
source
code
etc.
Most
python
GUI
APIs
will
be
wrappers
around
the
most
common
c
/
c
+
+
GUI
APIs
.
You've
got
a
python
wrapper
for
gtk
","
a
python
wrapper
for
qt
","
a
python
wrapper
for
.
NET
","
etc
etc.
So
really
it
depends
on
what
your
needs
are
.
If
you
are
looking
for
the
easiest
way
to
draw
native-looking
widgets
on
Linux
","
Mac
","
and
Windows
","
then
go
with
wxPython
(
python
wrapper
for
WX
Widgets
)
.
If
cross-platform
isn't
one
of
your
needs
though
","
other
libraries
might
be
more
useful
.
wxPython
","
and
I'm
assuming
PyGTK
also
","
can
use
wxGlade
to
help
you
design
most
UIs
you
will
create
.
That
is
a
big
plus
.
You
don't
have
to
learn
how
to
hand-code
the
GUI
until
you're
ready
.
I
made
several
GUI
programs
straight
from
wxGlade
before
I
was
comfortable
enough
in
how
wxPython
worked
to
take
a
shot
at
hand-coding
.
PyQt
has
a
similar
graphic
layout
device
but
I've
never
had
good
luck
getting
PyQt
to
compile
correctly
.
There
was
also
a
lack
of
tutorials
and
documentation
that
showed
how
to
create
the
final
Python
code
;
many
of
the
documents
I
found
referred
to
the
C
+
+
version
of
Qt
.
Tkinter
is
good
for
quick
and
dirty
programs
but
","
realistically
","
if
you
use
wxGlade
it
may
be
faster
to
make
the
program
with
wxPython
.
At
a
minimum
","
you
can
use
wxGlade
to
show
a
visual
representation
of
the
program
to
a
client
rather
than
take
the
time
to
hand-code
the
""""
dummy
""""
program
.
I
like
wxPython
or
Tk
.
Tk
comes
with
the
standard
Python
distribution
so
you
don't
need
install
anything
else
.
wxPython
(
wxWigets
)
seems
much
more
powerful
and
looks
a
lot
nicer
.
It
also
works
well
cross-platform
(
though
not
perfectly
because
it
uses
different
underlying
graphic
API's
on
diff
system
types
)
I've
been
working
with
wxPython
for
a
few
years
now
and
I
like
it
quite
a
bit
.
The
best
thing
about
wxPython
is
that
the
UI
feels
native
on
the
different
platforms
it
runs
on
(
excellent
on
Windows
and
Linux
though
not
as
good
on
OS
/
X
)
.
The
API
lacks
some
consistency
","
but
you
quickly
get
used
to
it
.
You
can
check
out
Testuff
(
shameless
plug
","
as
it's
my
own
product
)
to
get
a
feeling
of
what
can
be
done
with
wxPython
(
although
I
must
say
","
with
quite
a
bit
of
effort
)
.
Here's
a
good
list
.
The
file
you
create
with
TemporaryFile
or
NamedTemporaryFile
is
automatically
removed
when
it's
closed
","
which
is
why
you
get
an
error
.
If
you
don't
want
this
","
you
can
use
mkstemp
instead
(
see
the
docs
for
tempfile
)
.
I
am
attempting
to
use
the
'
tempfile
'
module
for
manipulating
and
creating
text
files
.
Once
the
file
is
ready
I
want
to
save
it
to
disk
.
I
thought
it
would
be
as
simple
as
using
'
shutil.copy
'
.
However
","
I
get
a
'
permission
denied
'
IOError
:
Is
this
not
intended
when
using
the
'
tempfile
'
library
?
Is
there
a
better
way
to
do
this
?
(
Maybe
I
am
overlooking
something
very
trivial
)
hop
is
right
","
and
dF
.
is
incorrect
on
why
the
error
occurs
.
Since
you
haven't
called
f.close()
yet
","
the
file
is
not
removed
.
The
doc
for
NamedTemporaryFile
says
:
Whether
the
name
can
be
used
to
open
the
file
a
second
time
","
while
the
named
temporary
file
is
still
open
","
varies
across
platforms
(
it
can
be
so
used
on
Unix
;
it
cannot
on
Windows
NT
or
later
)
.
And
for
TemporaryFile
:
Under
Unix
","
the
directory
entry
for
the
file
is
removed
immediately
after
the
file
is
created
.
Other
platforms
do
not
support
this
;
your
code
should
not
rely
on
a
temporary
file
created
using
this
function
having
or
not
having
a
visible
name
in
the
file
system
.
Therefore
","
to
persist
a
temporary
file
(
on
Windows
)
","
you
can
do
the
following
:
The
solution
Hans
Sjunnesson
provided
is
also
off

because
copyfileobj
only
copies

:
"shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst[, length])"
Copy
the
contents
of
the
file-like
object
fsrc
to
the
file-like
object
fdst
.
The
integer
length
","
if
given
","
is
the
buffer
size
.
In
particular
","
a
negative
length
value
means
to
copy
the
data
without
looping
over
the
source
data
in
chunks
;
by
default
the
data
is
read
in
chunks
to
avoid
uncontrolled
memory
consumption
.
Note
that
if
the
current
file
position
of
the
fsrc
object
is
not
0
","
only
the
contents
from
the
current
file
position
to
the
end
of
the
file
will
be
copied
.
Starting
from
python
2.6
you
can
also
use
NamedTemporaryFile
with
the
delete
=
option
set
to
False
.
This
way
the
temporary
file
will
be
accessible
","
even
after
you
close
it
.
Note
that
on
Windows
(
NT
and
later
)
you
cannot
access
the
file
a
second
time
while
it
is
still
open
.
You
have
to
close
it
before
you
can
copy
it
.
This
is
not
true
on
Unix
systems
.
You
could
always
use
shutil.copyfileobj
","
in
your
example
:

Just
as
an

For

your

needs
to
be
modified
slightly
:
Bear
in
mind
that
merely
decompressing
a

may
result
in
a

Here's
how
I
did
it
(
grabbing

:
I
need

I
don't
want
to
save
the

zip
to
a
temporary
file
(
it's
not
that
large
","
so
I
can
handle
everything
in
memory
)
.
I've
already
written
the
code
and
it
works
","
and
I'm
answering
this
myself
so
I
can
search
for
it
later
.
But
since
evidence
suggests
that
I'm
one
of
the
dumber
participants
on
Stackoverflow
","
I'm
sure
there's
room

do

But

documentation
for
the
array
module
Thanks
to
Armin
for
pointing
out
the
'
array
'
module
.
I
also
found
the
'
struct
'
module
that
packs
c-style
structs
in
a
string
:
From
the
documentation
(
https://docs.python.org/library/struct.html
)
:
@Armin
:
how
come
?
The
Python
documentation
said
the
minimum
size
for
that
array
of
short
integer
is
2
bytes
and
The
actual
representation
of
values
is
determined
by
the
machine
architecture
(
strictly
speaking
","
by
the
C
implementation
)
.
The
actual
size
can
be
accessed
through
the
itemsize
attribute
.
@Arnav
:
I
suggest
that
your
code
should
check
the
size
of
each
Type
code
and
choose
the
corresponding
2-byte
type
that
is
specific
to
the
underlying
system
.
Python
allocates
integers
automatically
based
on
the
underlying
system
architecture
.
Unfortunately
I
have
a
huge
dataset
which
needs
to
be
fully
loaded
into
memory
.
So
","
is
there
a
way
to
force
Python
to
use
only
2
bytes
for
some
integers
(
equivalent
of
C
+
+
'
short
'
)
?
Armin's
suggestion
of
the
array
module
is
probably
best
.
Two
possible
alternatives
:
You
can
create
an
extension
module
yourself
that
provides
the
data
structure
that
you're
after
.
If
it's
really
just
something
like
a
collection
of
shorts
","
then
that's
pretty
simple
to
do
.
You
can
cheat
and
manipulate
bits
","
so
that
you're
storing
one
number
in
the
lower
half
of
the
Python
int
","
and
another
one
in
the
upper
half
.
You'd
write
some
utility
functions
to
convert
to
/
from
these
within
your
data
structure
.
Ugly
","
but
it
can
be
made
to
work
.
It's
also
worth
realising
that
a
Python
integer
object
is
not
4
bytes
-
there
is
additional
overhead
.
So
if
you
have
a
really
large
number
of
shorts
","
then
you
can
save
more
than
two
bytes
per
number
by
using
a
C
short
in
some
way
(
e.g
.
the
array
module
)
.
I
had
to
keep
a
large
set
of
integers
in
memory
a
while
ago
","
and
a
dictionary
with
integer
keys
and
values
was
too
large
(
I
had
1GB
available
for
the
data
structure
IIRC
)
.
I
switched
to
using
a
IIBTree
(
from
ZODB
)
and
managed
to
fit
it
.
(
The
ints
in
a
IIBTree
are
real
C
ints
","
not
Python
integers
","
and
I
hacked
up
an
automatic
switch
to
a
IOBTree
when
the
number
was
larger
than
32
bits
)
.
Based
on
other
answers

a

order

I
use

You
can
use
Cairo

has
support
for

pygamesvg

always

some
text
editors
might
replace
a

a

this

Line

go
wrong

So
don't
use
tabs
and
reduce
the
risk

mistakes
.
The
problem
with
tabs
is
that
they
are
invisible

people
can
never
agree

you
will
be

the

because
the

determines
blocks

you
will
be
seeing
different
logic
.
It
leads
to
subtle
bugs
.
If
you
insist
on
defying
PEP
8
and
using
tabs
-
-
or
worse
","
mixing
tabs
and
spaces
-
-
at
least
always
run
python
with
the
'
-
tt

argument
","
which
makes
inconsistent
indentation

sometimes

sometimes
a

the

differently

But
really
","
the
best
approach
is
not
to
use
tabs
","
period
.
The
universal
problem
with
tabs
is
that
they
can
be
represented
differently
in
different
environment
.
In
a
given
editor
","
a
tab
might
be
8
spaces
or
it
might
be
2
.
In
some
editors
","
you
can
control
this
","
while
in
others
you
can't
.
Another
issue
with
tabs
is
how
they
are
represented
in
printed
output
.
I
believe
most
printers
interpret
a
tab
as
8
spaces
.
With
spaces
","
there
is
no
doubt
.
Everything
will
line
up
as
the
author
intended
.
On
the
discussion
between
Jim
and
Thomas
Wouters
in
the
comments
.
The
issue
was
...
since
the
width
of
tabs
and
spaces
both
can
vary
-
-
and
since
programmers
can't
agree
on
either
width
-
-
why
is
it
that
tabs
bear
the
blame
.
I
agree
with
Jim
on
that
-
-
tabs
are
NOT
evil
in
and
of
themselves
.
But
there
is
a
problem
...
With
spaces
I
can
control
how
""""
MY
OWN
CODE
""""
looks
in
EVERY
editor
in
the
world
.
If
I
use
4
spaces
-
-
then
no
matter
what
editor
you
open
my
code
in
","
it
will
have
the
same
distance
from
the
left
margin
.
With
tabs
I
am
at
the
mercy
of
the
tab-width
setting
for
the
editor
-
-
even
for
MY
OWN
CODE
.
And
I
don't
like
that
.
So
while
it
is
true
that
even
spaces
can't
guarantee
consistency
-
-
they
at
least
afford
you
more
control
over
the
look
of
your
OWN
code
everywhere
-
-
something
that
tabs
can't
.
I
think
it's
NOT
the
consistency
in
the
programmers
writing
the
code
-
-
but
the
consistency
in
editors
showing
that
code
-
-
that
spaces
make
easier
to
achieve
(
and
impose
)
.
The
most
significant
advantage
I
can
tell
of
spaces
over
tabs
is
that
a
lot
of
programmers
and
projects
use
a
set
number
of
columns
for
the
source
code
","
and
if
someone
commits
a
change
with
their
tabstop
set
to
2
spaces
and
the
project
uses
4
spaces
as
the
tabstop
the
long
lines
are
going
to
be
too
long
for
other
people's
editor
window
.
I
agree
that
tabs
are
easier
to
work
with
but
I
think
spaces
are
easier
for
collaboration
","
which
is
important
on
a
large
open
source
project
like
Python
.
You
can
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
to
.
Set
your
editor
to
expand
tabs
into
spaces
automatically
.
(
That
would
be
:
set
expandtab
in
Vim
.
)
The
answer
to
the
question
is
:
PEP-8
wants
to
make
a
recommendation
and
has
decided
that
since
spaces
are
more
popular
it
will
strongly
recommend
spaces
over
tabs
.
Notes
on
PEP-8
PEP-8
says
'
Use
4
spaces
per
indentation
level
.
'
Its
clear
that
this
is
the
standard
recommendation
.
'
For
really
old
code
that
you
don't
want
to
mess
up
","
you
can
continue
to
use
8-space
tabs
.
'
Its
clear
that
there
are
SOME
circumstances
when
tabs
can
be
used
.
'
Never
mix
tabs
and
spaces
.
'
This
is
a
clear
prohibition
of
mixing
-
I
think
we
all
agree
on
this
.
Python
can
detect
this
and
often
chokes
.
Using
the
-
tt
argument
makes
this
an
explicit
error
.
'
The
most
popular
way
of
indenting
Python
is
with
spaces
only
.
The
second-most
popular
way
is
with
tabs
only
.
'
This
clearly
states
that
both
are
used
.
Just
to
be
ultra-clear
:
You
should
still
never
mix
spaces
and
tabs
in
same
file
.
'
For
new
projects
","
spaces-only
are
strongly
recommended
over
tabs
.
'
This
is
a
clear
recommendation
","
and
a
strong
one
","
but
not
a
prohibition
of
tabs
.
I
can't
find
a
good
answer
to
my
own
question
in
PEP-8
.
I
use
tabs
","
which
I
have
used
historically
in
other
languages
.
Python
accepts
source
with
exclusive
use
of
tabs
.
That's
good
enough
for
me
.
I
thought
I
would
have
a
go
at
working
with
spaces
.
In
my
editor
","
I
configured
a
file
type
to
use
spaces
exclusively
and
so
it
inserts
4
spaces
if
I
press
tab
.
If
I
press
tab
too
many
times
","
I
have
to
delete
the
spaces
!
Arrgh
!
Four
times
as
many
deletes
as
tabs
!
My
editor
can't
tell
that
I'm
using
4
spaces
for
indents
(
although
AN
editor
might
be
able
to
do
this
)
and
obviously
insists
on
deleting
the
spaces
one
at
a
time
.
Couldn't
Python
be
told
to
consider
tabs
to
be
n
spaces
when
its
reading
indentations
?
If
we
could
agree
on
4
spaces
per
indentation
and
4
spaces
per
tab
and
allow
Python
to
accept
this
","
then
there
would
be
no
problems
.
We
should
find
win-win
solutions
to
problems
.
I
see
on
Stack
Overflow
and
PEP
8
that
the
recommendation
is
to
use
spaces
only
for
indentation
in
Python
programs
.
I
can
understand
the
need
for
consistent
indentation
and
I
have
felt
that
pain
.
Is
there
an
underlying
reason
for
spaces
to
be
preferred
?
I
would
have
thought
that
tabs
were
far
easier
to
work
with
.
Note
that
the
use
of
tabs
confuses
another
aspect
of
PEP
8
:
Limit
all
lines
to
a
maximum
of
79
characters
.
Let's
say
","
hypothetically
","
that
you
use
a
tab
width
of
2
and
I
use
a
tab
width
of
8
.
You
write
all
your
code
so
your
longest
lines
reach
79
characters
","
then
I
start
to
work
on
your
file
.
Now
I've
got
hard-to-read
code
because
(
as
the
PEP
states
)
:
The
default
wrapping
in
most
tools
disrupts
the
visual
structure
of
the
code
If
we
all
use
4
spaces
","
it's
ALWAYS
the
same
.
Anyone
whose
editor
can
support
an
80
character
width
can
comfortably
read
the
code
.
Note
:
The
80
character
limit
is
a
holy
war
in
and
of
itself
","
so
let's
not
start
that
here
.
Any
non-sucky
editor
should
have
an
option
to
use
spaces
as
if
they
were
tabs
(
both
inserting
and
deleting
)
","
so
that
really
shouldn't
be
a
valid
argument
.
The
answer
was
given
right
there
in
the
PEP
[
ed
:
this
passage
has
been
edited
out

What
other
underlying

do
you
need

To
put
it
less
bluntly
:
Consider
also
the
scope
of
the
PEP

stated

the
very
first

hope

spaces

an
individual

a

a

","
there
is
a
clear

he
still

data

For
all
other
purposes
you
can
either
take
this

why

all
other
people

know
this

use

Mixing

a
no-no

argument

is
a
mess

can
never
work

I
personally
don't
agree

To
me
","
tabs
are
a
document
layout
character

mechanism

spaces
are
for
content

delineation

commands
in
the
case

code

I
have
to
agree
with
Jim's
comments
that
tabs
aren't
really
the
issue

it
is
people

how

That
said

I've
forced
myself
to
use
spaces

the
sake

convention

I
value
consistency

personal
preference

Since
python
relies
on
indentation
in
order
to
recognize
program
structure
","
a
clear
way
to
identify
identation
is
required
.
This
is
the
reason
to
pick
either
spaces

tabs

However
","
python
also
has
a
strong
philosophy

only
having
one
way
to
do
things
","
therefore
there
should
be
an
official
recommendation

one
way

do
indentation

Both
spaces
and
tabs
pose
unique
challenges

an
editor

handle

indentation

The
handling
of
tabs
themselves
is
not
uniform
across
editors
or
even
user
settings

Since
spaces
are
not
configurable

they
pose
the
more
logical
choice

they
guarantee
that
the
outcome
will
look

JWZ
says
it
best
:
When
[
people
are
]
reading
code
","
and
when
they're
done
writing
new
code
","
they
care
about
how
many
screen
columns
by
which
the
code
tends
to
indent
when
a
new
scope
(
or
sexpr
","
or
whatever
)
opens
...
...
My
opinion
is
that
the
best
way
to
solve
the
technical
issues
is
to
mandate
that
the
ASCII
#
9
TAB
character
never
appear
in
disk
files
:
program
your
editor
to
expand
TABs
to
an
appropriate
number
of
spaces
before
writing
the
lines
to
disk
...
...
This
assumes
that
you
never
use
tabs
in
places
where
they
are
actually
significant
","
like
in
string
or
character
constants
","
but
I
never
do
that
:
when
it
matters
that
it
is
a
tab
","
I
always
use
'
\
t
'
instead
.
The
main
problems
with
indentation
occur
when
you
mix
tabs
and
spaces
.
Obviously
this
doesn't
tell
you
which
you
should
choose
","
but
it
is
a
good
reason
to
to
recommend
one
","
even
if
you
pick
it
by
flipping
a
coin
.
However
","
IMHO
there
are
a
few
minor
reasons
to
favour
spaces
over
tabs
:
Different
tools
.
Sometimes
code
gets
displayed
outside
of
a
programmer's
editor
.
Eg
.
posted
to
a
newsgroup
or
forum
.
Spaces
generally
do
better
than
tabs
here
-
everywhere
spaces
would
get
mangled
","
tabs
do
as
well
","
but
not
vice-versa
.
Programmers
see
the
source
differently
.
This
is
deeply
subjective
-
its
either
the
main
benefit
of
tabs
","
or
a
reason
to
avoid
them
depending
on
which
side
you're
on
.
On
the
plus
side
","
developers
can
view
the
source
with
their
preferred
indentation
","
so
a
developer
preferring
2-space
indent
can
work
with
an
8-space
developer
on
the
same
source
and
still
see
it
as
they
like
.
The
downside
is
that
there
are
repercussions
to
this
-
some
people
like
8-space
because
it
gives
very
visible
feedback
that
they're
too
deeply
nested
-
they
may
see
code
checked
in
by
the
2-indenter
constantly
wrapping
in
their
editor
.
Having
every
developer
see
the
code
the
same
way
leads
to
more
consistency
wrt
line
lengths
","
and
other
matters
too
.
Continued
line
indentation
.
Sometimes
you
want
to
indent
a
line
to
indicate
it
is
carried
from
the
previous
one
.
eg
.
If
using
tabs
","
theres
no
way
to
align
this
for
people
using
different
tabstops
in
their
editor
without
mixing
spaces
and
tabs
.
This
effectively
kills
the
above
benefit
.
Obviously
though
","
this
is
a
deeply
religious
issue
","
which
programming
is
plagued
with
.
The
most
important
issue
is
that
we
should
choose
one
-
even
if
thats
not
the
one
you
favour
.
Sometimes
I
think
that
the
biggest
advantage
of
significant
indentation
is
that
at
least
we're
spared
brace
placement
flamewars
.
Also
worth
reading
is
this
article
by
Jamie
Zawinski
on
the
issue
.
I've
always
used
tabs
in
my
code
.
That
said
","
I've
recently
found
a
reason
to
use
spaces
:
When
developing
on
my
Nokia
N900
internet
tablet
","
I
now
had
a
keyboard
without
a
tab
key
.
This
forced
me
to
either
copy
and
paste
tabs
or
re-write
my
code
with
spaces
.
I've
run
into
the
same
problem
with
other
phones
.
Granted
","
this
is
not
a
standard
use
of
Python
","
but
something
to
keep
in
mind
.
Besides
all
the
other
reasons
already
named
(
consistency
","
never
mixing
spaces
and
tabs
etc
)
I
believe
there
are
a
few
more
reasons
for
the
4
spaces
convention
to
note
.
These
only
apply
to
Python
(
and
maybe
other
languages
where
indentation
has
meaning
)
.
Tabs
may
be
nicer
in
other
languages
","
depending
on
individual
preferences
.
If
an
editor
doesn't
show
tabs
(
which
happens
","
depending
on
the
configuration
","
in
quite
a
few
)
","
another
author
might
assume
that
your
code
uses
4
spaces
","
b
/
c
almost
all
of
the
Python
code
being
publicly
available
does
;
if
that
same
editor
happens
to
have
a
tab
width
of
4
","
nasty
things
may
happen
-
at
least
","
that
poor
person
will
lose
time
over
an
indentation
issue
that
would
have
been
very
easy
to
avoid
by
sticking
to
the
convention
.
So
for
me
","
the
number
one
reason
is
to
avoid
bugs
with
consistency
.
Reframing
the
question
of
which
is
better
","
tabs
or
spaces
","
one
should
ask
which
the
advantages
of
tabs
are
;
I've
seen
plenty
posts
praising
tabs
","
but
few
compelling
arguments
for
them
;
good
editors
like
emacs
","
vi(m)
","
kate
","
...
do
proper
indentation
depending
on
the
semantics
of
your
code
-
even
without
tabs
;
the
same
editors
can
easily
be
configured
to
unindent
on
backspace
etc.
Some
people
have
very
strong
preferences
when
it
comes
to
their
freedom
in
deciding
the
look
/
layout
of
code
;
others
value
consistency
over
this
freedom
.
Python
drastically
reduces
this
freedom
by
dictating
that
indentation
is
used
for
blocks
etc.
This
may
be
seen
as
a
bug
or
a
feature
","
but
it
sort
of
comes
with
choosing
Python
.
Personally
","
I
like
this
consistency
-
when
starting
to
code
on
a
new
project
","
at
least
the
layout
is
close
to
what
I'm
used
to
","
so
it's
fairly
easy
to
read
.
Almost
always
.
Using
spaces
for
indentation
allows
""""
layout
tricks
""""
that
may
facilitate
to
comprehend
code
;
some
examples
of
these
are
listed
in
PEP8
;
eg
.
Of
course
","
the
above
can
also
be
written
nicely
as
However
","
the
latter
takes
more
lines
of
code
and
less
lines
are
sometimes
argued
to
be
better
(
b
/
c
you
get
more
on
a
single
screen

.
But
if
you
like
alignment
","
spaces
(
preferably
assisted
by
a
good
editor
)
give
you
","
in
a
sense
","
more
freedom
in
Python
than
tabs
.
[
Well
","
I
guess
some
editors
allow
you
to
do
the
same
w
/
tabs

)
-
but
with

]
Coming
back
to
the
same
argument
that
everybody
else
makes
-
PEP
8
dictates
(
ok
","
strongly
recommends
)
spaces
.
If
coming
to
a
project
that
uses
tabs
only
","
of
course
","
you
have
little
choice
.
But
because
of
the
establishment
of
the
PEP
8
conventions
","
almost
all
Python
programmers
are
used
to
this
style
.
This
makes
it
sooooo
much
easier
to
find
a
consensus
on
a
style
that
is
accepted
by
most
programmers
...
and
having
individuals
agree
on
style
might
be
very
hard
otherwise
.
Tools
that
help
enforcing
style
are
usually
aware
of
PEP
8
without
extra
effort
.
That's
not
a
great
reason
","
but
it's
just
nice
to
have
things
work
~
out
of
the
box
.
I'd
like
to
know
do
I
normalize
a
URL
in
python
.
For
example
","
If
I
have
a
url
string
like
:
""""
http://www.example.com/foo
goo
/
bar.html
""""
I
need
a
library
in
python
that
will
transform
the
extra
space
(
or
any
other
non
normalized
character
)
to
a
proper
URL
.
use
urllib.quote
or
urllib.quote_plus
From
the
urllib
documentation
:
"quote(string[, safe])"
Replace
special
characters
in
string
using
the
""""
%
xx
""""
escape
.
Letters
","
digits
","
and
the
characters
""""
_
.
-
""""
are
never
quoted
.
The
optional
safe
parameter
specifies
additional
characters
that
should
not
be
quoted
-
-
its
default
value
is
'
/
'
.
Example
:
quote('/~connolly/')
yields
'
/
%
7econnolly
/
'
.
"quote_plus(string[, safe])"
Like
quote()
","
but
also
replaces
spaces
by
plus
signs
","
as
required
for
quoting
HTML
form
values
.
Plus
signs
in
the
original
string
are
escaped
unless
they
are
included
in
safe
.
It
also
does
not
have
safe
default
to
'
/
'
.
EDIT
:
Using
urllib.quote
or
urllib.quote_plus
on
the
whole
URL
will
mangle
it
","
as
@ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ
points
out
:
@ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ
provides
a
function
that
uses
urlparse.urlparse
and
urlparse.urlunparse
to
parse
the
url
and
only
encode
the
path
.
This
may
be
more
useful
for
you
","
although
if
you're
building
the
URL
from
a
known
protocol
and
host
but
with
a
suspect
path
","
you
could
probably
do
just
as
well
to
avoid
urlparse
and
just
quote
the
suspect
part
of
the
URL
","
concatenating
with
known
safe
parts

Just
FYI
","
urlnorm
has
moved
to
github

encounter
such
an

*
[]
""""
)
do
help
","
but
it's
too
complicated
.
So
I
used
a
simple
way
:
url
=
"url.replace(' ', '%20')"
","
it's
not
perfect
","
but
it's
the
simplest
way
and
it
works
for
this
situation
.
Because
this
page
is
a
top
result
for
Google
searches
on
the
topic
","
I
think
it's
worth
mentioning
some
work
that
has
been
done
on
URL
normalization
with
Python
that
goes
beyond
urlencoding
space
characters
.
For
example
","
dealing
with
default
ports
","
character
case
","
lack
of
trailing
slashes
","
etc.
When
the
Atom
syndication
format
was
being
developed
","
there
was
some
discussion
on
how
to
normalize

into
canonical
format

this
is
documented
in
the
article
PaceCanonicalIds

That
article
provides
some
good
test
cases

I
believe
that
one
result
of
this
discussion
was
Mark
Nottingham's
urlnorm.py
library

I've
used

good
results

projects

That
script
doesn't
work
with
the
URL
given
in
this
question
","
however
.
So
a
better
choice
might
be
Sam
Ruby's
version
of
urlnorm.py

handles
that

all

to
move
them
around
)
.
PyPy
lets
different
types
have
different
kinds
of
id
","
but
the
most
general
is
just
an
index
into
a
table
of
objects
you've
called
id
on
","
which
is
obviously
not
going
to
be
a
pointer
.
I'm
not
sure
about
IronPython
","
but
I'd
suspect
it's
more
like
Jython
than
like
CPython
in
this
regard
.
So
","
in
most
Python
implementations
","
there's
no
way
to
get
whatever
showed
up
in
that
repr
","
and
no
use
if
you
did
.
But
what
if
you
only
care
about
CPython
?
That's
a
pretty
common
case
","
after
all
.
Well
","
first
","
you
may
notice
that
id
is
an
integer
;
*
if
you
want
that
0x2aba1c0cf890
string
instead
of
the
number
46978822895760
","
you're
going
to
have
to
format
it
yourself
.
Under
the
covers
","
I
believe
object.__repr__
is
ultimately
using
printf's
%
p
format
","
which
you
don't
have
from
Python
…
but
you
can
always
do
this
:
*
In
3.x
","
it's
an
int
.
In
2.x
","
it's
an
int
if
that's
big
enough
to
hold
a
pointer—which
is
may
not
be
because
of
signed
number
issues
on
some
platforms—and
a
long
otherwise
.
Is
there
anything
you
can
do
with
these
pointers
besides
print
them
out
?
Sure
(
again
","
assuming
you
only
care
about
CPython
)
.
All
of
the
C
API
functions
take
a
pointer
to
a
PyObject
or
a
related
type
.
For
those
related
types
","
you
can
just
call
PyFoo_Check
to
make
sure
it
really
is
a
Foo
object
","
then
cast
with
(
PyFoo
*
)
p
.
So
","
if
you're
writing
a
C
extension
","
the
id
is
exactly
what
you
need
.
What
if
you're
writing
pure
Python
code
?
You
can
call
the
exact
same
functions
with
pythonapi
from
ctypes
.
Finally
","
a
few
of
the
other
answers
have
brought
up
ctypes.addressof
.
That
isn't
relevant
here
.
This
only
works
for
ctypes
objects
like
c_int32
(
and
maybe
a
few
memory-buffer-like
objects
","
like
those
provided
by
numpy
)
.
And
","
even
there
","
it
isn't
giving
you
the
address
of
the
c_int32
value
","
it's
giving
you
the
address
of
the
C-level
int32
that
the
c_int32
wraps
up
.
That
being
said
","
more
often
than
not
","
if
you
really
think
you
need
the
address
of
something
","
you
didn't
want
a
native
Python
object
in
the
first
place
","
you
wanted
a
ctypes
object
.
With
ctypes
","
you
can
achieve
the
same
thing
with
Documentation
:
addressof(C instance)
->
integer
Return
the
address
of
the
C
instance
internal
buffer
Note
that
in
CPython
","
currently
id(a)
=
=
ctypes.addressof(a)
","
but
ctypes.addressof
should
return
the
real
address
for
each
Python
implementation
","
if
ctypes
is
supported
memory
pointers
are
a
valid
notion
.
Edit
:
added
information
about
interpreter-independence
of
ctypes
Just
use
You
can
get
something
suitable
for
that
purpose
with
:
While
it's
true
that
id(object)
gets
the
object's
address
in
the
default
CPython
implementation
","
this
is
generally
useless
...
you
can't
do
anything
with
the
address
from
pure
Python
code
.
The
only
time
you
would
actually
be
able
to
use
the
address
is
from
a
C
extension
library
...
in
which
case
it
is
trivial
to
get
the
object's
address
since
Python
objects
are
always
passed
around
as
C
pointers
.
The
Python
manual
has
this
to
say
about
id()
:
Return
the
`
`
identity
'
'
of
an
object
.
This
is
an
integer
(
or
long
integer
)
which
is
guaranteed
to
be
unique
and
constant
for
this
object
during
its
lifetime
.
Two
objects
with
non-overlapping
lifetimes
may
have
the
same
id()
value
.
(
Implementation
note
:
this
is
the
address
of
the
object
.
)
So
in
CPython
","
this
will
be
the
address
of
the
object
.
No
such
guarantee
for
any
other
Python
interpreter
","
though
.
Note
that
if
you're
writing
a
C
extension
","
you
have
full
access
to
the
internals
of
the
Python
interpreter
","
including
access
to
the
addresses
of
objects
directly
.
Just
in
response
to
Torsten
","
I
wasn't
able
to
call
addressof()
on
a
regular
python
object
.
Furthermore
","
id(a)

=
addressof(a)

This
is

I'm

Django
1.0

As

I'll
be
changing
the
DEBUG
setting

False
.
With
that
being
said
","
I'd
still
like
to
include
the
stacktrace

my
500.html

errors
occur
.
By
doing
so
","
users
can
copy-and-paste
the
errors

easily
email
them
to
the
developers
.
Any
thoughts
on
how
best
to
approach
this
issue
?
I
know
this
is
an
old
question
","
but
these
days
I
would
recommend
using
a
service
such
as
Sentry
to
capture
your
errors
.
On
Django
","
the
steps
to
set
this
up
are
incredibly
simple
.
From
the
docs
:
Install
Raven
using
pip
install
raven
Add
'
raven.contrib.django.raven_compat
'
to
your

Add
RAVEN_CONFIG
=
{
""""
dsn
""""
:

your

Then
","
on
your

page
(
defined
in

","
pass
the
request.sentry.id
to
the
template
and
your
users
can
reference
the
specific
error
without
any
of
your
internals

If
we
want
to
show
exceptions

are
generated

on
ur
template(500.html)

we
could
write

Automatically
log
your
500s
","
that
way
:
You
know
when
they
occur
.
You
don't
need
to
rely
on
users
sending
you
stacktraces
.
Joel
recommends
even
going
so
far
as
automatically
creating
tickets
in
your
bug
tracker
when
your
application
experiences
a
failure
.
Personally
","
I
create
a
(
private
)
RSS
feed
with
the
stacktraces
","
urls
","
etc.
that
the
developers
can
subscribe
to
.
Showing
stack
traces
to
your
users
on
the
other
hand
could
possibly
leak
information
that
malicious
users
could
use
to
attack
your
site
.
Overly
detailed
error
messages
are
one
of
the
classic
stepping
stones
to
SQL
injection
attacks
.
Edit
(
added
code
sample
to
capture
traceback
)
:
You
can
get
the
exception
information
from
the
sys.exc_info
call
.
While
formatting
the
traceback
for
display
comes
from
the
traceback
module
:
Prints
:
As
@zacherates
says
","
you
really
don't
want
to
display
a
stacktrace
to
your
users
.
The
easiest
approach
to
this
problem
is
what
Django
does
by
default
if
you
have
yourself
and
your
developers
listed
in
the
ADMINS
setting
with
email
addresses
;
it
sends
an
email
to
everyone
in
that
list
with
the
full
stack
trace
(
and
more
)
everytime
there
is
a
500
error
with
DEBUG
=
False
.
You
could
call
sys.exc_info()
in
a
custom
exception
handler
.
But
I
don't
recommend
that
.
Django
can
send
you
emails
for
exceptions
.
I
will
forgo
the
simplest
solutions
using
the
'
random
'
module
since
I
take
it
that's
not
really
what
you
are
after
.
Here's
what
I
think
you
are
looking
for
in

why
?
Yesterday
","
I
asked
this
question
and
never
really
got
an
answer
I
was
really
happy
with
.
I
really
would
like
to
know
how
to
generate
a
list
of
N
unique
random
numbers
using
a
functional
language
such
as
Ruby
without
having
to
be
extremely
imperative
in
style
.
Since
I
didn't
see
anything
I
really
liked
","
I've
written
the
solution
I
was
looking
for
in
LINQ
:
Can
you
translate
my
LINQ
to
Ruby
?
Python
?
Any
other
functional
programming
language
?
Note
:
Please
try
not
to
use
too
many
loops
and
conditionals
-
otherwise
the
solution
is
trivial
.
Also
","
I'd
rather
see
a
solution
where
you
don't
have
to
generate
an
array
much
bigger
than
N
so
you
can
then
just
remove
the
duplicates
and
trim
it
down
to
N
.
I
know
I'm
being
picky
","
but
I'd
really
like
to
see
some
elegant
solutions
to
this
problem
.
Thanks

Edit
:
Why
all
the
downvotes
?
Originally
my
code
sample
had
the
Distinct()
after
the
Take()
which
","
as
many
pointed
out
","
could
leave
me
with
an
empty
list
.
I've
changed
the
order
in
which
those
methods
are
called
to
reflect
what
I
meant
in
the
first
place
.
Apology
:
I've
been
told
this
post
came
across
as
rather
snobbish
.
I
wasn't
trying
to
imply
that
LINQ
is
better
than
Ruby
/
Python
;
or
that
my
solution
is
much
better
than
everyone
else's
.
My
intent
is
just
to
learn
how
to
do
this
(
with
certain
constraints
)
in
Ruby
.
I'm
sorry
if
I
came
across
as
a
jerk
.
Here's
another
Ruby
solution
:
I
think
","
with
your
LINQ
statement
","
the
Distinct
will
remove
duplicates
after
5
have
already
been
taken
","
so
you
aren't
guaranteed
to
get
5
back
.
Someone
can
correct
me
if
I'm
wrong
","
though
.
EDIT
:
Ok
","
just
for
fun
","
a
shorter
and
faster
one
(
and
still
using
iterators
)
.
Yeah
","
I
know
","
one-liners
should
be
left
to
perl
lovers
","
but
I
think
this
one
is
quite
powerful
isn't
it
?
Old
message
here
:
My
god
","
how
complicated

all
that
!
Let's
be
pythonic
:
Enjoy
EDIT
:
As
commentators
noticed
","
this
is
an
exact
translation
of
the
question's
code
.
To
avoid
the
problem
we
got
by
removing
duplicates
after
generating
the
list
","
resulting
in
too
little
data
","
you
can
choose
another
way
:
Here's
a
transliteration
from
your
solution
to
Python
.
First
","
a
generator
that
creates
Random
numbers
.
This
isn't
very
Pythonic
","
but
it's
a
good
match
with
your
sample
code
.
Here's
a
client
loop
that
collects
a
set
of
5
distinct
values
.
This
is
-
-
again
-
-
not
the
most
Pythonic
implementation
.
It's
not
clear
why
you
want
to
use
a
generator
for
random
numbers
-
-
that's
one
of
the
few
things
that's
so
simple
that
a
generator
doesn't
simplify
it
.
A
more
Pythonic
version
might
be
something
like
:
If
the
requirements
are
to
generate
5
values
and
find
distinct
among
those
5
","
then
something
like
I
can't
really
read
your
LINQ
","
but
I
think
you're
trying
to
get
5
random
numbers
up
to
100
and
then
remove
duplicates
.
Here's
a
solution
for
that
:
But
perhaps
you're
actually
looking
for
5
distinct
random
numbers
between
0
and
100
.
In
which
case
:
Now
","
this
one
might
violate
your
sense
of
""""
not
too
many
loops
","
""""
but
presumably
Take
and
Distinct
are
just
hiding
the
looping
from
you
.
It
would
be
easy
enough
to
just
add
methods
to
Enumerable
to
hide
the
while
loop
.
Maybe
this
will
suit
your
needs
and
look
a
bit
more
linqish
:
Here's
another
python
version
","
more
closely
matching
the
structure
of
your
C
#
code
.
There
isn't
a
builtin
for
giving
distinct
results
","
so
I've
added
a
function
to
do
this
.

This

used
for

Well
","
first
you
rewrite
LINQ
in
Python
.
Then
your
solution
is
a
one-liner
:
)
If
you
put
all
the
simple
methods
above
into
a
module
called
LINQ.py
","
you
can
impress
your
friends
.
(
Disclaimer
:
of
course
","
this
is
not
actually
rewriting
LINQ
in
Python
.
People
have
the
misconception
that
LINQ
is
just
a
bunch
of
trivial
extension
methods
and
some
new
syntax
.
The
really
advanced
part
of
LINQ
","
however
","
is
automatic
SQL
generation
so
that
when
you're
querying
a
database
","
it's
the
database
that
implements
Distinct()
rather
than
the
client
side
.
)
Yeah
","
it's
kind
of
annoying
.
Perhaps
this
will
work
for
your
case
.
EDIT
:
Brian
correctly
pointed
out
that
my
first
attempt
did
not
work
.
Unfortunately
","
this
attempt
is
longer
.
My
solution
would
be
:
I'd
suggest
this
","
as
it
uses
the
least
regex
to
accomplish
your
goal
.
It
is
still
functional
code
","
but
no
worse
then
your
old
Perl
.
Alternatively
","
something
not
using
regular
expressions
at
all
:
Whether
that
is
suitable
depends
on
your
actual
problem
.
Don't
forget
","
regular
expressions
aren't
the
swiss
army
knife
that
they
are
in
Perl
;
Python
has
different
constructs
for
doing
string
manipulation
.
Using
named
groups
and
a
dispatch
table
:
With
a
little
bit
of
introspection
you
can
auto-generate
the
regexp
and
the
dispatch
table
.
For
example
:
To
speed
it
up
","
one
could
turn
all
regexes
into
one
internally
and
create
the
dispatcher
on
the
fly
.
Ideally
","
this
would
be
turned
into
a
class
then
.
Expanding
on
the
solution
by
Pat
Notz
a
bit
","
I
found
it
even
the
more
elegant
to
:
-
name
the
methods
the
same
as
re
provides
(
e.g
.
search()
vs
.
check()
)
and
-
implement
the
necessary
methods
like
group()
on
the
holder
object
itself
:
Example
Instead
of
e.g
.
this
:
One
does
just
this
:
Looks
very
natural
in
the
end
","
does
not
need
too
many
code
changes
when
moving
from
Perl
and
avoids
the
problems
with
global
state
like
some
other
solutions
.
how
about
using
a
dictionary
?
however
","
you
must
ensure
there
are
no
duplicate
match_objects
dictionary
keys
(
mo_foo
","
mo_bar
","
...
)
","
best
by
giving
each
regular
expression
its
own
name
and
naming
the
match_objects
keys
accordingly
","
otherwise
match_objects.setdefault()
method
would
return
existing
match
object
instead
of
creating
new
match
object
by
running
re_xxx.search( text )
.
Here's
the
way
I
solved
this
issue
:
Not
nearly
as
clean
as
the
original
pattern
.
However
","
it
is
simple
","
straightforward
and
doesn't
require
extra
modules
or
that
you
change
the
original
regexs
.
Here
is
a
RegexDispatcher
class
that
dispatches
its
subclass
methods
by
regular
expression
.
Each
dispatchable
method
is
annotated
with
a
regular
expression
e.g
.
In
this
case
","
the
annotation
is
called
'
regex
'
and
its
value
is
the
regular
expression
to
match
on
","
'
\
+
'
","
which
is
the
+
sign
.
These
annotated
methods
are
put
in
subclasses
","
not
in
the
base
class
.
When
the
dispatch(...)
method
is
called
on
a
string
","
the
class
finds
the
method
with
an
annotation
regular
expression
that
matches
the
string
and
calls
it
.
Here
is
the
class
:
To
use
this
class
","
subclass
it
to
create
a
class
with
annotated
methods
.
By
way
of
example
","
here
is
a
simple
RPNCalculator
that
inherits
from
RegexDispatcher
.
The
methods
to
be
dispatched
are
(
of
course
)
the
ones
with
the
'
regex
'
annotation
.
The
parent
dispatch()
method
is
invoked
in
call
.
I
like
this
solution
because
there
are
no
separate
lookup
tables
.
The
regular
expression
to
match
on
is
embedded
in
the
method
to
be
called
as
an
annotation
.
For
me
","
this
is
as
it
should
be
.
It
would
be
nice
if
Python
allowed
more
flexible
annotations
","
because
I
would
rather
put
the
regex
annotation
on
the
method
itself
rather
than
embed
it
in
the
method
parameter
list
.
However
","
this
isn't
possible
at
the
moment
.
For
interest
","
take
a
look
at
the
Wolfram
language
in
which
functions
are
polymorphic
on
arbitrary
patterns
","
not
just
on
argument
types
.
A
function
that
is
polymorphic
on
a
regex
is
a
very
powerful
idea
","
but
we
can't
get
there
cleanly
in
Python
.
The
RegexDispatcher
class
is
the
best
I
could
do
.
I
switched
from
Perl
to
Python
about
a
year
ago
and
haven't
looked
back
.
There
is
only
one
idiom
that
I've
ever
found
I
can
do
more
easily
in
Perl
than
in
Python
:
The
corresponding
Python
code
is
not
so
elegant
since
the
if
statements
keep
getting
nested
:
Does
anyone
have
an
elegant
way
to
reproduce
this
pattern
in
Python
?
I've
seen
anonymous
function
dispatch
tables
used
","
but
those
seem
kind
of
unwieldy
to
me
for
a
small
number
of
regular
expressions
...

site-packages

Alas
","
I
have
no
better
solution
either
.
Python
doesn't
seem
to
keep
track
of
site-packages
directories
","
just
the
packages
within
them
.
This
is
what
worked
for
me
:
The
native
system
packages
installed
with
python

be
found

Or
one
can
simply
write
the
following
command
to
list
all
paths

packages
are

There
are
two
types

site-packages
directories

An
additional
note
to
the

or
block
devices
and
pipes
cannot
be
copied
with
this
function
.
src
and
dst
are
path
names
given
as
strings
.
Look
at
module
shutil
.
It
contains
function
"copyfile(src, dst)"
I
suggest
using
Swati's
answer
","
but
supposing
you
have
a
text
file
and
don't
want
to
use
additional
libraries
in
your
code
just
to
copy
it
","
you
can
use
the
following
one-liner
:
For
large
files
","
what
I
did
was
read
the
file
line
by
line
and
read
each
line
into
an
array
.
Then
","
once
the
array
reached
a
certain
size
","
append
it
to
a
new
file
.
"copy2(src,dst)"
is
often
more
useful
than
"copyfile(src,dst)"
because
:
it
allows
dst
to
be
a
directory
(
instead
of
the
complete
target
filename
)
","
in
which
case
the
basename
of
src
is
used
for
creating
the
new
file
;
it
preserves
the
original
modification
and
access
info
(
mtime
and
atime
)
in
the
file
metadata
(
however
","
this
comes
with
a
slight
overhead
)
.
Here
is
a
short
example

use

Example
:
Copying
a
file
is
a
relatively
straightforward
operation
as
shown
by
the
examples
below
","
but
you
should
instead
use
the
shutil
stdlib
module
for
that
.
If
you
want
to
copy
by
filename
you
could
do
something
like
this
:
Use
the
shutil
module
.
Copy
the
contents
of
the
file
named
src
to
a
file
named
dst
.
The
destination
location
must
be
writable
;
otherwise
","
an
IOError
exception
will
be
raised
.
If
dst
already
exists
","
it
will
be
replaced
.
Special
files
such
as
character
or
block
devices
and
pipes
cannot
be
copied
with
this
function
.
src
and
dst
are
path
names
given
as
strings
.
Take
a
look
at
filesys
for
all
the
file
and
directory
handling
functions
available
in
standard
Python
modules
.
Additional
information
about
Apache
/
mod_wsgi
and
access
","
authentication
and
authorization
mechanisms
can
be
found
in
:
http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/AccessControlMechanisms
The
information
isn't
passed
by
default
because
doing
so
could
leak
password
information
to
applications
which
maybe
shouldn't
get
it
.
I've
got
the
directive
I'd
like
to
know
in
the
/
some
/
script.wsgi
What
user
is
logged
in
.
How
do
I
do
that
?
add
WSGIPassAuthorization
On
:
Then
just
read
environ
[
'
REMOTE_USER
'
]
:
More
information
at
mod_wsgi
documentation
.
This
also
does
the
trick
for
me
:
Here
is
a
demonstration
in
python
shell
:
Getting
the
environment
variable
PWD
didn't
always
work
for
me
so
I
use
the
popen
method
.
Cheers
!
In
python
is
it
possible
to
get
or
set
a
logical
directory
(
as
opposed
to
an
absolute
one
)
.
For
example
if
I
have
:
and
I
have
linked
to
the
same
directory
.
using
os.getcwd
and
os.chdir
will
always
use
the
absolute
path
The
only
way
I
have
found
to
get
around
this
at
all
is
to
launch
'
pwd
'
in
another
process
and
read
the
output
.
However
","
this
only
works
until
you
call
os.chdir
for
the
first
time
.
The
underlying
operational
system
/
shell
reports
real
paths
to
python
.
So
","
there
really
is
no
way
around
it
","
since
os.getcwd()
is
a
wrapped
call
to
C
Library
getcwd()
function
.
There
are
some
workarounds
in
the
spirit
of
the
one
that
you
already
know
which
is
launching
pwd
.
Another
one
would
involve
using
os.environ
[
'
PWD
'
]
.
If
that
environmnent
variable
is
set
you
can
make
some
getcwd
function
that
respects
it
.
The
solution
below
combines
both
:
By
""""
separate
apps
within
Django
""""
do
you
mean
separate
applications
with
a
common
settings
?
That
is
to
say
","
two
applications
within
the
same
Django
site
(
or
project
)
?
If
so
","
the
{
%
url
%
}
tag
will
generate
a
proper
absolute
URL
to
any
of
the
apps
listed
in
the
settings
file
.
If
there
are
separate
Django
servers
with
separate
settings
","
you
have
the
standard
internet
problem
of
URI
design
.
Your
URI's
can
be
consistent
with
only
the
hostname
changing
.
You
never
need
to
provide
the
host
information
","
so
all
of
your
links
are
<
A
HREF
=
""""
/
some
/
path
/
""""
>
.
This
","
generally
","
works
out
the
best
.
You
have
can
someone's
random
laptop
being
a
test
server
;
you
can
get
the
IP
address
using
ifconfig
.
I
am
trying
to
mock-up
an
API
and
am
using
separate
apps
within
Django
to
represent
different
web
services
.
I
would
like
App
A
to
take
in
a
link
that
corresponds
to
App
B
and
parse
the
json
response
.
Is
there
a
way
to
dynamically
construct
the
url
to
App
B
so
that
I
can
test
the
code
in
development
and
not
change
to
much
before
going
into
production
?
The
problem
is
that
I
can't
use
localhost
as
part
of
a
link
.
I
am
currently
using
urllib
","
but
eventually
I
would
like
to
do
something
less
hacky
and
better
fitting
with
the
web
services
REST
paradigm
.
You
could
do
something
like
and
use
other
to
build
the
external
URL
.
Generally
you
code
in
DEBUG
mode
and
deploy
in
non-DEBUG
mode
.
settings.DEBUG
is
a

Wide

Results
The
better
regex
implementation
of
perl
is
one
part
of
the
story
.
That
can't
explain
however
why
the
perl
implementation
scales
better
.
The
difference
become
bigger
with
more
processors
.
For
some
reason
the
python
implementation
has
an
issue
there
.
The
Perl
implementation
uses
the
mmap
system
call
.
What
that
call
does
is
establish
a
pointer
which
to
the
process
appears
to
be
a
normal
segment
of
memory
or
buffer
to
the
program
.
It
maps
the
contents
of
a
file
to
a
region
of
memory
.
There
are
performances
advantages
of
doing
this
vs
normal
file
IO
(
read
)
-
one
is
that
there
are
no
user-space
library
calls
necessary
to
get
access
to
the
data
","
another
is
that
there
are
often
less
copy
operations
necessary
(
eg
:
moving
data
between
kernel
and
user
space
)
.
Perl's
strings
and
regular
expressions
are
8-bit
byte
based
(
as
opposed
to
utf16
for
Java
for
example
)
","
so
Perl's
native
'
character
type
'
is
the
same
encoding
of
the
mmapped
file
.
When
the
regular
expression
engine
then
operates
on
the
mmap
backed
variable
","
it
is
directly
accessing
the
file
data
via
the
mamped
memory
region
-
without
going
through
Perl's
IO
functions
","
or
even
libc's
IO
functions
.
The
mmap
is
probably
largely
responsible
for
the
performance
difference
vs
the
Python
version
using
the
normal
Python
IO
libraries
-
which
additionally
introduce
the
overhead
of
looking
for
line
breaks
.
The
Perl
program
also
supports
a
-
J
to
parallelize
the
processing
","
where
the
oepen
""""
-
|
""""
causes
a
fork()
where
the
file
handle
in
the
parent
is
to
the
child's
stdout
.
The
child
processes
serialize
their
results
to
stdout
and
the
parent
de-serializes
them
to
coordinate
and
summarize
the
results
.
Perl
is
heavily
optimized
for
text
processing
.
There
are
so
many
factors
that
it's
hard
to
say
what's
the
exact
difference
.
Text
is
represented
completely
differently
internally
(
utf-8
versus
utf-16
/
utf-32
)
and
the
regular
expression
engines
are
completely
different
too
.
Python's
regular
expression
engine
is
a
custom
one
and
not
as
much
used
as
the
perl
one
.
There
are
very
few
developers
working
on
it
(
I
think
it's
largely
unmaintained
)
in
contrast
to
the
Perl
one
which
is
basically
the
""""
core
of
the
language
""""
.
After
all
Perl
is
the
text
processing
language
.
IMO
python's
regexing
","
esp
.
when
you
try
to
represent
something
like
perl's
/
e
operator
as
in
s
/
whatever
/
somethingelse
/
e
","
becomes
quite
slow
.
So
in
doubt
","
you
may
need
to
stay
with
Perl5
:
-

Python
has
a
major
advantage
of
being
available
in
a
production-ready
format
today
.
Python
has
Jython
and
IronPython
","
if
you
need
to
work
closely
with
Java
or
the
.
net
clr
.
Perl
6
has
the
advantages
of
being
based
on
the
same
principles
as
Perl
(
1-5
)
;
If
you
like
Perl
","
you'll
like
Perl

for
the
same
reasons
.
(
There's
more
than
one
way

do
it
","
etc.
)
Perl
6
also
has
an
advantage
of
being
only
partially
implemented
:
If
you

David
Beazley
The
Python
list
comprehension
syntax
makes
it
easy
to
filter
values
within
a
comprehension
.
For
example
:
Will
return
a
list
of
the
squares
of
integers
in
mylist
.
However
","
what
if
the
test
involves
some
(
costly
)
computation
and
you
want
to
filter
on
the
result
?
One
option
is
:
This
will
result
in
a
list
of
"non-""false"
""""
expensive(x)
values
","
however
expensive()
is
called
twice
for
each
x
.
Is
there
a
comprehension
syntax
that
allows
you
to
do
this
test
while
only
calling
expensive
once
per
x
?
Came
up
with
my
own
answer
after
a
minute
of
thought
.
It
can
be
done
with
nested
comprehensions
:
I
guess
that
works
","
though
I
find
nested
comprehensions
are
only
marginally
readable
You
could
memoize
expensive(x)
(
and
if
you
are
calling
expensive(x)
frequently
","
you
probably
should
memoize
it
any
way
.
This
page
gives
an
implementation
of
memoize
for
python
:
http://code.activestate.com/recipes/52201/
This
has
the
added
benefit
that
expensive(x)
may
be
run
less
than
N
times
","
since
any
duplicate
entries
will
make
use
of
the
memo
from
the
previous
execution
.
Note
that
this
assumes
expensive(x)
is
a
true
function
","
and
does
not
depend
on
external
state
that
may
change
.
If
expensive(x)
does
depend
on
external
state
","
and
you
can
detect
when
that
state
changes
","
or
you
know
it
wont
change
during
your
list
comprehension
","
then
you
can
reset
the
memos
before
the
comprehension
.
You
could
always
memoize
the
expensive()
function
so
that
calling
it
the
second
time
around
is
merely
a
lookup
for
the
computed
value
of
x
.
Here's
just
one
of
many
implementations
of
memoize
as
a
decorator
.
map()
will
return
a
list
of
the
values
of

you
can
list-comprehend
that

discard
unnecessary
values

This
is
somewhat
like
a
nested
comprehension
","
but
should
be
faster
(
since
the
python
interpreter
can
optimize
it
fairly
easily

I
will
have
a
preference

This
has
the
advantage

:
http://bugs.python.org/issue2186

There
is
the

As
far
as
I
can
tell
","
the
method
described
in
the
question
is
the
only
way
to
pass
build
variables
to
a
Python
script
.
Perhaps
Visual
Studio
2010
has
something
better
?
This
is
a
bit
hacky
","
but
it
could
work
.
Why
not
call
multiple
.
py
scripts
in
a
row

Each
scripts
can
pass
in
a
small
subset
of
the
parameters
","
and
the
values
to
a
temp
text
file
.
The
final
script
will
read
and
work
off
of
the
temp
text
file
.
I
agree
that
this
method
is
filled
with
danger
and
WTF's
","
but
sometimes
you
have
to
just
hack
stuff
together
.
You
might
want
to
look
into
PropertySheets
.
These
are
files
containing
Visual
C
+
+
settings
","
including
user
macros
.
The
sheets
can
inherit
from
other
sheets
and
are
attached
to
VC
+
+
projects
using
the
PropertyManager
View
in
Visual
Studio
.
When
you
create
one
of
these
sheets
","
there
is
an
interface
for
creating
user
macros
.
When
you
add
a
macro
using
this
mechanism
","
there
is
a
checkbox
for
setting
the
user
macro
as
an
environment
variable
.
We
use
this
type
of
mechanism
in
our
build
system
to
rapidly
set
up
projects
to
perform
out-of-place
builds
.
Our
various
build
directories
are
all
defined
as
user
macros
.
I
have
not
actually
verified
that
the
environment
variables
are
set
in
an
external
script
called
from
post-build
.
I
tend
to
use
these
macros
as
command
line
arguments
to
my
post-build
scripts

but
I
would
expect
accessing
them

work

As
Brian
mentions
","
user-defined
Macros
can
be
defined
such
as
to
be
set
in
the
environment
in
which
build
tasks
execute
.
My
problem
is
with
the
built-in
Macros
.
I
use
a
Visual
Studio
Post-Build
Event
to
run
a
python
script
as
part
of
my
build
process
.
I'd
like
to
pass
the
entire
set
of
Macros
(
built-in
and
user-defined
)
to
my
script
in
the
environment
but
I
don't
know
how
.
Within
my
script
I
can
access
regular
environment
variables
(
e.g
.
","
Path
","
SystemRoot
)
but
NOT
these
""""
Macros
""""
.
All
I
can
do
now
is
pass
them
on-by-one
as
named
options
which
I
then
process
within
my
script
.
For
example
","
this
is
what
my
Post-Build
Event
command
line
looks
like
:
postbuild.py
-
-
"t=""$(TargetPath"
)
""""
-
-
"c=""$(ConfigurationName"
)
""""
Besides
being
a
pain
in
the
neck
","
there
is
a
limit
on
the
size
of
Post-Build
Event
command
line
so
I
can't
pass
dozens
Macros
using
this
method
even
if
I
wanted
to
because
the
command
line
is
truncated
.
Does
anyone
know
if
there
is
a
way
to
pass
the
entire
set
of
Macro
names
and
values
to
a
command
that
does
NOT
require
switching
to
MSBuild
(
which
I
believe
is
not
available
for
native
VC
+
+
)
or
some
other
make-like
build
tool

Like
so
:
Use
the
datetime.timedelta
class
:
Your
example
could
be
written
as
:

Compare
the
difference
to
a

you
create

Alternative
:
Assuming
self.timestamp

an
datetime
instance
You
can
subtract
two
datetime
objects

find
the
difference
between
them

You
can
use
datetime.fromtimestamp

I

figure
out
the

completely
answer

you

also

the
interest
of
saving
others
time
","
here's
what
I
did
to
implement
this
idea
:
A
variation
on
Jorenko's
work
above
allows
the
elevated
process
to
use
the
same
console
(
but
see
my
comment
below
)
:
It
seems
there's
no
way
to
elevate
the
application
privileges
for
a
while
for
you
to
perform
a
particular
task
.
Windows
needs
to
know
at
the
start
of
the
program
whether
the
application
requires
certain
privileges
","
and
will
ask
the
user
to
confirm
when
the
application
performs
any
tasks
that
need
those
privileges
.
There
are
two
ways
to
do
this
:
Write
a
manifest
file
that
tells
Windows
the
application
might
require
some
privileges
Run
the
application
with
elevated
privileges
from
inside
another
program
This
two
articles
explain
in
much
more
detail
how
this
works
.
What
I'd
do
","
if
you
don't
want
to
write
a
nasty
ctypes
wrapper
for
the
CreateElevatedProcess
API
","
is
use
the
ShellExecuteEx
trick
explained
in
the
Code
Project
article
(
Pywin32
comes
with
a
wrapper
for
ShellExecute
)
.
How
?
Something
like
this
:
When
your
program
starts
","
it
checks
if
it
has
Administrator
privileges
","
if
it
doesn't
it
runs
itself
using
the
ShellExecute
trick
and
exits
immediately
","
if
it
does
","
it
performs
the
task
at
hand
.
As
you
describe
your
program
as
a
""""
script
""""
","
I
suppose
that's
enough
for
your
needs
.
Cheers
.
As
of
2017
","
an
easy
method
to
achieve
this
is
the
following
:
Some
of
the
advantages
here
are
:
No
external
libraries
required
(
nor
Python
for
Windows
extension
)
.
It
only
uses
ctypes
from
standard
library
.
Works
on
both
Python
2
and
Python
3
.
There
is
no
need
to
modify
the
file
resources
nor
creating
a
manifest
file
.
If
you
don't
add
code
below
if
/
else
statement
","
the
code
won't
ever
be
executed
twice
.
You
can
easily
modify
it
to
have
a
special
behavior
if
the
user
reject
the
UAC
prompt
.
You
can
specify
arguments
modifying
the
fourth
parameter
.
You
can
specify
the
display
method
modifying
the
sixth
parameter
.

the
underlying
ShellExecute
call

I
think
a
more
elegant
solution
is
offered
on
github
by
frmdstryr
using
his
module
pyminutils
:
Excerpt
:
This
utilizes
the
COM
interface

automatically
indicates

dialog
prompt

you
would
see
if
you
were
copying

a
directory

admin
privileges

required

also
provides
the
typical
file
progress
dialog

the
copy
operation

I

If

""""

administator

then
run
my
script
","
it
works
fine
.
This
makes
sense
since
User
Account
Control

UAC
)
normally
prevents
many
file
system
actions

Is
there
a
way

","
from

invoke

something
like
""""

If

","
is
there
a
way
my

can
at

detect
that

You

make
a

the
target
use
:

under
properties

advanced
select
run

When
the
user
executes
the

it
will
ask
them

elevate

your
script
always
requires
an
Administrator's
privileges

keep
track

set
manually

The
publisher
handler
uses
this
flag
in
the
following
way
:
when
content_type
isn't
explicitly
set
","
it
attempts
to
guess
the

type
by
examining
the
first
few
bytes
of
the

If
you
just

have
pretty
xml
output

How
do

I
have
two
questions
regarding

using
WXAgg
backend
)

How

instead

me
clicking
on

to
maximize
it
each
time
?
2
-
)
I
have
two
screens
.
Interestingly
","
my
mpl
windows
tend
to
open
on
my
small
screen
.
How
can
I
force
mpl
/
ipython
/
WX
/
X-windows
to
open
mpl
windows
on
my
2nd

bigger
monitor
?
Thanks
.
Relative
to
your
first
question
","
you
can
use
Maximize
on
your
figure
manager
(
as
your
figure
manager
is
a
FigureManagerWx
instance
)
or
equivalent
methods
in
case
of
other
backends
:
For
the
second
question
","
I
am
not
sure
(
i
can
not
test
it
)
but
if
the
problem
can
be
solved
by
setting
the
position
of
your
figure
in
a
screen
extended
in
two
monitors
","
then
you
can
use
SetPosition
(
again
for
a
wxAgg
backend
)
:
We
have
a
dummy
Python
module
(
fields.py
)
with
custom
Django
fields
which
loads
real
implementations
based
on
the
database
configured
:
The
reason
for
this
is
that
we
are
using
PostgreSQL
ip4r
extension
which
allows
nice
(
and
fast
)
work
with
fields
containing
IP
values
.
But
we
also
have
dummy
implementations
(
in
Python
code
)
for
other
databases
","
so
that
development
can
be
done
also
in
SQLite
.
So
if
you
are
using
PostgreSQL
those
fields
are
backed
up
with
fields
using
ip4r
indexes
and
if
you
are
using
some
other
database
system
those
fields
are
regular
fields
.
The
problem
is
how
to
use
South
migrations
on
such
fields
.
The
problem
is
that
add_introspection_rules
discovers
fields_postgresql
and
fields_dummy
so
this
leaks
to
migrations
.
This
is
the
problem
later
on
if
you
want
to
apply
a
migration
made
with
SQLite
on
an
installation
with
PostgreSQL
.
How
it
would
be
possible
to
convince
South
that
this
is
all
just
fields
module
and
it
does
not
matter
which
concrete
implementation
migrations
are
run
with
.
Drop
support
for
SQLite
.
You
are
right
","
if
you
aren't
running
your
development
environment
on
a
mobile
phone
","
maintaining
your
very
own
South-based
migration
script
just
in
a
sake
of
not
installing
Postgre
probably
isn't
worth
the
hassle
.
Postgre
installation
versus
maintaining
custom
migration
code
is
a
one-time
action
versus
continuous
and
potentially
time-consuming
procedure
(
since
you
will
potentially
have
to
modify
your
custom
migration
code
in
order
to
be
in
sync
with
newer
South
releases
)
.
I
have
a
lxml
etree
HTMLParser

I
ran

the

has
either
single-quotes

I've
exhausted
all
my
options

Here's
a
sample

created

the
snippet
of
code

then
different
variations
of
the

being
read
in
self.text
is
basically
the
expected

in
this
case

this
fails
when
i
try
to
use
the
xpath

is
because
the

How
can
I
properly
escape
the

I've
tried
triple

or
doing
a
re.sub

string.replace
escaping

""""
with

'
and
\
""""
According
to
what
we
can
see
in
Wikipedia

w3
school

you
should
not
have

""""

even
if
only
<

They
should
be
replaced
by
corresponding
""""
predefined
entity
references
""""
","
that
are
&apos
;
and
&quot
;
.
By
the
way
","
the
Python
parsers
I
use
will
take
care
of
this
transparently
:
when
writing
","
they
are
replaced
;
when
reading
","
they
are
converted
.
After
a
second
reading
of
your
answer
","
I
tested
some
stuff
with
the
'
and
so
on
in
Python
interpreter
.
And
it
will
escape
everything
for
you
!
So
we
can
see
that
Python
escapes
things
correctly
.
Could
you
then
copy-paste
the
error

you
get

the
""""

'
'

what

It
seems
that
your
goal
is
not
to
decouple
the
database
from
the
MQ
","
but
rather
from
the
workers
.
As
such
","
you
can
create
another
queue
that
receives
completion
notifications
","
and
have
another
single
worker
that
picks
up
the
notifications
and
updates
the
database
appropriately
.
I
am
building
a
web
application
that
allows
a
user
to
upload
an
image

When
the
image
is
uploaded
","
it
needs
to
be
resized
to
one
or
more
sizes
","
each
of
which
needs
to
be
sent
to
Amazon
s3
for
storage
.
Metadata
and
urls
for
each
size
of
the
image
are
stored
in
a
single
database
record
on
the
web
server
.
I'm
using
a
message
queue
to
perform
the
resizing
and
uploading
asynchronously
(
as
there
is
potential
for
large
images
and
multiple
resizes
per
request
)

When
the
resize
/
upload
task
completes
","
the
database
record
needs
to
be
updated
with
the
url
.
My
problem
is
that
the
worker
executing
the
task
will
not
have
access
to
the
database
.
I
was
thinking
of
firing
off
a
http
callback
from
the
worker
back

the
web
application
after
the
task
is
complete
with
the
appropriate
information
for
updating
the
database
record

Are
there
any
other
alternatives

do
this

you
can
use
the
DeferredReflection
class
when
creating
your
declarative
base
to
delay
the
autoload
until
an
engine
is
attached
to
your

Just
write
an
appropriate
__lt__
method
for
the
objects
in
the
list
so
they
sort
correctly
:
Only
__lt__
is
needed
by
Python
for
sorting
","
though
it's
a
good
idea
to
define
all
of
the
comparisons
or
use
functools.total_ordering
.
You
can
see
that
it
is
working
by
using
two
items
with
the
same
first
value
and
different
second
values
.
The
two
objects
will
swap
places
when
you
heapify
no
matter
what
the
second
values
are
because
lst
[0]
<
lst
[1]
will
always
be
False
.
If
you
need
the
heapify
to
be
stable
","
you
need
a
more
complex
comparison
.
I'm
using
python2.6
.
Is
it
available
in
higher
version
of
python
?
Else
is
there
any
other
way
I
can
maintain
priority
queues
for
list
of
objects
of
non-trivial
classes
?
What
I
need
is
something
like
this
Any
suggestions
?
I
don't
know
if
this
is
better
but
it
is
like
Raymond
Hettinger's
solution
but
the
priority
is
determined
from
the
object
.
Let
this
be
your
object
and
you
want
to
sort
by
the
the
x
attribute
.
Then
have
a
function
which
applies
the
pairing
Then
apply
the
function
to
the
lists
as
input
into
heapq.merge
Which
gave
me
the
following
output
Well
","
this
is
terrible
and
awful
and
you
definitely
shouldn't
do
itâ
€
¦
But
it
looks
like
the
heapq
module
defines
a
cmp_lt
function
","
which
you
could
monkey
patch
if
you
really
wanted
a
custom
compare
function
.
The
traditional
solution
is
to
store
(
priority
","
task
)
tuples
on
the
heap
:
This
works
fine
as
long
as
no
two
tasks
have
the
same
priority
;
otherwise
","
the
tasks
themselves
are
compared
(
which
might
not
work
at
all
in
Python
3
)
.

","
there
is
no
module
that
will
run
within
your
python
program
and
do
this
conversion
.
But
I
see
the
problem
of
creating
a
XSD
schema
from
XML
as
a
tooling
problem
.
It's
the
kind
of
functionality
that
I'll
use
once
","
to
get
a
schema
started
but
after
that
I'll
be
maintaining
the
schema
myself
.
From
reading
a
single
XML
file
the
XSD
generator
will
create
a
starting
point
for
a
real
schema
","
it
cannot
infer
all
the
functionality
and
options
offered
by
XSD
.
Basically
","
I
don't
see
the
need
to
have
this
conversion
run
as
a
module
inside
of
my
code
","
generating
new
XSDs
every
time
the
XML
changes
.
After
all
","
it's
the
schema
that
defines
the
XML
not
the
other
way
around
.
As
end-user
pointed
out
you
could
use
xsd.exe
but
you
might
also
want
to
look
at
other
tools
such
as
trang
(
a
bit
old
)
for
Java
and
stylusstudio
(
XML
tool
)
.
I'm
looking
for
a
tool
that
will
play
nicely
with
Python
.
Except
for
my
Python
requirement
","
my
question
is
the
same
as
this
one
:
""""
I
am
looking
for
a
tool
which
will
take
an
XML
instance
document
and
output
a
corresponding
XSD
schema
.
""""
Are
you
looking
for
something
like
pyxsd
?
(
primarily
used
for
validation
against
a
schema
)
Or
maybe
PyXB
?
(
can
generate
classes
based
on
xml
)
Otherwise
","
I
don't
think
there's
a
tool
[yet]
that
will
generate
the
schema
from
within
Python
.
Can
you
do
it
on
demand
using
something
like
xsd.exe
?
Does
it
have
to
be
programmatic
/
repeatable
?
In
addition
","
the
contents
of
__init__.py
becomes
the
contents
of
the
package
when
treated
as
a
module
","
i.e.
the
contents
of
somepackage
/
__init__.py
will
be
found
in
dir(somepackage)
when
you
import somepackage
.
Modules
themselves
can
be
Python
code
","
specially-crafted
C
code
","
or
they
could
be
an
artificial
construct
injected
by
the
executable
that
loads
the
Python
VM
.
Here's
an
explanation
for
why
__init__.py
is
needed
:
The
__init__.py
files
are
required
to
make
Python
treat
the
directories
as
containing
packages
;
this
is
done
to
prevent
directories
with
a
common
name
","
such
as
string
","
from
unintentionally
hiding
valid
modules
that
occur
later
on
the
module
search
path
.
In
the
simplest
case
","
__init__.py
can
just
be
an
empty
file
","
but
it
can
also
execute
initialization
code
for
the
package
or
set
the
__all__
variable
","
described
later
.
As
I've
just
recommended
to
another
poster
","
the
tutorial
on
modules
is
pretty
informative
.
In
python
","
a
directory
containing
one
or
more
modules
sometimes
has
__init__.py
","
so
that
the
directory
can
be
treated
as
a
python
package
","
is
this
correct
?
What
differences
the
__init__
makes
?
(
also
another
Q
","
is
a
python
module
just
a
python
code-file
with
related
and
possibly
independent
(
to
other
files
)
set
of
classes
","
functions
and
variables
?
)
You
can
use
a
StringIO
file
object
instead

a
regular
file

well

both
PIL
Image.open

know

form

row

a
table

","
exactly
what
you
want
to

key-value

I

be
satisfied

a
simple
approach

finding

the
name

For
example
the
import step
name
for
plone.app.registry

is
managed
by
the
'
registry.xml
'

is
not
obvious

I
tried
to
refer
to
it

'
registry

this
fails

see
code
below

And
the
result
was
:
What
I
ended
up
doing
was
as
follows
:
go
into
the
plone
/
app
/
registry
/
exportimport
/
configure.zcml
file
where
the
name
was

as

Turns
out
the
name
of
the
import step
was
registered
as
'
plone.app.registry
'
So
basically
I
had
to
dig
into
the
code
to
find
out
where
the
importStep
was
registered
.

I

to
use

I'm
writing
a

issue
is
this

There
is
a
wysiwyg

A
change
done

reflect

the
other

One
option
is
to
use
the
setHtml
and
toHtml
functions
whenever
text
changes
in
a
qtextedit
.
But
the
issue
with
this
approach
is
that
when
I
use
setHtml
on
a
qtextedit
","
all
the
previous
edit
undo
history
is
lost

maintain

Consider
I
enter
a
sentence
","
textchanged
will
be
signaled
for
every
single
character

undo
would
be
character
by
character
.
I
tried
sharing
the
same
qtextdocument
between
the
two
qtextedits
but
that
also
failed
as
highlighting
is
linked
to
the
qtextdocument
and
hence
is
applied
to
both
qtextedits
.
Another
option
is
to
do
nothing
when
the
user
works
in
the
wysiwyg
editor
window
.
When
the
user
makes
some
edit
in
the
html
code
editor

I'll
wait
till
the
user
finishes
the
edit
and
then
once
done
","
I'll
find
the
diff
of
the
edit
and
somehow
","
make
a
corresponding
edit
change
in
the
wysiwyg
editor's
qtextdocument
.
Is
this
achievable
?
How
can
I
do
such
a
change
in
the
qtextdocument

Is
there
a
more
simple
way

the

convert
the

the

You
need
to
use
equations
7
through
9
in
combination
.
The
only
things
that
are
unknown
in
the
equations
are
the
Lagrange
multipliers
","
the
lambdas
.
Everything
else
depends
on
the
empirical
data
available
","
and
are
thus
just
numbers
.
Given
a
set
of
values
for
the
lambdas
","
you
can
calculate
the
"G(j,r)"
and
the
Jacobian
"J(j,i,r,s)"
.
In
turn
","
if
you
know
the
residuals
and
the
Jacobian
","
you
can
use
Newton's
method
","
given
in
equation
9
","
to
find
the
roots
of
the
system
of
equations
","
i.e.
","
those
values
of
lambda
such
that
"G(j,r)"
=
0
.
Thus
","
you
use
an
initial
guess
at
the
values
for
the
lambdas
to
calculate
the
other
terms
","
then
use
those
terms
to
update
your
guess
.
There's
no
conceptual
challenge
to
working
with
equation
7
and
8
at
all
-
-
just
plug
in
the
values
-
-
but
they
are
adding
up
a
lot
of
numbers
","
so
some
care
is
warranted
.
Equation
9
is
a
little
tricky
","
as
it's
not
written
very
clearly
.
Since
the
paper
describes
a
system
of
equations
","
you'd
generally
expect
to
solve
a
linear
equation
:
where
d_lambda
is
a
vector
of
changes
in
the
guess
","
G
is
a
vector
of
values
for
the
function
","
and
J
is
a
matrix
of
Jacobian
values
.
The
notation
in
the
paper
is
pretty
muddled
","
obscuring
what
should
be
a
simple
expression
.
You
can
get
it
into
a
clearer
form
by
introducing
a
unified
index
a
to
replace
the
pair
of
indices
i
and
s
;
the
authors
mention
just
this
change
in
the
discussion
of
the
method
","
giving
a
formula
for
calculating
the
combined
index
in
the
second
paragraph
on
page
4
.
Overall
","
the
procedure
becomes
(
using
the
unified
index
)
:
Choose
some
lambdas
to
act
as
your
initial
guess
.
Maybe
zeros
","
or
random
numbers
.
Evaluate
G(a)
and
"J(a,b)"
.
Solve
a
system
of
linear
equations
to
get
the
updates
to
your
guess
.
If
the
updates
are
small
compared
to
your
guess
","
stop
.
Otherwise
","
determine
the
new
guess
and
go
back
to
step
2
.
This
looks
quite
feasible
using
Numpy
.
The
paper
talked
about
using
a
parallel
computing
strategy
","
but
that
was

ten

Plotly
lets
you
make
graphs
using
their
online
Python
sandbox
.
Their
gallery
has
some
example
scientific
graphs
with
the
Python
scripts
that
generated
them
:
https://plot.ly/api/Python.
Here's
a
sample
from
the
gallery
:
You
may
want
to
give
details
on
the
types
of
charts
you
want
to
make
.
Simple
graphs
are
easy
with
sage
and
there
are
lots
of
options
as
compared
to
matlab
.
If
you
want
more
of
a
powerpoint
chart
","
or
picture
you
can
insert
into
a
word
doc
","
then
that's
a
little
different
.
If
you
can
get
something
to
create
chart
images
","
then
you
can
hook
it
into
a
python
web
framework
","
such
as
django
or
pylons
.
That
will
allow
you
to
set
up
a
loopback
server
to
host
the
page
on
your
machine
and
view
it
on
your
machine
.
This
is
quite
a
bit
more
complex
though
.
My
suggestion
is
to
break
your
program
down
into
pieces
.
It's
like
building
a
house
out
of
lego
brinks
.
You
have
an
idea
what
you
want
it
to
look
like
","
but
the
details
determine
everything
.
Break
it
down
into
the
smallest
pieces
you
can
","
and
define
larger
pieces
as
groups
of
smaller
pieces
The
house
is
just
several
rooms
.
A
room
is
just
4
walls
","
a
floor
and
a
ceiling
.
A
wall
is
just
several
boards
","
and
a
board
is
2x4
.
Once
you
break
all
the
parts
down
","
then
you'll
know
not
only
what
you
need
to
make
","
but
what
you
need
to
find
for
each
piece
.
You've
got
a
good
start
with
your
list
of
requirements
.
That
defines
what
you
want
your
program
to
do
.
Now
you
need
to
work
backwards
to
define
the
different
parts
.
Don't
get
hung
up
on
how
they
work
","
define
the
way
they
mesh
.
For
a
simple
python
script
to
create
a

server

content
.
By
plugging
that
into
a
""""
black
box
""""
that
produces
your
charts
","
you
suddenly
have
a
simple
working
setup
.
The
charts
section
doesn't
care
how
the
user
gets
them
","
it
just
makes
a
chart
and
passes
it
out
.
The
server
doesn't
care
how
the
chart
is
made
","
it
just
serves
it
up
.
This
section
of
the
sage
manual
has
instructions
for
saving
a
plot
after
you
create
it

has
become
a
mature

widely
used
graphing
package

As
for
your
interaction

a
web
browser

you
may
have
to
use
another
package
in
conjunction

I
suggest
CherryPy
because
it
is
simple
.
If
you
can
do
without
using
a
browser

Plotting

you
would
be
better
off

a
javascript-based
library
for
the
view

I
have
used
web2py
web
framework
before
along
with
protovis
.
But
a
simpler
web
framework
like
Bottle

CherryPy
can
also
be
used
to
pass
the
data

Bottle
has
a
Simple
Template
Engine

very
similar

what
I
used

Developing
in
two
languages

one

which
is
javascript

a
bit
of
a
pain

You

advice
would
be

Actually
what
you
are
looking
at
is
not
a
proxy
pattern

the
builder
pattern
","
and
yes
your
implementation
is
IMHO
is
the
classic
one
(
using
the
Fluent
interface
pattern
)
.
I
don't
know
what
SQLAlchemy
does
","
but
I
would
implement
the
interface
by
having
the
Session.query()
method
return
a
Query
object
with
methods
like
filter()
","
order_by()
","
all()
etc.
Each
of
these
methods
simply
returns
a
new
Query
object
taking
into
account
the
applied
changes
.
This
allows
for
method
chaining
as
in
your
first
example
.
Your
own
code
example
has
numerous
problems

One
example
I
find
it
very
interesting
the
way
how
SQLAlchemy
constructing
query
strings
","
eg
:
As
far
as
I
can
see
","
there
applied
some
kind
of
Proxy
Pattern
.
In
my
small
project
I
need
to
make
similar
string
construction
using
OOP
approach
.
So
","
I
tried
to
reconstitute
this
behavior
.
Firstly
","
some
kind
of
object
","
one
of
plenty
similar
objects
:
All
methods
of
this
object
return
self
","
so
I
can
call
them
in
any
order
and
unlimited
number
of
times
.
Secondly
","
proxy
object
","
that
will
call
subject's
methods
if
it's
not
a
perform
method
","
which
calls
object
to
see
the
resulting
string
.
And
finally
:
What
can
you
say
about
this
implementation
?
Is
there
better
ways
to
make
the
desirable
amount
of
classes
that
would
make
such
a
string
cunstructing
with
the
same
syntax
?

Similarly
it
has
a
results
queue
.
Each
worker
performs
its
job
by
querying
a
server
.
CPU
usage
by
the
workers
is
low
.
When
the
number
of
workers
grows
","
CPU
usage
on
the
servers
actually
shrinks
.
The
servers
themselves
are
not
the
bottleneck
","
as
I
can
load
them
up
further
from
other
applications
.
Anyone
else
seen
similar
behavior
?
Is
there
an
issue
with
python
multiprocessing
queues
when
a
large
number
of
processes
are
reading
or
writing
to
the
same
queues
?
Creating
of
new
thead
is
very
expensive
operation
.
One
of
the
simplest
ways
for
controling
a
lot
of
paralell
network
connections
is
to
use
stackless
threads
with
support
of
asyncronical
sockets
.
Python
had
great
support
and
a
bunch
of
libraries
for
that
.
My
favorite
one
is
gevent
","
which
has
a
great
and
comletely
transparent
monkey-patching
utility
.
Not
exactly
sure
what
is
going
on
unless
you
provide
all
the
details
.
However
","
remember
that
the
real
concurrency
is
bounded
by
the
actual
number
of
hardware
threads
.
If
the
number
of
processes
launched
is
much
larger
than
the
actual
number
of
hardware
threads
","
at
some
point
the
context-switching
overhead
will
be
more
than
the
benefit
of
having
more
concurrent
processes
.
Two
different
ideas
for
performance
constraints
:
The
bottleneck
is
the
workers
fighting
each
other
and
the
parent
for
access
to
the
job
queue
.
The
bottleneck
is
connection
rate-limits
(
syn-flood
protection
)
on
the
servers
.
Gathering
more
information
:
Profile
the
amount
of
work
done
:
tasks
completed
per
second
","
use
this
as
your
core
performance
metric
.
Use
packet
capture
to
view
the
network
activity
for
network-level
delays
.
Have
your
workers
document
how
long
they
wait
for
access
to
the
job
queue
.
Possible
improvements
:
Have
your
workers
use
persistent
connections
if
available
/
applicable
(
e.g
.
HTTP
)
.
Split
the
tasks
into
multiple
job
queues
fed
to
pools
of
workers
.
The
generic
attribute
getter
function
getattr
should
work
:
You
could
pass
the
name
of
the
attribute
:
or
a
getter
functor
:
I
prefer
the
latter
approach
as
it
is
more
generic
.
For
example
","
it
easily
allows
for
computed
keys
.
So
I
have
a
working
sorting
algorithm
in
Python
.
(
Its
exact
contents
are
irrelevant
to
this
question
.
)
It
uses
a
list
called
'
people
'
containing
class
instances
","
and
the
function
is
hard-coded
to
sort
that
list
by
a
specific
attribute
","
'
wealth
'
.
Now
","
I'd
like
to
generalize
the
function
so
I
could
sort
by
any
attribute
.
But
this
","
of
course
","
throws
an
error
","
because
it
doesn't
know
to
consider
'
wealth
'
as
a
class
attribute
.
So
","
how
is
this
possible
to
do
?
Create
a
file
called
config.py
and
paste
the
follwing
into
it
.
then
copy
this
code
in
a
file
called
config.xml
After
all
of
the
resources
defined
in
the
config.xml
file
","
simply
call
the
following
from
a
command
prompt

Make
sure
you
have
access
to
wsadmin

This
will
create
all
your

a
profile
called
MyProfile

Hope
it
helps

Python

case

a
negative
hex
value
(
-

have
an
infinite

The

Building

you'll
also
need
to
actually
do
something

Also
","
I'm
assuming
there
can
be
multiple
""""

If
that's
not
true

you
can

Look
at
two
ways

structuring
my
functions
:
Will
the
second
option
be
slower

I
only
need
to
call
myFunc

d
like
to

it

my
module
documentation

I
could
use
an
underscore
for
that
","
but
I
thought
it
would
be
cleaner
to
have
it
inside
the
function
.
On
the
other
hand
I
might
need
to
call
myFunc2
few
hundred
times
per
second
","
so
""""
redefining
""""
myFunc
when
calling
myFunc2
each
time
might
be
slow
...
is
that
a
good
guess
?
The
local
function
in
the
second

it

compiled
once
together
with
the
whole

its
body
is
stored
in
a
code
object
.
The
only
thing
that
happens
during
the
execution
of
the
outer
function
is
that
the
code
object
is
wrapped
in
a
new
function
object
which
is
then
bound
to
the
local
name
myFunc
.
There
might
be
a
difference
between
the
two
variants
if
myFunc()
takes
default
parameters
.
Their
definition
would
be
executed
over
and
over
again
in
the
second
variant
","
resulting
in
a
possible
performance
hit
.
Exaggerated
example
:
With
the
daft
code
above
","
myClass.myFunc2()
will
return
immediately

myClass2.myFunc2()

spec
file
:
The
problem
is
that
when
I
run
this
","
I
can
see
the
task
being
kicked
off
:
But
there
is
no
expected
list
of
files
being
copied
in
the
output
and
the
static
directory
isn't
actually
being
populated
.
So
the
questions
are
:
Is
there
anything
special
about
running
python
scripts
from
RPM
that
I
need
to
be
aware
of
I'm
using
-
vv
option
of
the
rpm
command
to
get
verbose
output
from
the
install
process
","
but
is
there
a
way
to
further
debug
what's
going
on
inside
of
rpm
once
the
python
script
gets
kicked
off
.
Thanks
D
.
I
ended
up
moving
the
scripts
from
%
post
to
%
build
.
That
took
care
of
the
issue
.
You
should
look
at
virtualenv
(
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv
)
","
and
then
have
your
rpm
bundle
the
entire
virtual
environment
","
along
with
the
site-packages
directory
","
so
the
eggs
you
need
will
be
available
on
the
deployed
system
","
and
that
the
eggs
will
be
at
the
version
your
script
requires
.
(
In
the
case
above
","
it
sounds
like
the
south
version
may
be
different
from
what
you
expect
)
.
Then
in
the
%
post
section
","
call
the
python
from
your
virtual
environment
instead
of
the
system
python
","
The
missing
egg
problem
will
be
pretty
easy
to
see
","
but
debugging
problems
due
to
differing
egg
versions
can
be
pretty
subtle
.

Here
is
a
solution
that
uses
a
metaclass

You
could
create
a
metaclass

adds
behavior

a

created

your

the

it

","
a
bit
surprised
not
to
find
an
answer
to
this
one
...
the
real-world
reason
for
my
asking
is
:
I
have
a
dictionary
of
constants
in
a
class
and
I
want
a
dictionary
so
I
can
find
the
constant
if
given
the
number
...
easy
enough
:
...
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
make
this
a
@static
method
of
MySQLConstants
and
call
it
by
going
MySQLConstants.createDic()
","
after
the
class
definition
statement
has
executed
...
but
I
was
just
wondering
whether
there's
any
way
to
get
a
method
","
inevitably
@static

To
answer
the
question
directly
","
yes
:
Notice
the
rewrite
of

","
in
particular
assigning
it
as
a
classmethod

calling
it
during

creation
.
If
this
is
a
one-shot
use
method
","
I
would
be
inclined
to
go
with
this
:
This
creates
all
the
names
","
and
creates
a
reverse
lookup
dictionary
","
in
one
nice
tidy
package
.
it
was
far
simpler
","

fact

using
a
Metaclass

no
""""

turns
out
to
be
needed

thanks
to
Ethan
Furman

showing
that
things
can
be
made
to

anticipate

the
best
way

From

have

How
can
I

it

I've
got
a
fairly
simple

All
my
other
Python

work
fine

This
error
doesn't
really
give
me
enough
context

even
know
where
to
look

Any
ideas
?
Even
just
a
way

get
some
actual
debug
info

be
appreciated
.
After
using
Skype4py

I
got
similar

Someone

it
didn't
help
much

And
the
weird
part
is
that
it
sometimes
works

I
tried
starting

sometimes
it

Steven

I
had
a

out

Might
not

And
just
a
few
hours

What

No
idea
what
that
is

where
it
comes
from

I
bet
it's
the
culprit

The
best-known

Instead
","
pass
an

i.e.
either
5000

both

Also
","
check
whether
a
firewall
between
the
computers

using
the
code

...
You're
doing
some
very
odd
things
here
.
Let's
go
through
a
few
of
them
.
1
-
name
=
jobs
[j]
[
'
Job_Name
'
]
[0]
It
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
jobs
is
a
container
of
dictionaries
","
which
have
a
key
'
Job_Name
'
","
and
that
key's
value
is
a
list
or
tuple
.
I
think
what
you
might
mean
is
:
name
=
j
[
'
Job_name
'
]
[0]
If
jobs
is
just
a
list
of
strings
","
being
job
names
","
all
you
need
is
this
:
name
=
j
","
which
you
can
just
skip
-
and
just
use
j
when
you
want
to
refer
to
it
.
2
-
"p=re.compile(""(\\w*):?\\w*-?\\d"
*
""""
)
You're
compiling
your
regex
every
time
you
go
through
the
loop
","
where
it
is
exactly
the
same
each
time
","
and
you
use
it
exactly
once
.
Do
this
compilation
before
the
loop
begins
.
3
-
You
don't
need
your
else
clause
at
all
.
And
if
you
want
""""
else
if
""""
in
Python
","
you
use
""""
elif
""""
.
4
-
Your
regex
could
be
simplified
by
using
a
raw
string
to
eliminate
all
the
double
escapes
:
"p=re.compile(r""(\w*):?\w*-?\d"
*
""""
)
5
-
Your
whole
regex
may
be
unnecessary
.
If
you're
doing
what
I
think
you're
doing
","
you
just
want
what
appears
before
the
first
colon
","
if
there
is
one
.
(
Unless
you
really
mean
group(1)
","
which
I
think
you
don't
.
)
Which
means
you
could
skip
the
regex
(
since
you're
matching
with
in
anyhow
)
","
and
just
use
something
like
name
=
name.split(':')
[0]
The
match()
won't
""""
interfere
""""
with
an
else-clause
.
The
most
likely
cause
here
is
that
the
name==job
condition
is
failing
for
one
of
your
test
cases
.
A
judicious
use
of
print-statements
will
likely
will
show
which
string
is
skipped
.
Or
you
an
use
pdb
.
You're
changing
what
name
is
.
That
probably
makes
this
false
:
Which
makes
this
statement
not
execute
:
I
suggest
taking
a
look
at
what
name
is
after
the
name.p.match(name)
.
group(1)
statement
.
Is
there
any
way
that
regular
expression
match
inside
a
if
block
would
interfere
with
the
code
inside
an
else
block
?
In
the
following
code
","
I
have
100
test
strings
that
are
being
inputed
as
job_name
that
should
be
appended
to
my
del_job_ids
array
.
Only
99
of
them
are
being
appended
.
If
I
comment
out
the
line
name=p.match(name).group(1
)
","
the
one
case
that
doesn't
get
appended
before
now
get
appended
.
I
can
also
append
that
job
by
uncommmenting
the
code
in
the
else
block
(
the
string
passes
the
conditon
for
getting
appended
)
.
The
difference
between
the
strings
is
that
99
of
them
have
colon
","
dashes
","
or
both
and
the
one
other
string
has
neither
.
I
tested
the
regex
multiple
times
.
The
string
without
dashes
or
colons
should
go
the
else
clause
and
use
the
'
default
'
name
defined
at
the
top
of
the
for
loop
.
This
part
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
.
If
'
jobs
'
is
an
iterable
","
then
the
first
time
through
the
loop
","
'
j
'
is
set
to
'
jobs
[0]
'
","
the
next
time
it's
set
to
'
jobs
[1]
'
","
etc.
So
using
'
j
'
to
index
into
'
jobs
'
is
crazy
talk
.
You're
saying
""""
give
me
the
next
element
from
the
iterable
'
jobs
'
","
then
use
that
element
as
an
index
into
'
jobs
'
.
You
can
accumulate
the
keys
in
the
order
of
appearance
and
can
build-up
the
key
frequencies
in
all
in
one
pass
.
Take
advantage
of
sort
stability
to
make
a
sort
by
decreasing
frequency
","
then
by
order
of
appearance
:
In
step
1
","
you're
iterating
over
a
query
object
.
This
results
in
one
fetch
RPC
per
20
objects
returned
","
which
is
inefficient
","
time-wise
.
Instead
","
call
fetch(n)
on
the
Query
object
","
where
n
is
the
maximum
number
of
results
to
return
-
this
does
only
a
single
RPC
.
It
also
has
the
benefit
of
limiting
the
number
of
results
to
search
-
right
now
","
if
I
search
for
'
I
'
","
your
app
will
get
stuck
processing
nearly
every
record
in
step
1
.
It's
also
completely
unnecessary
to
convert
the
keys
into
strings
-
you
can
add
keys
to
a
set
just
fine
.
For
what
it's
worth
","
though
","
I
personally
find
'
or
'
searches
to
be
particularly
useless
.
I
realise
you'll
rank
items
that
match
all
the
terms
first
","
but
those
will
inevitably
be
followed
by
piles
and
piles
of
irrelevant
results
.
You
could
do
an
'
and
'
search
simply
by
doing
one
query
with
an
equality
filter
for
each
search
term
.
In
lieu
of
full-text
search
on
GAE
I'm
using
the
solution
below
to
return
a
resultset
that's

the

It
feels
a

bulky

I'm
concerned
about

I'm
looking

a
different

The
secondary

important
to
my

since
a
given

likely
have

preserving

a
lot
of
complexity
right
now

Any
ideas
?
Step
1
:
Get
a

I
was
wondering
how
I
can
make
a
custom
QDialog
message
box
with
my
own
buttons
","
similar
to
the
code
below
.
So
far
I
have
this
code
","
which
works
pretty
well
.
The
problem
with
this
code
is
that
it
launches
from
a
full
screen
application
","
and
it
steals
the
focus
of
it
(
the
main
taskbar
on
the
top
appears
along
with
the
QDialog
object
)
.
I
want
this
to
work
seamlessly
with
my
fullscreen
application
in
the
background
","
meaning
no
taskbar
at
the
top
should
appear
when
I
click
on
a
button
to
show
this
message
box
.
I'm
working
in
Ubuntu
11.10
with
PyQt4
and
Python
2.7.2
.
I
think
the
issue
you're
having
is
that
you
aren't
giving
your
msgBox
a
parent
.
This
makes
Qt
treat
it
as
a
top-level
window
.
Try
changing
your
instantiation
of
your
message
box
to
look
like
this
:
This
isn't
simple
.
But
the
good
news
is
that
it's
very
well
understood

Assuming
all
the
scripts
are
python
the
easiest
solution
would
be
to
write
functions
that
imports(and thus runs)
the
other
scripts
.
point
to
these
functions
with
either
the
multiprocessing
or
threading
module
.
Now
that
you
have
each
script
running
in
its
own
process
or
thread
","
you
can
use
condition
objects
and
the
.
wait()
.
notify()
methods
to
have
them
stop
and
wait
on
each
other
.

documentation

implement
such
a

I
am
looking

a
mechanism

requirement
is
as
follows
Scripts
a

start

the
same
time

.
Once
a
","
b
","
or
c
hits
a
certain
point
in
the
script
","
it
should
stop
for
other
scripts
to
hit
the
same
point
.
For
the
sake
of
discussion
lets
call
these
as
syncpoints
.
Once
the
syncpoint
is
hit
","
by
all
scripts
","
all
scripts
can
proceed
to
next
syncpoint

end

use

I'm
using
networkx(library for python to deal with graphs)
.
I
basically
have
nodes
with
various
edges
but
want
to
see
what
a
path
would
look
like
if
it
used
the
nodes
that
were
the
most
connected
.
I
can
use
this
command
to
see
the
number
of
connections
:
and
I
can
get
the
number
of
edges
","
but
I'm
not
sure
how
to
apply
this
to
list
as
a
path
.
For
example
","
I
can
add
this
number
as
an
attribute
but
I
don't
think
attributes
are
taken
into
consideration
when
finding
a
path
and
because
I'm
adding
this
after
the
edges
are
connected
","
I
cannot
add
the
weights
to
the
edges
themselves
.
The
other
problem
is
the
higher
the
score
the
more
I
want
the
path
to
be
followed
but
with
edges
I
think
it
follows
the
lowest
weighted
edge
.
I'm
wondering
what
approach
do
other
people
take
to
find
paths
based
on
certain
characteristics
of
the
node
?
If
someone
knows
how
to
do
this
for
networkx
","
great
!
but
I
think
networkx
has
many
features
so
if
I
can
get
the
theory
or
general
approach
I'm
sure
I
can
find
a
way
to
do
it
in
python
.
UPDATE
:
Sorry
I
might
be
explaining
it
wrong
.
I
understand
I
can
add
attributes
to
nodes
","
but
I'm
not
sure
how
to
make
path
decisions
based
on
those
attributes
.
So
in
my
case
","
based
on
certain
conditions
I
am
adding
edges
between
nodes
.
Each
group
of
nodes
represents
a
different
"day(day1data.., day2data.., day3data..)"
","
so
I'm
connecting
a
few
nodes
from
day1
to
nodes
on
day2
only
if
certain
rules
are
matched
.
Once
I
have
the
edges
connected
","
I
want
those
ones
to
be
considered
more
heavily
when
choosing
a
path
.
So
I
added
an
attribute
'
weight
'
to
each
node
of
the
current
day
which
is
basically
the
total
number
of
edges
connecting
that
node
.
My
problem
is
","
the
weight
attribute
is
not
used
in
any
of
the
path
decision
making
because
its
an
attribute
I
created
and
labeled
myself(I could create a label named 'abc'='hello world' and it would apply that attribute to the node)
.
How
can
I
get
this
weight
to
be
considered
when
creating
the
path(the edges are already created so I don't think I can go back and recreate them)
?
From
the
NetworkX
Tutorial
It
looks
like
weights
can
be
added
after
the
fact
.
You
can
certainly
add
weights
to
edges
in
NetworkX
.
In
fact
","
you
can
set
arbitrary
data
for
edges
","
since
it
is
basically
a
dict
.
Furthermore
you
can
change
the
parameters
of
edges
(
or
nodes
)
after
you
added
them
.
And
you
can
of
course
calculate
path
according
to
weights
(
or
any
other
attribute
specified
in
the
weight
parameter
)
.
For
your
case
","
deciding
edge
weights
might
be
tricky
.
Bear
in
mind
that
weighted
shortest
path
is
calculated
usually
with
Djikstra's
Algorithm
and
it
favors
smaller
weights
.
It
also
requires
positive
weights
.
One
possible
solution
would
be
assigning
a
weight
of
1
/
"max(k_i,k_j)"
to
edge
(
i
","
j
)
where
k_i
","
k_j
is
the
degree
of
nodes
i
and
j
.
The
correct
way
to
compute
shortest
paths
over
transition
probabilities
is
to
transform
the
edge
weights
to
represent
surprisal
:
that
is
","
the
negative
log
of
the
probability
.
This
results
in
weights
that
are
positive
","
and
any
given
shortest
path
is
then
interpreted
as
minimizing
surprisal
.
And
since
Dijkstra's
algorithm
sums
up
weights
","
it
does
so
in
log
space
","
which
means
it
really
is
multiplying
probabilities
.
To
recover
the
joint
probability
of
observing
any
given
shortest
path
","
then
","
you
just
take
the
exponential
of
the
negative
surprisal
.

this

Hi

Is
there
a

refer

pages
that
are
unlinked
","
or
pages
which
have
a
low
update-rate
?
I
think
there
might
be
several
heuristics
which
could
be
used
to
prevent
wiki-rot
:
Number

Number

don't
know

everything
you
mentioned
certainly
sounds
do-able
in
one
way
or
another
.
You
can
use
the
trac-admin
CLI
command
to
get
a
list
of
wiki
pages
and
to
dump
the
contents
of
a
particular
wiki
page
(
as
plain
text
)
to
a
file
or
stdout
.
Using
this
","
you
can
write
a
script
that
reads
in
all
of
the
wiki
pages
","
parses
the
content
for
links
","
and
generates
a
graph
of
which
pages
link
to
what
.
This
should
pinpoint
""""
orphans
""""
(
pages
that
aren't
linked
to
)
","
pages
that
link
to
source
files
","
and
pages
that
link
to
external
resources
.
Running
external
links
through
something
like
wget
can
help
you
identify
broken
links
.
To
access
last-edited
dates
","
you'll
want
to
query
Trac's
database
.
The
query
you'll
need
will
depend
on
the
particular
database
type
that
you're
using
.
For
playing
with
the
database
in
a
(
relatively
)
safe
and
easy
manner
","
I
find
the
WikiTableMacro
and
TracSql
plugins
quite
useful
.
The
hardest
feature
in
your
question
to
implement
would
be
the
one
regarding
page
views
.
I
don't
think
that
Trac
keeps
track
of
page
views
","
you'll
probably
have
to
parse
your
web
server's
log
for
that
sort
of
information
.
My
main
goal
is
to
check
an
FTP
server
at
anytime
for
a
new
file
hits
and
then
generate
a
.
txt
file
with
only
the
new
files
copied
there
.
If
there
are
no
new
files
then
it
returns
nothing
.
Here
is
what
I
have
so
far
.
I
have
started
by
copying
the
files
from
the
server
into
oldlist.txt
","
then
connecting
to
the
FTP
site
and
comparing
data
from
newlist.txt
and
oldlist.txt
and
the
differences
I
want
in
Temporary
FTP
file
changes.txt
.
Each
time
I
connect
I
will
change
newlist.txt
and
make
it
the
oldlist.txt
so
that
I
can
compare
the
next
time
I
connect
.
Is
there
a
better
way
to
do
this
?
My
lists
seem
to
never
change
data
each
time
.
Sorry
if
this
is
confusing
thanks
.
Your
implementation
of
this
scheme
is
reasonable
.
I
would
not
choose
this
scheme
to
implement
automated
FTP
messaging
","
if
that
is
what
you're
doing
.
There
are
two
weaknesses
of
this
approach
:
It
does
not
support
filenames
that
repeat
.
Any
filename
that
occurs
in
the
""""
old
""""
history
will
not
be
detected
as
a
new
file
.
Maybe
this
is
a
problem
for
you
","
maybe
not
.
But
even
if
filenames
are
guaranteed
unique
now
","
that
may
not
always
be
true
.
It
does
not
tell
you
whether
a
new
file
is
ready
to
be
consumed
or
not
.
It
is
possible
that
a
new
file
will
be
processed
while
it
is
still
being
uploaded
.
Some
people
apply
a
""""
no
change
in
size
for
X
seconds
""""
rule
","
but
that
just
increases
delay
and
still
leaves
a
vulnerability
to
severed
connections
.
One
scheme
that
is
similar
but
does
not
have
either
of
these
two
problems
is
to
actually
store
a
file
on
the
server
with
a
reserved
name
","
or
in
a
separate
place
","
and
use
its
timestamp
(
preferably
the
modification
time
of
the
file
itself
)
to
decide
which
files
can
be
safely
processed
.
This
""""
semaphore
""""
file
is
updated
to
the
current
time
as
the
last
step
in
uploading
a
file
.
All
files
with
a
modification
time
older
than
the
semaphore
timestamp
can
be
processed
.
Once
processed
","
all
files
must
be
deleted
out
of
the
upload
folder
so
they
won't
be
processed
twice
.
I
have
seen
this
scheme
work
well
in
an
automated
production
data
flow
.
It's
a
little
easier
/
faster
to
convert
the
lists
to
a
set
and
not
worry
about
sorting
.
Also
","
instead
of
saving
the
list
to
a
file
as
raw
text
","
you
could
use
the
shelve
module
to
make
a
persistent
store
that
is
conveniently
accessible
like
a
regular
Python
dict
.
Otherwise
","
your
code
has
the
virtues
of
being
simple
and
straight-forward
.
Here's
a
worked
out
example
:
Congratulations
","
you've
discovered
the
motivating
use
case

Here's
how

both

call
another

the

of
the
overriding
method
in
an
inherited

would

the
following
code

print
out

You'll

If

Since

","
the
ignore
callable

be
called
once

i.e.
a

these

ignore_patterns()

be
used

a

on
glob-style

What's
the
best
way
to
convert
numpy's
recarray
to
a
normal
array
?
i
could
do
a
.
tolist()
first
and
then
do
an
array()
again
","
but
that
seems
somewhat
inefficient
.
.
Example
:
By
""""
normal
array
""""
I
take
it
you
mean
a
NumPy
array
of
homogeneous
dtype
.
Given
a
recarray
","
such
as
:
we
must
first
make
each
column
have
the
same
dtype
.
We
can
then
convert
it
to
a
""""
normal
array
""""
by
viewing
the
data
by
the
same
dtype
:
astype
returns
a
new
numpy
array
.
So
the
above
requires
additional
memory
in
an
amount
proportional
to
the
size
of
a
.
Each
row
of
a
requires
4+8+4=16
bytes
","
while
a.astype(...)
requires
8*3=24
bytes
.
Calling
view
requires
no
new
memory
","
since
view
just
changes
how
the
underlying
data
is
interpreted
.
a.tolist()
returns
a
new
Python
list
.
Each
Python
number
is
an
object
which
requires
more
bytes
than
its
equivalent
representation
in
a
numpy
array
.
So
a.tolist()
requires
more
memory
than
a.astype(...)
.
Calling
a.astype(...)
.
view(...)
is
also
faster
than
np.array(a.tolist()
)

Try
setting
the

odd

tried
it

the

blank

I
can't
reproduce
that
","
now
I
have
no
effect
from
that
one
line
change
.
What
I'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
what
to
do
to
the
QAction
so
that
the
toolbar
has
text
on
the
button
beside
the
image

or
can
it
be
done
at
all
like
this
?
Is
there
some
other
way
to
make
the

some

an

the

not

a
way

Example
:
There
isn't
a
direct
equivalent
to

p

Perl
(
the
automatic
input

","
but
that's
mostly
because
Python

use
the

Perl
does

For
your

It's

Python
doesn't

Perl
does
","
so
the

as

The
Python
equivalent
of
your

Perl
one-liner
is
approximately
:
You
have
a
problem
which
can
be
solved
several
ways
.
I
think
you
should
consider
using
regular
expression
(
what
perl
is
doing
in
your
example
)
directly
from
Python
.
Regular
expressions
are
in
the
re
module
.
An
example
would
be
:
(
I
would
prefer
using
$
instead
of
'
\
n
'
for
line
endings
","
because
line
endings
are
different
between
operational
systems
and
file
encodings
)
If
you
want
to
call
bash
commands
from
inside
Python
","
you
could
use
:
Where
command
is
the
bash
command
.
I
use
it
all
the
time
","
because
some
operations
are
better
to
perform
in
bash
than
in
Python
.
Finally
","
if
you
want
to
extract
the
numbers
with
grep
","
use
the
-
o
option
","
which
prints
only
the
matched
part
.
You
can
use
python
to
execute
code
directly
from
your
bash
command
line
","
by
using
python
-
c
","
or
you
can
process
input
piped
to
stdin
using
sys.stdin
","
see
here
.
Perl
(
or
sed
)
is
more
convenient
.
However
it
is
possible
","
if
ugly
:
I
need

pick
some
numbers
out

some
text
files
.
I
can
pick
out
the

need

grep
","
but
didn't
know
how
to
extract
the
numbers
from
the
lines
.
A
colleague
showed
me
how
to
do
this
from
bash
with
perl
:
However
","
I
usually
code
in
Python

So
my
question

I
have
used
Python

I.e

","
could

piped

Most

I'm
not

deal
with
at

10k

EDIT
:
The
operating
system
is
Linux

Facebook
needed
a
scalable
server
so
they
wrote
Tornado
(
which
uses
async

Twisted

also
famously
scalable

it

Gunicorn

An
easy
way

By
using

show
the

I'm
going
to
guess
you
do
something
like
:
The
problem
is
that
if
you
iterate

","
you
get
the
keys
not
the

What
you
want
is
:
Items

a
list
of
the
keys
and
values
as
tuples
and
you
can
iterate
over
that
.
The
for-loop
iterates
over
keys
which
you
can
then
use
to
lookup
the
corresponding
sequences
:
I
have
some
ancient
code
(
5
years
old
)
and
how
I
used
to
access
real_fft()
method
was
this
:
I
guess
the
FFT
module
came
with
NumPy
.
Now
","
years
later
I
installed
the

1.6.1
with

all
I
see

the
docs
"http://www.scipy.org/Numpy_Functions_by_Category,"
are
these
functions
:
fft()
fftfreq()
fftshift()
ifft()
It
is
strange
","
because
in
this
numpy
docs
","
real_fft()
is
there
:
http://numpy.sourceforge.net/numdoc/HTML/numdoc.htm#pgfId-304711
It
looks
like
NumPy
underwent
some
reorganisation
in
recent
years
.
http://www.scipy.org/Numpy_Example_List_With_Doc#fft
FFT
is
now
numpy.fft
","
and
real_fft()
seems
to
be
renamed
into
rfft()
I've
got
a
dozen
programs
that
can
accept
input
via
stdin

an
option
","
and
I'd
like
to
implement
the
same
features
in
a
similar
way
for
the
output
.
The
optparse
code
looks
like
this
:
The
rest
of
the
applicable
code
looks

this
:
This
code
works
fine

I
like
its
simplicity
-
but
I
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
reference
to
anyone
using
a
default
value
of
'
-
'
for
output
to
indicate
stdout
.
Is
this
a
good
consistent
solution

am
I
overlooking
something
better
or
more
expected
?
If
you
can
use
argparse
(
i.e.
Python
2.7
+
)
","
it
has
built-in
support
for
what
you
want
:
straight
from
argparse
doc
The
FileType
factory
creates
objects
that
can
be
passed
to
the
type
argument
of
ArgumentParser.add_argument()
.
Arguments
that
have
FileType
objects
as
their
type
will
open
command-line
arguments
[
…
]
FileType
objects
understand
the
pseudo-argument
'
-
'
and
automatically
convert
this
into
sys.stdin
for
readable
FileType
objects
and
sys.stdout
for
writable
FileType
objects
.
So
my
advice
is
to
simply
use
Then
you
can
do
To
read
from
file
and
output
to
output
","
or
to
read
""""
Ni
!
""""

output
to
output
","
or
…
And
it's
good
","
since
using
-
for
the
relevant
stream
is
a
convention
that
a
lot
of
programs
use
.
If
you
want
to
point
it
out

add
it

the
help
strings

For
reference
","
the
usage
message
will
be
For
input
files
you
could
use
fileinput

common
convention
for
input

:
if
no
files
given

'
it
reads
stdin

otherwise
it
reads

There
is
no
need
in
-
f
and
-
-
file
options
.
If
your
program
always
requires
an
input
file

it
is
not
an
option

EDIT
Hey
guys
Sorry
for
complicating
the
problem
too
much

i
forgot
to
mention
one
thing

wanted

""""
The
catcat

also
match
findall
+
len
seems
like
one
solution
.
If
you
wish
to
use
a
single
regular
expression
to
ensure
a
string
contains
exactly
2
instances
of
the
word
""""
cat
""""
","
(
no
more
","
no
less
","
and
not
""""
catastrophic
""""
or
""""
catcat
""""
)
","
then
the
following
tested
script
will
do
the
trick
:
However
","
if
you
do
wish
to
match
the
cat
in
""""
catastrophic
""""

""""
catcat

","
then
remove
all
the
\
b
word
boundary
anchors
from
the
regex
.
Don't
use
regular
expressions
just
because
they
are
there
.
As
Vincent
points
out
","
that
assumes
all
words
are
seperated
by
whitespace
.
Is
probably
a
better
options
.
Although
whether
that
is
neccesary
depends
on
details
not
provided
in
your
post
.
EDIT
If
you
don't
even
care
about
word
boundaries
","
there
is
even
less
reason
to
be
using
a
regular
expression
.
How
about
this
:
The
{
2
}
means
“
repeat
2
times
”
.
Use
{
7
}
for
7
repetitions
.
The
\
b
is
a
word
boundary
;
in
this
case
the
cat
in
""""
blue
cat
talks
""""
would
match
","
but
""""
verification
""""
wouldn't
.
And
the
.
*
will
match
any
string
.
You
might

go

You

rest

code
can
be
oblivious
to
which
module
is
actually
in
use
.
Instead
of
a

you
could
set

Attempt

what
I'm
doing

You
can
use
the

zero

This

","

Just
remove
the

A
couple
quick
notes
from
quickly
skimming
the
code
:
In
get_score()
you
could
add
an
else
clause
to
handle
any
ties
that
happen
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
check
for
it
explicitly
in
play_game()
Move
the
import random
to
the
top
of
the
file
.
imports
are
generally
always
found
at
the
top
of
the
file
.
Also
","
there's
no
need
to
re-import
every
time
you
want
a
random
number
.
Not
sure
if
this
is
a
typo
","
cause
play
seems
to
always
hold
an
integer
","
but
you
have
play
=
=
True
and
play
=
=
False
inside
play_game()
.
If
you
want
to
make
play
contain
either
True
or
False
","
you
need
to
be
using
a
single
equals
sign
","
eg
","
play
=
True
.
But
this
doesn't
seem
to
make
sense
because
you're
comparing
play
to
computer
as
if
they're
integers
.
Also
","
what
are
you
trying
to
accomplish
with
the
score
variable
in
the
get_score()
method
?
Ah
","
if
you
made
the
get_score()
method
return
something
so
you
know
who
won
the

it
would
be
helpful

You
can't

out

the
way

The
main
remaining
issues

you're

numbers
for
computer
choice
(
e.g

","
3

.
So
you
need
to
compare
them
as
such
.
In
other
words
","
instead
of
:
You
would
need
to
say
:
Second
:
you're
trying
to
reference
one
function's
variables
in
another
one
","
and
that
won't
work
.
If
you
want
your
computer_wins
","

variables
to
be
global
","
you
need
to
initialize
them
at
the
global
scope
","
e.g
.
right
after
your
""""
#
constants
""""

declared
and
before
you
get
into
main

Then
in
any
function

uses
them

you
must
say
e.g
.
global
computer_wins

indicate
they
are
global
and
not
local
.
Once
you
get
these
issues
addressed
","
it
should
work
a
bit
better

you'll
still
need

it

Your
original

calls

slice
and
it
will
return
[]
.
But
judging
from
your
code
you
don't
mean
to
change
image
in-place
","
you
rather
want
to
create
new_image
.
What
you
should
be
doing
is
inserting
slices
at
the
end
of
new_row
:
By
the
way
","
you
can
also
change
the
image
in-place
","
but
be
careful
.
As
you
are
passing
a
list
","
you
should
copy
it
before
changing
so
that
original
is
unchanged
.
Here
is
that
version
:
This
can
also
be
done
with
a
list
comprehension
in
single
line
","
but
it
will
be
less
readable
.
If
you
like
","
here
is
how
you
can
do
it
:
new_row.append(image[r][c])
should
be
outside
of
the
if
.
Also
","
you're
flipping
the
image
horizontally
...
twice
.
Make
your
for
loop
use
"range(0,cols/2,3)"
.
(
That
may
also
eliminate
the
need
for
that
if
.
)
You're
also
modifying
the
original
image
in-place
;
are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
that
?
Seems
a
simpler
solution
might
be
to
loop
through
each
row
in
reverse
","
appending
to
a
row
for
the
new
image
.
I'm
not
experienced
with
strings
","
but
the
version
I
have
(
2.21.51.20110605
)
has
an
8-bit
encoding
option
(
-
eS
)
that
would
work
with
utf-8
text
.
It
must
have
to
cast
a
wide
net
looking
for
'
text
'
delimited
by
non-printable
characters
(
value
<
32
)
.
I'd
expect
a
lot
of
noise
.
A
test
on
a
random
executable
showed
the
-
eS
(
8-bit
)
result
was
5
times
bigger
than
-
es
(
7-bit
)
.
I've
noticed
gnu-binutils-strings
can
printout
utf-16
content
in
a
file
-
is
it
possible
for
the
program
to
print
out
utf-8
strings
?
if
so
","
which
arguments
are
appropriate
?
i'm
working
in
a
python
environment
using
subprocess

would
like
to
work
with
the

a

I
often
find
myself
wanting
to
use
a
3rd
party
python
module
in
my
own
project
","
but
I
know
that
I
will
also
need
to
make
changes
to
the
3rd
party
module
that
I
want
to
push
upstream
.
What
is
the
best
practice
of
file
layout
/
installation
to
achieve
this
?
Most
python
modules
are
laid
out
with
root
dir
containing
a
""""
setup.py
""""
to
compile
/
install
the
module
.
The
problem
is
","
every
time
I
make
changes
to
the
module
source
I
need
to
re-run
the
full
install
step
in
order
to
use
those
changes
in
my
project
.
For
large
modules
","
like
scipy
this
can
take
some
time
.
Alternatively
","
I
can
hack
on
the
installed
version
of
the
python
module
","
but
then
I
have
to
manually
move
those
changes
back
to
the
source
version
of
the
module
in
order
to
generate
patches
etc.
I
know
about
virtualenv
and
PYTHONPATH
but
they
are
ways
of
installing
a
module
to
a
different
location
.
So
far
","
I
have
manually
created
symlinks
","
but
that
is
messy
.
If
the
3rd
party
project
is
using
setuptools
or
distribute
","
you
can
do
python
setup.py
develop
instead
of
install
.
This
will
create
the
appropriate
sym-links
in
the
site-packages
dir
for
you
.
Is
there
a
simple
method
to
pull
content

a
regex

Assume
I
have
the
following
sample
text
My
regex
is
:
This
will
obviously
return
the
entire
[
SOME
MORE
TEXT
]
"value=""ssss"
""""
","
however
I
only
want
ssss
to
be
returned
since
that's
what
I'm
looking
for
I
can
obviously
define
a
parser
function
but
I
feel
as
if
python
provides
some
simple
pythonic
way
to
do
such
a
task
Your
original
regex
is
too
greedy
:
r
'
.
*
\

'
won't
stop
at
the
first
'
]
'
and
the
second
'
.
*
'
won't
stop
at
'
""""
'
.
To
stop
at
c
you
could
use
[
^
c
]
or
'
.
*
?
'
:
Example
This
is
what
capturing
groups
are
designed
to
do
.
The
?
:

the
old
groups
(
the
parentheses
)
means
that
the
group
is
now
a
non-capturing
group
;
that
is
","
it
won't
be
accessible

a
group

the
result

I
converted
them
to
keep
the
output
simpler
","
but
you
can
leave
them
as
capturing
groups
if
you
prefer
(
but
then
you
have
to
use
matches.group(2)
instead
","
since
the
first

be
the

You
will
need
to
parse
the
settings

the
INI
file
yourself

Pylons
used

do
this
automatically

just
hard-coding
a
load
for

""""
.
The
two
options
you
have
are
1
)
just
load
the
INI
settings
via
settings
=
paste.deploy.appconfig('test.ini')

you
wanted
to
use
it

WebTest
app
=
pyramid.paster.get_app('test.ini')
which
would
parse
the
INI
file
and
return
an
actual
WSGI
app
.
Unfortunately
that
route
doesn't
give
you
access
to
the
INI
file
directly
","
it
automatically
just
passes
the
settings

your
app's
startup
function
"main(global_conf, **settings)"

You

I
want

check

a

Usually
wordpress

this
pattern

the

each

be

many
formats

Very
simple
solution
I
can
think
of
is
md5
digest
.
Open
an
URL

urllib

fetch
the
lines

convert

string

Create
a
md5
digest

the
values

store
it
in
a
file
.
Next
time
do
the
same
and
check
the
result
from
the

You
need
to
use
urllib

hashlib
modules
.
You
might
consider
web2py
.
The
framework
itself
is
very
easy
to
set
up
","
learn

use

it
provides
an
easy
way

The

would
simply
unzip
it

click
run

it

run
as
a
standalone

the
browser

the

It
even
includes
its
own
Python
interpreter

so
the
user
doesn't
have
to
have
Python
installed
(
very
helpful
on
Windows
","
which
does
not
typically
have

The
built-in
Rocket
server
will
be
more
than
adequate
for
running
locally

some

even
use

You
can

There
is
nothing
wrong
with
your
current
approach
.
time_diff
is
written
to
once
only
and
then
all
future
accesses

reads

It
effect
it
is
a
module
wide
constant

run

problems

global

have
multiple
threads

at

one

That's
not

You
can
wrap

you

wondering
if
there's
a

can't

standard

","

can't
find

(

)
while
your
test
should
work
with
quoted-printable
","
it
is
very
inefficient
for
binary
data
;
use
base64
instead
.
Update
:
Base64
encoding
produces
4
output
bytes
for
every
3
input
bytes
.
Your
base64
code
doesn't
work
with
56-byte
chunks
because
56
is
not
an
integral
multiple
of
3
;
each
chunk
is
padded
out
to
a
multiple
of
3
.
Then
you
join
the
chunks
and
attempt
to
decode
","
which
is
guaranteed
not
to
work
.
Your
chunking
loop
would
be
much
better
written
as
:
In
any
case
","
chunking
is
rather
slow
and
pointless
;
just
do
b2a_base64(raw_bytes)
I
want
to
convert
a
binary
file
(
such
as
a
jpg
","
mp3
","
etc
)
to
web-safe
text
and
then
back
into
binary
data
.
I've
researched
a
few
modules
and
I
think
I'm
really
close
but
I
keep
getting
data
corruption
.
After
looking
at
the
documentation
for
binascii
I
came
up
with
this
:
When
I
try
to
open
the
converted.jpg
I
get
data
corruption
:
-
/
I
also
tried
using
b2a_base64
with
57-long
blocks
of
binary
data
.
I
took
each
block
","
converted
to
a
string
","
concatenated
them
all
together
","
and
then
converted
back
in
a2b_base64
and
got
corruption
again
.
Can
anyone
help
?
I'm
not
super
knowledgeable
on
all
the
intricacies
of
bytes
and
file
formats
.
I'm
using
Python
on
Windows
if
that
makes
a
difference
with
the
\
r\n
stuff
@PMC's
answer
copied
from
the
question
:
Here's
what
works
:
Thanks
for
the
help
guys
.
I'm
not
sure
why
this
would
fail
with
[
0:56
]
instead
of
[
0:57
]
but
I'll
leave
that
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
:
P
Your
code
looks
quite
complicated
.
Try
this
:
Lines
tagged
with
#
1
and
#
2
represent
alternatives
to
each
other
.
#
1
seems
most
straightforward
to
me
-
just
make
it
one
string
","
process
it
and
convert
it
back
.
You
should
use
base64
encoding
instead
of
quoted
printable
.
Use
b2a_base64()
and
a2b_base64()
.
Quoted
printable
is
much
bigger
for
binary
data
like
pictures
.
In
this
encoding
each
binary
(
non
alphanumeric
character
)
code
is
changed
into
=
HEX
.
It
can
be
used
for
texts
that
consist
mainly
of
alphanumeric
like
email
subjects
.
Base64
is
much
better
for
mainly
binary
data
.
It
takes
6
bites
of
first
byte
","
then
last
2
bits
of
1st
byte
and
4
bites
from
2nd
byte
.
etc.
It
can
be
recognized
by
=
padding
at
the
end
of
the
encoded
text
(
sometimes
other
character
is
used
)
.
As
an
example
I
took
.
jpeg
of
271
700
bytes
.
In
qp
it
is
627
857
b
while
in
base64
it
is
362
269
bytes
.
Size
of
qp
is
dependent
of
data
type
:
text
which
is
letters
only
do
not
change
.
Size
of
base64
is
orig_size
*
8
/
6
.
Answering
my
own
question
here
","
but
if
anyone
knows
better
feel
free
to
answer
too
.
Some
of
it
seems
quite
fragile
(
eg
.
version
numbers
in
paths
)
","
so
comment
or
edit
if
you
know
a
better
way
.

.
Finding
the
files
Firstly
","
I
use
this
code
to
actually
find
the
root
of
the
GTK
runtime
.
This
is
very
specific
to
how
you
install
the
runtime
","
though
","
and
could
probably
be
improved
with
a
number
of
checks
for
common
locations
:
2
.
What
files
to
include
This
depends
on
(
a
)
how
much
of
a
concern
size
is
","
and
(
b
)
the
context
of
your
application's
deployment
.
By
that
I
mean
","
are
you
deploying
it
to
the
whole
wide
world
where
anyone
can
have
an
arbitrary
locale
setting
","
or
is
it
just
for
internal
corporate
use
where
you
don't
need
translated
stock
strings
?
If
you
want
Windows
theming
","
you'll
need
to
include
:
If
you
want
the
Tango
icons
:
There
is
also
localisation
data
(
which
I
omit
","
but
you
might
not
want
to
)
:
3
.
Piecing
it
together
Firstly
","
here's
a
function
that
walks
the
filesystem
tree
at
a
given
point
and
produces
output
suitable
for
the
data_files
option
.
So
now
you
can
call
setup()
like
so
:
I'm
using
Python
2.6
and
PyGTK
2.22.6
from
the
all-in-one
installer
on
Windows
XP
","
trying
to
build
a
single-file
executable
(
via
py2exe
)
for
my
app
.
My
problem
is
that
when
I
run
my
app
as
a
script
(
ie
.
not
built
into
an
.
exe
file
","
just
as
a
loose
collection
of
.
py
files
)
","
it
uses
the
native-looking
Windows
theme
","
but
when
I
run
the
built
exe
I
see
the
default
GTK
theme
.
I
know
that
this
problem
can
be
fixed
by
copying
a
bunch
of
files
into
the
dist
directory
created
by
py2exe
","
but
everything
I've
read
involves
manually
copying
the
data
","
whereas
I
want
this
to
be
an
automatic
part
of
the
build
process
.
Furthermore
","
everything
on
the
topic
(
including
the
FAQ
)
is
out
of
date
-
PyGTK
now
keeps
its
files
in
C:\Python2x\Lib\site-packages\gtk-2.0\runtime
\
...
","
and
just
copying
the
lib
and
etc
directories
doesn't
fix
the
problem
.
My
questions
are
:
I'd
like
to
be
able
to
programmatically
find
the
GTK
runtime
data
in
setup.py
rather
than
hard
coding
paths
.
How
do
I
do
this
?
What
are
the
minimal
resources
I
need
to
include
?
Update
:
I
may
have
almost
answered

For
the
""""
wimp

I
need
the

otherwise
with
the

sitting
directly
in
the
dist

But
where
does
the

come
from

that
gtk.gtk_version
is

Hey
guys
I've
got
a
problem
.
I'm
trying
to
send
variable

is
found
in
script
a
to

then
execute

Example
:

Script
b
Any
ideas
on
how
I
could
do
this
?
Thanks
Use
sys.argv
.
Which
gives
you
a
list
of
the
items
passed
on
the
command
line
Script
b
sys.argv
will
be
a
list
that
contains
[

'
]
in
this
case
.
I'm
parsing

ElementTree
I
wish
to
parse
all
the
'
xml
'
files
in
a
given
directory
.
The
user
should
enter
only
the
directory
name
and
I
should
be
able
to
loop
through
all
the
files
in
directory
and
parse
them
one
by
one
.
Can
someone
tell
me
the
approach
.
I'm
using
Linux
.
Just
create
a
loop
over
os.listdir()
:
Sort
b
based
on
items
'
index
in
a
","
with
all
items
not
in
a
at
the
end
.
If
you
want
to
make
list2
identical
to
list1
","
you
don't
need
to
mess
with
order
or
re-arrange
anything
","
just
replace
list2
with
a
copy
of
list1
:
list()
takes
any
iterable
and
produces
a
new
list
from
it
","
so
we
can
use
this
to
copy
list1
","
thus
creating
two
lists
that
are
exactly
the
same
.
It
might
also
be
possible
to
just
do
list2
=
list1
","
but
do
note
that
this
will
cause
any
changes
to
either
to
affect
the
other
(
as
they
point
to
the
same
object
)
","
so
this
is
probably
not
what
you
want
.
If
list2
is
referenced
elsewhere
","
and
thus
needs
to
remain
the
same
object
","
it's
possible
to
replace
every
value
in
the
list
using
list2
[
:
]
=
list1
.
In
general
","
you
probably
want
the
first
solution
.
or
may
be
just
check
everything
is
perfect
then..copy
list
a
for
b
The
easiest
way
to
do
this
would
be
to
use
zip
to
combine
the
elements
of
the
two
lists
into
tuples
:
sorted
will
compare
the
tuples
by
their
first
element
(
the
element
from
a
)
first
;
zip(*...)
will
""""
unzip
""""
the
sorted
list
.
I
have
two
lists
in
python
.
What
i
need
is
to
order
b
according
to
a
.
Is
there
any
methods
to
do
it
so
simply
without
any
loops
?
I'm
posting
this
without
further
comments

for
learning
purposes

im
trying

i
just
can't
wrap
my
head

whole
recursion
thing
so
im
wondering
if
i
could
get
some
pointers
here
","
i
looked
around
the
web
and
i
found
some
stuff
about
recursive
descent
parsing
but
the
tutorials
were
all
trying
to
do
something
more
complicated
than
i
needed
.
PS
:
i
realize
i
could
do
this
with
existing
python
libraries
but
what
would
i
learn
by
doing
that
eh
?
You
are
basically
reinventing
the
indexing
scheme
of
a
multidimensional
array
.
It
is
relatively
easy
to
code
","
but
you
can
use
the
two
functions
unravel_index
and
ravel_multi_index
to
your
advantage
here
.
If
your
grid
is
of
M
rows
and
N
columns
","
to
get
the
idx
and
idy
of
a
single
item
you
could
do
:
This
also
works
if
","
instead
of
a
single
index
","
you
provide
an
array
of
indices
:
So
if
cells
has
the
indices
of
several
cells
you
want
to
find
neighbors
to
:
You
can
get
their
neighbors
as
:
Or
","
if
you
prefer
it
like
that
:
The
nicest
thing
about
going
this
way
is
that
ravel_multi_index
has
a
mode
keyword
argument
you
can
use
to
handle
items
on
the
edges
of
your
lattice
","
see
the
docs
.
Let's
suppose
I
have
a
set
of
2D
coordinates
that
represent
the
centers
of
cells
of
a
2D
regular
mesh
.
I
would
like
to
find
","
for
each
cell
in
the
grid
","
the
two
closest
neighbors
in
each
direction
.
The
problem
is
quite
straightforward
if
one
assigns
to
each
cell
and
index
defined
as
follows
:
idx_cell
=
idx+N*idy
where
N
is
the
total
number
of
cells
in
the
grid
","
idx=x
/
dx
and
idy=y
/
dx
","
with
x
and
y
being
the
x-coordinate
and
the
y-coordinate
of
a
cell
and
dx
its
size
.
For
example
","
the
neighboring
cells
for
a
cell
with
idx_cell=5
are
the
cells
with
idx_cell
equal
to
4
","
6
(
for
the
x-axis
)
and
5+N
","
5-N
(
for
the
y-axis
)
.
The
problem
that
I
have
is
that
my
implementation
of
the
algorithm
is
quite
slow
for
large
(
N>1e6
)
data
sets
.
For
instance
","
to
get
the
neighbors
of
the
x-axis
I
do
[
x
[
(
idx_cell==idx_cell
[i]
-
1)|(idx_cell==idx_cell
[i]
+
1
)
]
for
i
in
cells
]
Do
you
think
there's
a
fastest
way
to
implement
this
algorithm
?
You'll
have
to
reference
the
XML
DOM
documentation
and
grit
your
teeth
.
To
get
the
first
<
server
>
element
","
then

A
neat
trick
for
those
using
IPython
in
windows
is
that
you
can
make
an
ipython
icon
in
each
of
your
project
directories
designed
to
open
with
the
notebook
pointing
at
that
chosen
project
.
This
helps
keep
things
separate
.
For
example
if
you
have
a
new
project
in
C:\fake\example\directory
Copy
an
ipython
notebook
icon
to
the
directory
or
create
a
new
link
to
the
windows
""""
cmd
""""
shell
.
Then
right
click
on
the
icon
and
""""
Edit
Properties
""""
Set
the
shortcut
properties
to
:
(
Note
the
added
slash
at
the
end
of
""""
start
in
""""
)
This
runs
windows
command
line
","
changes
to
your
working
directory
","
and
runs
the
ipython
notebook
pointed
at
that
directory
.
Drop
one
of
these
in
each
project
folder
and
you'll
have
ipython
notebook
groups
kept
nice
and
separate
while
still
just
a
doubleclick
away
.
UPDATE
:
IPython
has
removed
support
for
the
command
line
inlining
of
pylab
so
the
fix
for
that
with
this
trick
is
to
just
eliminate
""""
-
-
pylab
inline
""""
if
you
have
a
newer
IPython
version
(
or
just
don't
want
pylab
obviously
)
.
UPDATE
FOR
JUPYTER
NOTEBOOK
~
version
4.1.1
On
my
test
machines
and
as
reported
in
comments
below
","
the
newest
jupyter
build
appears
to
check
the
start
directory
and
launch
with
that
as
the
working
directory
.
This
means
that
the
working
directory
override
is
not
needed
.
Thus
your
shortcut
can
be
as
simple
as
:
If
jupyter
notebook
is
not
in
your
PATH
you
just
need
to
add
the
full
directory
reference
in
front
of
the
command
.
If
that
doesn't
work
please
try
working
from
the
earlier
version
.
Very
conveniently
","
now
""""
Start
in
:
""""

What
could
be
the
problem
?
This
could
be
due
to
network
congestion
in
your
LAN
.
If
it
is
just
happening
for
a
little
while
like
1
minute
.
I
try
to
understand
how
to
handle
1D
array
(
vector
in
linear
algebra
)
with
numpy
.
In
the
following
example
","
I
generate
two
numpy.array
a
and
b
:
For
me
","
a
and
b
have
the
same
shape
according
linear
algebra
definition
:
1
row
","
3
columns
","
but
not
for
numpy
.
Now
","
the
numpy
dot
product
:
I
have
three
different
output
.
What's
the
difference
between
"dot(a,a)"
and
"dot(b,a)"
?
Why
"dot(b,b)"
doesn't
work
?
I
also
have
some
differencies
with
those
dot
products
:
Notice
you
are
not
only
working
with
1D
arrays
:
So
","
b
is
a
2D
array
.
You
also
see
this
in
the
output
of
b.shape
:
(
1
","
3
)
indicates
two
dimensions
as
(
3
","
)
is
one
dimension
.
The
behaviour
of
np.dot
is
different
for
1D
and
2D
arrays
(
from
the
docs
)
:
For
2-D
arrays
it
is
equivalent
to
matrix
multiplication
","
and
for
1-D
arrays
to
inner
product
of
vectors
That
is
the
reason
you
get
different
results
","
because
you
are
mixing
1D
and
2D
arrays
.
Since
b
is
a
2D
array
","
"np.dot(b, b)"
tries
a
matrix
multiplication
on
two
1x3
matrices
","
which
fails
.
With
1D
arrays
","
np.dot
does
a
inner
product
of
the
vectors
:
With
2D
arrays
","
it
is
a
matrix
multiplication
(
so
1x3
x
3x1
=
1x1
","
or
3x1
x
1x3
=
3x3
)

been

eligible
to
be

Personally

I'd
store
an
rrule
object
from
python-dateutil
(
http://labix.org/python-dateutil
)
rather
than
inventing
your
own
recurrence
format

Then
you
can
just
define
some
methods
that
use
rrule

"between(after, before)"

generate
instances

One
catch

","
dateutil's
rrule
object
doesn't
pickle

you
should
define
your
own
mechanism
of
serialising
the
object
to
the
database

I've
generally
gone
with
a
JSON
representation
of
the
keyword
arguments
for
instantiating
the
rrule
.
The
annoying
edge
case
is
that
if
you
want
to
store
stuff
like

2nd
Monday

have
to
do
additional
work
with

because
the
value
it
returns

useful
.
It's
hard
to
explain
","
but
you'll
see
the
problem
when
you
try
it
.
I'm
not
aware
of
any
efficient
way
to
find
all
eligible
events
within
a
range

","
you'll
have
to
load
in
all
the
Event
models
that
potentially
overlap
with
the
range
.
So
you'll
always
be
loading
in
potentially
more
data
than
you'll
eventually
use
.
Just
make
sure
relatively
smart
about
it

reduce
the
burden

Providing

a

accelerated
SHA1
hasher
to
win
an
EngineYard
sponsored
hash
breaking
competition

I've
a
fully
functional
python
code

generates
some

uses

It

an
implementation

I

SHA1

adapt

many
ways

Don't

With

Here

You

So
change
your

Update

The
wizard
view
takes
form

You
are
creating

If
you

you

pass

Something
like
...
Use
the
enumerate()
function
to
generate
the
index
along
with
the
elements
of
the
sequence
you
are
looping
over

I
am
writing
a
simple
Python
for
loop
to
prnt
the
current
character
in
a
string
.
However
","
I
could
not
get
the
index
of
the

.
Here
is
what
I
have
","
does
anyone
know
a
good
way
to
get
the
current
index
of
the
character
in
the
loop
?
Do
you
want
to
iterate
over
characters
or
words
?
For
words
","
you'll
have
to
split
the
words
first
","
such
as
This
prints
the
index
of
the
word
.
For
the
absolute
character
position
you'd
need
something
like
You'd
read
the
lines
into
memory
","
into
a
list
and
then
index
into
that
list
:
I
have
a
list
which
contains
a
series
of
numbers
.
This
list
of
numbers
corresponds
to
a
line
in
a
.
dat
file
.
How
can
I
use
the
list
say
"[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,9,4]"
and
then
print
out
the
line
in
the
.
dat
file
which
each
number
corresponds
to
.
I
figured
out
how
to
make
it
work
.
From
this
:
To
this
:
I
am
working
on
inserting
a
local
image
into
a
table
on
my
mysql
server
.
I
can
insert
data
but
when
I
download
it
","
it
isn't
a
valid
jpg
.
Here
is
a
sample
like
what
I
am
using
.
Am
I
doing
something
wrong
when
I
format
the
data
?
The
code
completes
as
expected
but
the
jpg
is
no
good
.
I'm
playing
around
with
IPython
and
remote
control
:
There
is
a
behavior
difference
between
and
I
realy
can't
understand
what
append
?
Why
is
that
?
what
do
assignement
do
?
Assignment
itself
does
nothing
.
rc
here
is
your
client
.
Doing
rc
[0]
","
or
any
sort
of
indexing
","
generates
and
returns
a
DirectView
object
that's
a
view
with
whatever
engines
you
specify
in
[]
.
This
is
a
shorthand
for
generating
the
views
:
it's
not
actually
just
getting
a
specific
object
.
Thus
","
those
views
aren't
unique
.
The
best
way
to
explain
it
","
I
think
","
is
with
an
example
.
Say
you
have
2
engines
.
You
want
to
run
some
tasks
on
only
engine
one
","
and
want
the
tasks
to
block
.
You
want
to
run
others
on
only
engine
one
","
but
don't
want
them
to
block
.
You
want
to
run
yet
more
on
engines
1
and
2
","
and
don't
want
them
to
block
.
Then
you
could
do
:
Then
","
you
can
use
these
to
run
tasks
in
whatever
way
you'd
like
","
eg
There's
no
actual
magic
being
used
here
.
When
you
run
rc
[0]
twice
","
it
generates
two
views
.
The
second
view
is
not
the
same
as
the
first
.
When
you
assign
rc
[0]
to
a
variable
","
and
then
use
that
variable
","
you're
working
with
one
view
","
and
not
creating
a
new
one
.
iPython
","
like
Numpy
and
Scipy
","
has
quite
a
few
shorthand
notations
that
don't
necessarily
fit
Python's
idioms
perfectly
.
This
is
especially
the
case
with
[]
and
getitem
.
A
purer
Python
way
of
writing
this
could
would
be
to
use
the
much
more
unwieldy
rc.direct_view(1)
","
and
so
on
","
which
would
make
clear
that
this
wasn't
just
getting
an
item
","
and
was
actually
creating
a
view
.
It
is
in
most
of
the
situations
easy
to
implement
copy
constructors
(
or
overloaded
assignment
operator
)
in
C
+
+
since
there
is
a
concept
of
pointers
.
However
","
I'm
quite
confused
about
how
to
implement
shallow
and
deep
copy
in
Python
.
I
know
that
there
are
special
commands
in
one
of
the
libraries
but
they
don't
work
on
classes
that
you
have
written
by
yourself
.
So
what
are
the
common
ways
to
implement
?
P.S
.
Showing
process
on
some
basic
data
structures
(
linked
list
or
tree
)
will
be
appreciated
.
EDIT
:
Thanks
","
they
worked
","
it
was
my
mistake
in
syntax
.
I
am
very
interested
in
overwriting
these
functions
with
__copy__()
and
__deep_copy()
__
.
For
example
.
how
can
I
make
a
deep
copy
without
knowing
which
type
of
information
is
in
a
data
structure
?
The
python
copy
module
can
reuse
the
pickle
module
interface
for
letting
classes
customize
copy
behaviour
.
The
default
for
instances
of
custom
classes
is
to
create
a
new
","
empty
class
","
swap
out
the
__class__
attribute
","
then
for
shallow
copies
","
just
update
the
__dict__
on
the
copy
with
the
values
from
the
original
.
A
deep
copy
recurses
over
the
__dict__
instead
.
Otherwise
","
you
specify
a
__getstate__()
method
to
return
internal
state
.
This
can
be
any
structure
that
your
class
__setstate__()
can
accept
again
.
You
can
also
specify
the
__copy__()
and
/
or
__deepcopy__()
methods
to
control
just
copy
behaviour
.
These
methods
are
expected
to
do
all
the
copying
themselves
","
the
__deepcopy__()
method
is
passed
a
memo
mapping
to
pass
on
to
recursive
deepcopy()
calls
.
An
example
could
be
:
This
example
defines
custom
copy
hooks
to
prevent
self.spam
being
copied
too
","
as
a
new
instance
will
calculate
it
anew
.
I
am
new
to
Python
and
am
trying
to
grasp
existing
scripts
.

example

""""
As
best
I
can
tell
the
steps
are
:
the
function
starts
looping
through
the

a
variable
""""

declared
that

it

)
a
variable
""""

is
declared
that

useful

x

list
(
again
","
what
does
this

)
I
think
my
core
confusion
is
regarding
those
two
lines
with
BBox
","
and
how
they
interact
to
create
a
11x17

Thank
you
for
anyone
who
can
clear
this
up

typically
shorthand
for
""""

:
in
this
case
","
the

defining
the
dimensions
of
your

In
this
case
","
it
looks
like
it
is
an
array
of
4
numbers
","
the
first
two

are
the
top-left
corner

the
third
is
the
x-coordingate

the
page

","
because
the
left

also
the
width
)
","
and
the
fourth
is
the
bottom
/
height
of
the
page
.
I
wrote
this
simple
function
""""
processing_flush
""""
in
order
to
print
a
sequence
of
points
(
given
by
index

to
test
if
my
software
is
processing
my
data
and
eventually
the
speed
.
The
total
size
of
my
data
is
unknown
.
The
problem
that
i
cannot
fix
is
when
all

printed
the
first
time
(
ex
:

if

)
the
cursor
doesn't
start
from
zero
.
Before
you
overwrite
the
same
line
again
you
need
to
clear
at
least
the
positions
where
the
dots
are
with
spaces
.
The
code
above
may
lead
to
some
brief
flicker
.
In
your
specific
case
it
is
sufficient
to
clear
the
line
when
n
%
index
becomes
0
:
Or
even
better
always
write
index-1
characters
:
Edit
1
:
Or
if
you
prefer
to
have
the
cursor
always
after
the
last
dot
:
Edit
2
:
Or
if
you
prefer
to
have
the
cursor
always
at
the
beginning
of
the
line
:
The
reason
is
that
your
shell
remembers
the
remaining
characters
of
the
previous
line
if
you
overwrite
just
the
first
part
of
it
.
This
might
be
more
easily
accomplished
using
the
Google
Maps
API
and
JavaScript
on
the
client
side

Your

JavaScript

the
way
to

following
dict
:
Your
sql
query
could
be
constructed
as
following
:
Now
you
have
to
construct
the
fields
string
and
for
the
values
you
do
something
similar
","
using
the
already
created
fields
lists
.
(
This
could
be
done
in
another
way
if
your
dictionary
was
an
OrderedDict
)
.
Finally
you
can
compose
the
string
.
This
is
a
very
rough
method
","
but
very
understandable
if
you
are
new
to
this
topic
.
Most
of
frameworks
allow
for
much
refined
methods
to
achieve
this
.
Especially
as
to
SQL
injections
.
Print
it
","
play
around
","
understand
the
concepts
and
with
time
you'll
probably
use
other
ways
.
EDIT
A
more
succinct
way
would
be
:
You
can
concatenate
the
keys
and
the
values
of
the
dictionary
with
join()
and
map()
:
I'm
not
so
familiar
with
SQL
.
I
have
a
table
with
over
100
columns
.
What
is
the
best
way
to
insert
data
from
a
dictionary
into
the
corresponding
column
of
my
table
(
key
and
column
names
are
identical
)
?
Example
:
My
SQL
Table
Column1
Column2
Column3
Column4
Column5
My
data
which
I
get
from
a
dictionary
:
First
Data
set
Column2:apple
","
Column4:tree
Second
Data
set
Column1:banana
","
Column2:blue
","
Column3:green
","
Column4:house
","
Column5:red
So
if
the
key
of
the
dictionary
is
identical
to
the
column
name
of
the
table
","
the
data
should
be
inserted
.
I
know
how
to
do
this
for
a
single
query
but
how
can
I
do
this
(
clever
)
for
a
large
number
of
queries
?
Thanks
!
Edit
:
What
I
would
do
at
a
single
level
and
some
clarifications
:
1
)
Create
a
SQL
Table
with
all
120
columns
but
without
any
data
.
2
)
I
have
about
500
word
files
which
contain
a
part
of
the
data
which
should
go
into
the
database
(
about
5-10
from
the
120
columns
)
.
3
)
So
I
have
to
read
them
","
parse
them
and
if
the
key
of
the
data
in
the
dictionary
match
any
of
the
120
column
names
","
the
value
should
be
inserted
.
3
)
Single
mode
:
sql
=
INSERT
INTO
Column1
valuexy
This
is
of
course
very
stupid
for
500
files
and
120
columns
.
I
hope
this
was
more
clear
.
How
do
I
change
the
mode
stdin
is
opened
in
?
Specifically
","
we're
piping
CSV
files
to
the
python
script
to
clean
up
the
data
","
but
with
vertical
tabs
in
the
data
it
seems
to
need
to
be
in
universal-newlines
mode
.
The
problem
data
seems
to
be
some
\
x0b
characters
in
the
input
stream
.
As
printed
by
python
","
after
opening
one
of
the
files
with
'
rU
'
According
to
PEP
278
universal-newlines
is
on
by
default
.
Universal
newline
support
is
enabled
by
default
","
but
can
be
disabled
during
the
configure
of
Python
.
Do
you
have
any
sample
data
?
Your
problem
is
that
the
CSV
file
you
are
reading
uses
CR
(
\
r
)
newlines
exclusively
;
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
vertical
tabs
.
Python
2.x
opens
stdin
without
universal
line
support
(
so
that
binary
files
work
correctly
)
.
As
a
workaround
","
you
can
try
this
","
assuming
your
input
is
relatively
small
:
Please
help
.
Besides
","
there
is
one
more
way
to
get
the
average
of
list
is
","
you
can
use
this
one
also
.
Parse
the
IP
into
an
int
","
and
use
bitwise
operators
to
get
it
.
Another
way
would
be
to
use
a
library
like
ipaddr-py
.
I'd
personally
prefer
the
library
.
Use
Regex
:
Using
a
regular
expression
would
be
simple
in
this
situation
.
Using
the
re.match
method
in
conjunction
would
yield
your
result
.
Regular
expressions
can
be
cumbersome
.
You
can
also
use
the
split()
function
I
would
use
regular
expressions
.
You
can
split
all
the
octets
into
a
list
using
r
'
.
'
and
then
recombine
them
in
whatever
order
you
like
.
You
could
write
a
more
complicated
re
to
do
it
in
one
stroke
","
but
i
think
that'd
be
a
bit
harder
.
I
am
writing
a
Python
script
that
will
take
an
IP
address
in
CIDR
format
(
ie
.
1.1.1.0
/
32
or
10.0.0.1
/
24
)
and
split
the
IP
into
three
parts
:
the
first
three
octets
(
1.1.1
)
","
the
last
octet
(
0
)
and
the
Subnet
mask
(
32
)
.
The
IP
will
be
of
variable
length
so
I
don't
know
if
I
can
use
some
sort
of
string
character
counter

Any
ideas

There
is
no
moveToThread()
for
processes
since
a
process
lives
in
its
own
memory
space
","

see
MainWindow

any

it

The
application

you
start
using
QProcess
should
be
able
to
execute
as
stand-alone
application
.
To
run
spectra
in
another
QProcess
","
you
will
need
to
make
spectra
a
separate
executable
module
instead
of
MainWindow
member
as
it
is
now
.
EDIT
:
You
need
to
define
the
self-contained
module
that
is
least
dependent
on
the
MainWindow
-
it
can
be
spectra

You

to
minimize
communication

dependency

You
may
think
of
a
process

simple
C
program

int
"main(int argc,char* argv[])"

you
can
pass

change
this

a
QProcess

I
can
take
advantage
of
multicore
processing

Is
there
a
simple
way

do
this

simply
change

I
can't
get
anything

work
very
well

I
figured
it
would
be
easier
to
use
QProcess

Here
is
the
simplified
code
I
have
for
QThreads
","
signals

slots

I
suggest
you
do
your
loops
to
match
the
indices

the
result
in
the
result
array
rather
than
the
parameters
in
your
computational
function

I
have
a
question
.
I
am
currently
moving
over
from
matlab

python

whilst
I
found
it
easy
to
adapt
to
numpy
and
scipy
some
parts
are
still
a
bit
enigmatic
;
)
What
I
want
to
do
is
calculate
data
in
two
nested
loops
and
put
(
reshape
)
it
into
an
(
m
","
n
)
array
to
make
a
contour
plot
.
So
I
thought
about
the
following
:
but
now
I
am
not
entirely
sure
how
I
should
put
this
into
the
right
shape
(
in
Matlab
I
would
just
index
the
loops
with
i=1:1:10
and
so
on
and
pull
the
actual
value
of
i
out
of
a
vector
...
)
.
I
could
append
the
results
res.append(res)
and
reshape
it
with
"res.reshape((m,n)"
)
.
But
there
might
be
a
more
elegant
way
of
doing
so
?
Every
help
is
very
welcome

This
is

doesn't

Hi
i
am
using
a
variable
`
in
my
template
file
which
gives
me
a
current
month
value
in
english
{
{
currentMonth
}
}
how
can
i
convert
this
into
spanish
language
I
think
you're
misunderstanding
the
way
celery
works
.
You
can't
just
replace
its
broker
with
a
MySQL
table
of
your
own
design
-
well
","
not
without
making
substantial
changes
to
its
source
code
.
The
broker
is
an
internal
part
of
celery
which
it
uses
to
keep
track
of
its
tasks
","
using
its
own
internal
format
","
so
there's
no
inherent
advantage
to
using
a
MySQL
broker
solely
because
that's
the
way
in
which
you
currently
store
the
information
necessary
to
perform
your
tasks
.
You
can
still
use
celery
if
you
like
","
but
you'd
have
to
write
the
code
necessary
to
translate
your
user
activity
table
into
celery
tasks
.
However
","
I'd
recommend
experimenting
with
celery
first
to
...
get
a
basic
understanding
of
how
to
use
it
determine
if
it's
a
good
solution
for
what
you're
trying
to
achieve
Start
off
with
the
celery
tutorial
","
and
see
how
it
goes
from
there
.
Task
at
hand
:
There
is
a
MySQL
table
","
where
a
user
activity
is
pushed
as
a
row
.
That
activity
needs
to
be
processed
later
.
Processing
without
Celery
:
Use
a
script
which
picks
up
N
records
to
process
","
processes
them
and
then
updates
the
status
as
PROCESSED
for
processed
records
.
How
can
the
same
be
achieved
using
Celery
","
I
would
like
to
use
the
same
functionality
to
mark
tasks
instead
of
using
a
broker
?
i.e.
task
add
->
take
10
oldest
rows
added
to
the
mysql
table
with
status
UNPROCESSED
","
which
has
the
task
related
data
as
well
.
on
task
finish
->
mark
the
rows
as
PROCESSED
.
How
can
celery
be
told
that
instead
of
pushing
the
task
onto
the
broker
","
it
has
to
retrieve
tasks
from
the
MySQL
table
?
I
am
a
beginner
at
Celery
","
hence
not
aware
of
all
its
functionalities
.
Using
MySQL
as
broker
is
not
recommended
","
but
I
would
like
to
know
the
feasibility
.
I'm
currently
using
the
staticfiles_urlpatterns
to
serve
static
files
in
development
","
as
recommended
","
but
I'm
getting
404's
on
the
static
files
for
a
particular
app
I'm
using
and
not
sure
why
...
turning
on
directory
indexes
for
all
the
static
files
would
be
cool
if
its
possible
.
I
noticed
the
'
show_indexes
'
option
for
serving
some
types
of
static
files
.
Is
it
possible
to
write
my
debug-only
url
conf
in
a
way
that
enables
this
across
the
board
for
my
static
files
in
development
?
Something
like
this
should
work
(
update
to
use
STATIC_ROOT
)
:
In
the
following
code
","
everything
defaults
over
to
the
Member's
index
controller
.
How
can
I
setup
add_view
to
point
to
particular
methods
within
Members
?
This
way
I
can
have
a
single
Members
button
with
functionality
related
to
it
in
the
dropdown
.
views
:
admin
module
:
Not
sure
how
it'll
help
","
as
you're
creating
3
instances
of
same
class
.
While
you
can
keep
implementation
highly
coupled
","
it
won't
be
as
different
as
having
3
different
classes
.
Anyway
","
add_view
will
always
point
menu
item
to
index
method
.
However
","
self._default_view
contains
default
view
method
name
(
index
for
your
Members
class
)
.
Just
to
give
an
idea
how
it
can
look
like
:
%
d
stands
for
""""
decimal
""""
.
!
is
there
with
the
rest
of
the
string
.
%
d
means
that
a
decimal
number
will
be
outputted
there
.
Synonim
for
%
d
is
also
%
i
.
same
goes
for
instance
with
%
s
and
strings
It
is
used
for
string
formatting
.
The
random
number
will
be
converted
to
an
integer
(
since
%
d
is
being
used
)
","
then
it
will
be
converted
to
a
string
and
inserted
into
the
given
string
.
For
example
:
There
are
several
other
letters
that
correspond
to
different
types
.
They
can
be
found
here
(
in
the
second
table
of
that
section
)
.
These
are
format
specifiers
.
The
%
d
specifier
refers
specifically
to
a
decimal
(
base
10
)
integer
.
The
%
s
specifier
refers
to
a
Python
string
.
I
was
looking
at
this
python
tutorial
and
in
the
generator
section
they
had
something
like
this
:
What
I
want
to
know
is
exactly
what
does
that
mean
and
is
there
any
other
letters
because
I've
seen
%
s
before
.
I've
googled
everything
I
could
think
of
and
nothing
gave
me
an
answer
.
I'm
writing
a
Python
script
that
needs
to
tail
-
f
a
logfile
.
The
operating
system
is
RHEL
","
running
Linux
2.6.18
.
The
normal
approach
I
believe
is
to
use
an
infinite
loop
with
sleep
","
to
continually
poll
the
file
.
However
","
since
we're
on
Linux
","
I'm
thinking
I
can
also
use
something
like
pyinotify
(
https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify
)
or
Watchdog
(
https://github.com/gorakhargosh/watchdog
)
instead
?
What
are
the
pros
/
cons
of
the
this
?
I've
heard
that
using
sleep()
","
you
can
miss
events
","
if
the
file
is
growing
quickly
-
is
that
possible
?
I
thought
GNU
tail
uses
sleep
as
well
anyhow
?
Cheers

Victor
The
cleanest
solution
would
be
inotify
in
many
ways
-
this
is
more
or
less
exactly
what
it's
intended
for
","
after
all
.
If
the
log
file
was
changing
extremely
rapidly
then
you
could
potentially
risk
being
woken
up
almost
constantly
","
which
wouldn't
necessarily
be
particularly
efficient
-
however
","
you
could
always
mitigate
this
by
adding
a
short
delay
of
your
own
after
the
inotify
filehandle
returns
an
event
.
In
practice
I
doubt
this
would
be
an
issue
on
most
systems
","
but
I
thought
it
worth
mentioning
in
case
your
system
is
very
tight
on
CPU
resources
.
I
can't
see
how
the
sleep()
approach
would
miss
file
updates
except
in
cases
where
the
file
is
truncated
or
rotated
(
i.e.
renamed
and
another
file
of
the
same
name
created
)
.
These
are
tricky
cases
to
handle
however
you
do
things
","
and
you
can
use
tricks
like
periodically
re-opening
the
file
by
name
to
check
for
rotation
.
Read
the
tail
man
page
because
it
handles
many
such
cases
","
and
they're
going
to
be
quite
common
for
log
files
in
particular
(
log
rotation
being
widely
considered
to
be
good
practice
)
.
The
downside
of
sleep()
is
of
course
that
you'd
end
up
batching
up
your
reads
with
delays
in
between
","
and
also
that
you
have
the
overhead
of
constantly
waking
up
and
polling
the
file
even
when
it's
not
changing
.
If
you
did
this
","
say
","
once
per
second
","
however
","
the
overhead
probably
isn't
noticeable
on
most
systems
.
I'd
say
inotify
is
the
best
choice
unless
you
want
to
remain
compatible
","
in
which
case
the
simple
fallback
using
sleep()
is
still
quite
reasonable
.
EDIT
:
I
just
realised
I
forgot
to
mention
-
an
easy
way
to
check
for
a
file
being
renamed
is
to
perform
an
os.fstat(fd.fileno()
)
on
your
open
filehandle
and
a
os.stat()
on
the
filename
you
opened
and
compare
the
results
.
If
the
os.stat()
fails
then
the
error
will
tell
you
if
the
file's
been
deleted
","
and
if
not
then
comparing
the
st_ino
(
the
inode
number
)
fields
will
tell
you
if
the
file's
been
deleted
and
then
replaced
with
a
new
one
of
the
same
name
.
Detecting
truncation
is
harder
-
effectively
your
read
pointer
remains
at
the
same
offset
in
the
file
and
reading
will
return
nothing
until
the
file
content
size
gets
back
to
where
you
were
-
then
the
file
will
read
from
that
point
as
normal
.
If
you
call
os.stat()
frequently
you
could
check
for
the
file
size
going
backwards
-
alternatively
you
could
use
fd.tell()
to
record
your
current
position
in
the
file
and
then
perform
an
explicit
seek
to
the
end
of
the
file
and
call
fd.tell()
again
.
If
the
value
is
lower
","
then
the
file's
been
truncated
under
you
.
This
is
a
safe
operation
as
long
as
you
keep
the
original
file
position
around
because
you
can
always
seek
back
to
it
after
the
check
.
Alternatively
if
you're
using
inotify
anyway
","
you
could
just
watch
the
parent
directory
for
changes
.
Note
that
files
can
be
truncated
to
non-zero
sizes
","
but
I
doubt
that's
likely
to
happen
to
a
log
file
-
the
common
cases
will
be
being
deleted
and
replaced
","
or
truncated
to
zero
.
Also
","
I
don't
know
how
you'd
detect
the
case
that
the
file
was
truncated
and
then
immediately
filled
back
up
to
beyond
your
current
position
","
except
by
remembering
the
most
recent
N
characters
and
comparing
them
","
but
that's
a
pretty
grotty
thing
to
do
.
I
think
inotify
will
just
tell
you
the
file
has
been
modified
in
that
case
.
What
makes
you
think
your
only
have
one
connection
to
redis
?
Actually
my
little
test
shows
that
your
server
is
indeed
opening
lots
of
connections
to
redis
.
To
make
the
test
more
clear
","
I
modified
your
print
statement
a
bit
:
Then
run
this
script
to
make
some
requests
:
And
here's
what
I
got
:
It
can
be
seen
that
at
peek
time
you
have
10
greenlets
running
simultaneously
","
waiting
for
sockets
.
Your
code
looks
perfectly
fine
to
me
.
Why
'
the
performance
is
bad
'
is
another
story
.
It
could
be
your
sorted
set
of
'
online
'
is
tooo
large
.
Or
more
likely
you
are
using
a
blocking
client
to
test
the
server
","
in
which
case
you'll
see
only
one
connection
to
redis
.
Have
a
look
at
http://gehrcke.de/2013/01/highly-concurrent-connections-to-redis-with-gevent-and-redis-py/
I'm
not
100
%
is
your
monkey-patching
is
doing
the
trick
but
I'd
replace
it
with
:
You
could
also
go
and
create
your
own
pool
with
gevent
supported
connection
to
redis
...
I'm
using
gevent
to
build
a
server
which
do
some
redis
stuff
and
return
the
result
to
client
.
But
the
performance
is
bad
.
After
some
research
I
found
that
there
is
only
one
connection
to
redis
.
It
looks
like
there
is
only
one
greenlet
spawned
.
Here
is
my
program
:
Is
there
something
wrong
with
my
program
?
Why
there
is
only
one
connection
to
redis
?
For
the
template
part
everything
looks
absolutely
ok
and
there
should
not
be
problem
if
what
you
do
is
what
you
showed
.
Is
Your
list
is
dict()
or
actually
list()
?
Because
your
problem
is
here
:
This
syntax
will
work
only
if
List
is
dictionary
.
In
case
of
list
you
should
write
:
Here
is
what
i
want
tmpl1.jinja
tmpl2.jinja
tmpl3.jinja
Basically
i
have
a
user
block
that
exists
across
site
with
only
the
action(one or more link but with quiet a few html like image etc)
changing
.
What
can
i
do
.

any

other

you

The

I

it

I
have

Understanding
how
a
radiobutton
in
a
Tkinter
menu
works
code
I
have
a
radio
button
inside
the
options
menu
as
so
:
v
=
BooleanVar()
v.set(True)
"options.add_radiobutton(label=""change pop up"", command =togglePopUp,variable=v,onvalue=True,offvalue=False)"
togglePopUp
is
a
function
that
changes
the
value
of
variable
v
from
True
to
False
or
vice
versa
.
Main
window
is
already
opened
and
this
menu
will
be
added
later
to
the
window
.
This
is
just
the
fragment
of
code
that
is
related
to
the
radiobutton
.
Question
Now
my
question
is
when
I
press
the
radiobutton
(
after
running
the
code
)
will
the
value
of
the
variable
be
changed
or
will
the
function
togglePopUp
be
called
?
If
the
function
will
be
called
then
what
will
happen
to
the
status
of
the
radiobutton
?
will
the
status
of
the
radiobutton
be
updated
instantly
or
will
there
be
a
delay
?
research
I
read
about
the
radiobutton
and
the
Boolean
variable
from
the
Tkinter
book
at
effbot.org
.
But
I
was
not
convinced
about
how
it
worked
.
I
tried
a
program
but
I
am
not
getting
the
output
that
I
essentially
want
.
So
I
decided
to
understand
how
it
works
at
a
deeper
level
.

the

change
its

","
and
after
that
the
event
handler
passed
as
command
option
is
called
if
present
.
Also
your
example
would
not
work
","
since
add_radiobutton
doesn't
allow
the
onvalue

offvalue
options
-
only

.
For
a

","
s
","
doing

only
remove

you

the

you
tried
the
replace

my
output

Now
I
want
to
get
rid

Python
.
How
can
I
realize
this

Should
I
use
re

?
I
use
text
to
represent
all
the

"text.strip(""\n"")"

You

there

","
so
somewhere
down
the
line
we'll
need
to
pick
one

One
way
to
do
this
which
seems
kind
of
nice
could
be
to
use
where
(
and
then
max
)
:
Note
:
if
there
is
no
row
with
name

this

return
NaN

Is
this
the
only
way

thanks
.
There's
one
method
that
no
one
mentioned
that
might
be
worth
noting
.
This
was
a
problem
I
was
having
where
I
was
doing
multiple
criteria
checks
and
getting
back
a
single
item
Series
(
basically
a
unique
row
result
)
.
If
you
have
a
single
item
in
a
Series
and
just
need
that
item
OR
know
the
index
of
the
particular
item
you
want
to
gather
","
just
do
this
:
for
the
first
(
and
only
)
item
in
a
single
item
Series
.
Or
this
:
where
index
is
the
index
of
the
item
you
are
looking
for
in
the
Series
.
If
you
want
it
as
a
string
","
you
may
have
to
cast
as
a
string
if
it
is
not
already
stringified
by
default
.
This
what
I
asked
to
do
:
"save_friends(filename, friends_list)"
takes
a
file
name
and
a
friends
list
and
writes
that
list
to
thefile
in
the
correct
format
.
So
","
for
example
","
"save_friends('friends.csv', load_friends('friends.csv')"
)
should
overwrite
the
friends
le
with
exactly
the
same
content
.
This
is
my
code
:
The
problem
is
when
I
run
the
text
code(a code provided by school that dose some simple tests)
","
it
tells
me
So
","
how
can
I
return
'
None
'
while
the
input
is
not
really
a
list(Like the input 'd' in this circumstance)
?
You
replace
the
friends_list
argument
with
an
empty
list
at
the
top
of
your
function
:
Remove
that
line
.
Also
","
your
function
should
not
return
anything
;
you
need
to
remove
the
return
line
too
to
pass
the
assignment
test
","
which
expected
None
from
the
function
(
which
is
the
default
)
.
Note
that
by
returning
early
","
you
never
call
.
close()
on
the
file
either
.
I
have
a
total
of
10
files
(
could
be
more
at
some
point
-
but
it
will
be
a
fixed
number
)
.
They're
small
-
at
around
80
byte
.
While
reading
from
them
is
all
good
and
works
-
its
slow
.
I
guess
its
because
the
script
handles
them
one
by
one
and
waits
for
the
IO
-
so
I
started
to
read
into
Threading
and
Queue
but
I
couldnt
come
up
with
a
working
solution
...
Can
anyone
give
me
an
example
of
opening
several
files
threaded
?
Code
I'd
like
to
put
into
several
threads
:
Reading
small
files
isn't
slow
","
provided
you
do
it
in
one
go
.
First
","
let's
create
a
80
byte
test
file
;
Then
we
define
a
function
to
read
all
of
it
;
Then
","
a
timing
run
(
reading
from
a
normal
harddisk
","
not
an
SSD
)
:
So
it
takes
18
μs
to
read
such
a
file
.
I
wouldn't
call
that
slow
.
When
I
create
9
of
these
test
files
and
read
them
in
a
loop
:
With
the
loop
overhead
it
is
still
only
about
21
μs
per
file
.
Edit
:
Having
seen
your
code
","
it
seems
pretty
complicated
for
what
it
does
.
I
would
structure
it
like
this
:
Advantages
:
This
reads
every
sensor
file
in
one
go
.
It
also
removes
two
function
calls
per
sensor
.
Much
less
typing
.
In
PySide
","
I
want
to
emit
a
signal
with
the
class
that
defines
the
signal
as
a
parameter
.
E.g
.
:
However
","
the
second
line
gives
a
NameError
because
MyWidget
doesn't
exist
yet
at
that
point
.
For
now
I
work
around
the
issue
by
emitting
a
QWidget
like
this
but
I
would
prefer
a
solution
with
MyWidget
as
type
.
Any
ideas
?
It
is
possible
to
define
a
signal
after
the
class
definition
.
Your
code
would
look
like
:
You
just
don't
need
this
parameter
.
Use
QObject::sender
inside
a
slot
to
find
out
which
object
emitted
the
signal
.
This
happens
because
you
put
a
slash
at
the
end
of
the
filename
.
The
trailing
slash
causes
the
OS
to
follow
the
link
","
so
that
the
result
is
the
target
directory
which
is
not
a
link
.
If
you
remove
the
slash
","
islink
will
return
True
.
The
same
thing
happens
in
Bash
as
well
:
In
os
there's
a
function
os.path.islink(PATH)
which
checks
if
PATH
is
symlink
.
But
if
fails
when
PATH
is
a
symlink
to
some
directory
.
Instead
-
-
python
thinks
it
is
directory
(
os.path.isdir(PATH)
)
.
So
how
do
I
check
if
a
dir
is
link
?
Edit
:
Here's
what
bash
thinks
:
and
here's
what
python
thinks
:
Build
lists

several

Build

:
Print

friends

especially
with
large

that
don't
fit
into

I
searched
around

i
couldn't
find
any

to
help
me
fix
this
problem
","
I
found
similar

i
couldn't
find

thing
addressing
this
alone
anyway

Here's
the
the
problem
I
have

I'm

if
the

the
exact

the

it
prints

whole

the

you
should
use
regular

regular

return

'
20
'
.
It's
very
easy

The
check
has
to
be
like
this
:
If

We
split
up

Just
a

question
:
Is
there
a
build-in
method
to
get
the
combinations
under
the
assertion
of
commutative
property
and
excluding
elements
paired
with
itself
?
Doesn't
seem
very
Python
.
I
know
of
itertools.product
which
is
the
Cartesian
product
.
I
could
convert
it
to
a
set
which
would
exclude
the
identity-pairings
but
it's
still
the
non-commutative
product
.
you
mean
this
?
output
:
Assuming
a
and
b
are
identical
.
itertools.combinations
","
if
both
lists
are
the
same
like
here
.
Or
in
the
general
case
itertools.product
","
followed
by
some
filtering
:
Also
","
I
think
the
term
combination
already
means
that
the
order
of
elements
in
the
result
doesn't
matter
.
Ok
","
Theodros
is
right
.
For
compensation
","
here's
a
version
which
should
work
on
a
any
list
of
lists
:
gives
(
appropriately
sorted
)
And
it
also
works
on
the
previous
counterexample
l
=
[
"[1,2,3]"
","
"[1,3,4,5]"
]
:
This
will
work
if
you
do
not
care
that
the
ordering
in
the
resulting
tuples
does
not
map
to
the
input
lists

you
do
not
care
whether
(
1
","
2
)
or
(
2

1

)
.
Here
you'll
get
the
combination
with
the
smaller
element
first
:
gives
With
strings
you
get
The
apparent
difference

the
ordering
comes
from
the
different
hashes

I
have
2
input
files

I
check
if
the
2nd

input.txt
matches
the
1st
column

match

This
is
the

I
get

need
just
add
an

Pickle
recreates
objects
by
looking
up
callables
(
commonly
classes
","
but
really
any
callable
)
and
calling
them
with
fixed
arguments
.
This
means
that
unpickling
may
run
any
callable
anywhere
","
with
any
arguments
.
Even
if
the
relevant
module
hasn't
been
imported
yet
","
pickle
will
gladly
import it
.
It
takes
only
a
couple
dozen
characters
to
execute
os.system
","
for
example
.
So
you're
screwed
before
you
even
get
an
object
back
.
Unpickling
a
pickle
amounts
to
executing
arbitrary
code
.
An
attacker
can
create
a
pickle
which
will
execute
system
commands
during
unpickling
.
Here's
an
example
from
a
good
blog
post
on
the
topic
:
This
clearly
states
that
pickle
is
insecure
.
Many
think
this
is
because
it
can
load
classes
other
than
what
you
expect
and
may
trick
you
to
run
their
functions
.
But
the
actual
security
risk
is
far
more
dangerous
.
Unpickling
can
be
exploited
to
execute
arbitrary
commands
on
your
machine
!
The
pickle
format
uses
a
full-blown
virtual
machine
.
If
the
code
fed
into
the
machine
is
controlled
by
an
attacker
","
it
can
do
things
well
beyond
object
serialization
(
including
executing
arbitrary
OS
commands
)
.
For
a
discussion

Why
Python
Pickle

Insecure

In
the
Documentation

python3
pickle
module

says

What
is
the

Is
the
unpickling

dangerous

Or
is
it
only
dangerous
to
use

So
is
it
safe

In

a

resets
the

but
you
can
easily
work
around
this
by
resetting
the
index

doing
the

Resetting
the
index
will
create
a
new

""""

you

joins
the

You

use

enumerate

indicate
the
start
value

suppose

then
this
will
do
it

can
strip

the
best

do

upon
how
variable
the
phrases
are
.
For
example
","
if
you
know
it's

For
Example
:
To
this
:
While
I
know
you
can
add
a
number
count
to
each
item
on
list
I
tried
:
I
get
TypeError
:
'
function
'
object
is
not
iterable
But
this
is
new
to
me
.
I
would
normally
have
more
to
show
but
I
really
don't
have
any
Idea
how
to
code
this
at
all
.
You
can
check
whether
the
cursor
is
null
easily
:
Otherwise
the
usual
thing
in
Python
is
to
""""
ask
for
forgiveness
not
permission
""""
:
use
your
database
connection
and
if
it
has
timed
out
catch
the
exception
and
handle
it
(
otherwise
you
might
just
find
that
it
times
out
between
your
test
and
the
point
where
you
use
it
)
.
The
problem
with
checking
before
an
operation
is
that
the
bad
condition
you're
checking
for
could
happen
between
the
check
and
the
operation
.
For
example
","
suppose
you
had
a
method
is_timed_out()

check
if
the
connection
had
timed
out
:
On
the
face
of
it
","
this
looks
like
you've
avoided
the
possibility
of
a
CursorTimedOut
exception
from
the
execute
call
.
But
it's
possible
for
you
to
call
is_timed_out
","
get
a
False
back
","
then
the
cursor
times
out
","
and
then
you
call
the
execute
function
","
and
get
an
exception
.
Yes
","
the
chance
is
very
small
that
it
will
happen
at
just
the
right
moment
.
But
in
a
server
environment
","
a
one-in-a-million
chance
will
happen
a
few
times
a
day
.
Bad
stuff
.
You
have
to
be
prepared
for
your
operations
to
fail
with
exceptions
.
And
once
you've
got
exception
handling
in
place
for
those
problems
","
you
don't
need
the
pre-checks
any
more
","
because
they
are
redundant
.
I
have
functions
in
which
I
am
doing
database
operations

I
want
to
do
something
special

check
whether

and
whether

How
can
I
do
pre

a

it

using
","
say
BautifulSoup
and
determine
where
the

you
to
define
the
location

This
is
easy
for

say
","
hrefs
or
any
arbitraty
tag

gets
more
complicated
when
determining
where
the
rest

","
robots

My
scenario

","
this
question
should
be
a
duplicate
of
this
one
.
There
are
multiple
problems
here
:
Your
JSON
data
is
actually
multiple
JSON
datas
.
That
will
be
hard
to
fix
if
you
have
a
lot
of
data
","
although
Martijns
suggestion
of
reading
per
line
might
help
","
assuming
the
data
really
is
one
JSON
mapping
per
line
.
Otherwise
the
data
needs
to
be
fixed
","
like
this
:
Note
the
opening
and
closing
brackets
","
and
the
comma
after
each
JSON
{
}
(
except
the
last
one
)
.
The
script
you
have
been
given
is
not
particularly
generic
.
It
assumes
there
is
an
'
item_id
'
in
the
first
JSON
object
given
","
which
there
is
not
.
That's
fixable
","
though
.
Your
invoice_payments
data
is
a
list
of
dictionaries
.
This
means
your
data
is
hierarchical
.
How
do
you
want
to
convert
to
CVS
","
which
is
just
a
flat
list
of
data
?
It's
not
obvious
.
The
script
you
show
doesn't
deal
with
that
","
it's
generic
and
assumes
your
json
data
is
flat
.
A
fixed
converter
:
yields
this
result
as
CSV
:
Note
how
your
invoice_payments
data
has
been
converted
to
a
string
:
Nothing
that
imports
CSV
will
make
any
practical
sense
of
that
.
Your
JSON
data
can
not
be
trivially
converted
to
CSV
","
you
have
to
decide
and
specify
how
the
CSV
data
should
look
.
Someone
sent
me
this
code
to
convert

the
code

someone
can
correct
the
code

fetch
all
fields
then
that's
great
.
I
dont
even
need
all

This
has
been
pending
for
a
long
time.I
need
to
get
this
completed
today.Pls
help
.
I
am
trying
to
learn
currying
in
Python
for
my
class
and
I
have
to
overload
the
(
)
operator
for
it
.
However
","
I
do
not
understand
how
can
I
can
go
about
overloading
the
(
)
operator
.
Can
you
explain
the
logic
behind
overloading
the
parentheses
?
Should
I
overload
first
(
and
then
)
or
can
I
do
any
of
these

Also
","
is

special
name

You
can
make
an
object
callable
by
implementing
the
__call__
method
:
My
function
is
made
to
get
the
area
of
any
arbitrary
triangle
.
Here
is
the
way
that
I
know
works
However
","
I
think
this
is
crap
so
here's
what
I
had
as
a
sketched
out
thought
","
However
","
this
apparently
doesn't
play
too
nice
with
lists
.
I
thought
this
would
work
in
the
way
that
once
can
get
keys
and
values
from
dictionaries...but
lists
don't
have
the
iteritems()
method
.
Then
I
thought
about
converting
the
lists
into
dictionaries
","
but
the
keys
are
unique
in
dicts
and
hence
they
only
pop
up
once....which
would
make
my
function
not
work
properly
.
You
use
tuple
unpacking
:
Python
can
unpack
nested
sequences
into
separate
variables
","
as
long
as
you
create
the
same
nesting
structure
on
the
left-hand-side
.
The
looping
will
not
work
because
you
are
trying
to
unpack
2-value
tuples
per
loop
iteration
","
where
the
iteration
would
only
yield
only
1
value
.
This
works
across
python
versions
.
Demonstration
:
In
2.x
","
use
raw_input()
instead
of
input()
-
this
is
because
in
Python
2.x
","
input()
parses
the
user's
input
as
Python
code
","
which
is
dangerous
and
slow
.
raw_input()
just
gives
you
the
string
.
In
3.x
","
they
changed
input()
to
work
that
way
as
it
is
what
you
generally
want
.
This
is
a
simple
list
comprehension
that
takes
the
split
components
of
the
input
(
using
str.split()
","
which
splits
on
whitespace
)
and
makes
each
component
an
integer
.
In
python
3.x
In
python
2.x
In
Ruby
I
can
use
how
to
write
in
Python
self.tags
+
[
'
tag
'
]
creates
a
new
object
.
And
then
it
is
assigned
to
self.tags
.
self.tags.append
works
with
the
same
tags
object
from
the
class
.
So
all
the
objects
share
the
same
tags
object
and
append
to
it
.
I
wish
I
could
better
title
the
question
.
Anyway
","
Here
is
test.py
Here
is
the
output
:
[
'
tag
'
]
Now
I
change
class
test
to
Here
is
the
output
:
[
'
tag
'
","
'
tag
'
]
I
expected
the
first
result
[
'
tag
'
]
in
both
cases
.
Ahh
","
okay
i
found
a
solution
","
but
i'm
open
to
smarter
alternatives
:
)
This
should
do
the
trick
:
i
coded
a
little
program
and
i
am
currently
in
the
process
of
making
it
work
on
different
operating
systems
.
My
program
heavily
relies
on
the
function
count_nonzero
introduced
with
numpy
version
1.6
.
My
primary
workstation
is
Debian
Linux
with
numpy
(
ver
.
1.6.2
)
and
scipy
(
ver
.
0.11
)
.
However
on
windows
the
setup
could
involve
older
numpy
version
below
1.6
","
where
the
count_nonzero
command
isn't
available
.
Therefore
i
am
in
need
of
a
custom
count_nonzero
function
which
works
on
systems
with
older
numpy
versions
.
"def count_nonzero(self,array):"
How
can
i
achieve
this
?
First
problem
is
that
when
i
click
'
+
$16
'
button
it
doesn't
show
the
increase
","
although
you
can
see
it
after
closing
the
window
and
typing
money
into
Python
Shell
.
Second
problem
is
that
after
I
added
those
sticky=SE
and
sticky=SW
window
won't
appear
at
all
(
without
error
messages
)
.
You
store
a
new
string
based
on
the
money
variable
in
the
budget
Label
;
the
label
doesn't
keep
a
reference
to
the
money
variable
for
you
.
Simply
set
the
label
value
each
time
you
call
your
addMoney
function
:
First
of
all
","
you
are
storing
the
return
value

pack
","
which
is
always
None
","
instead
of
the
reference

Besides

you
shouldn't
use

if
you
are
new

I'd
suggest

.
To
update
the
text

you
have
to
use

As
the

very
long
I
would
prefer
if
it
covered
more

I
don't

possible

do

a
standard
listctrl

Try
poking
around
at
the
UltimateListCtrl
","
being
a
full
owner
drawn
listctrl
it
has
the
ability
to
change

way
its
looks
far
more
than
a
standard
listctrl
.
I
figured
out
how
to
do
it
.
One
way
I
found
is
to
send
mail
through
html

Okay
here
is
what
I
have

far

it

What
can
I
do
to
encode
utf-8
to
mail
api
and
make
it
works
for
using
more
than
one
language
in
the
one
email
?
Thanks
in
advance
.
.
encode('utf-8')
makes
binary
out
of
the
string
.
You
have
to
use
.
decode('utf-8')

The

it

you

Setting

the

the
'
waiting
'

Before

to
tell
Selenium
","
don't
run
this
at
normal
speed
","
run
it

","
I
login
and
once
logged
in
I
see
a

The
problem
is
the
Welcome

is
not
displayed
instantly
and
is
on
a
time
delay
(
using
jQuery

Pre
WebDriver
Code
would
dictate
to
Selenium
","
run
this
test
","
but
slow
down
here
so
we
can
wait

Newer

Now

if
you
really
want
access

set
""""
Selenium's
speed

first
off
I'd
recommend
against
it

the
solution
would
be
to
dive

the
older

now
deprecated

If
you
use

heavily
already

you
can
use
the

stay
the

taking

Below

my
code
for

Now
I
have
a
value
in
the
variable

The
output

this
will
be
:
I
want
to
take

For
example
","
the

I
want

I
could
do
this
if
I
knew
what
format
datetime
was
in
","
but
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
digits
or
anything..I
was
thinking
about
splitting
the
values
up
from
:
and
using
all
the
values
in
between
","
but
there
might
be
a
better
way
.
Ideas
?
You
have
datetime.timedelta()
objects
.
These
have
.
microseconds
","
.
seconds
and
.
days
attributes
","
all
3
integers
.
The
str()
string
representation
represents
those
as
[
D
day
[s]
","
]
[H]
H:MM:SS
[
.
UUUUUU
]
as
needed
to
fit
all
values
present
.
You
can
use
simple
arithmetic
on
these
objects
.
Summing
and
division
work
as
expected
","
for
example
:
Unfortunately
","
you
cannot
multiply
two
timedeltas
and
calculating
a
standard
deviation
thus
becomes
tricky
(
no
squaring
of
offsets
)
.
Instead
","
I'd
use
the
.
total_seconds()
method
","
to
give
you
a
floating
point
value
that
is
calculated
from
the
days
","
seconds
and
microseconds
values
","
then
use
those
values
to
calculate
a
standard
deviation
.
The
duration
objects
you
are
getting
are
timedelta
objects
.
Or
durations
from
one
timestamp
to
another
.
To
convert
them
to
a
total
number
of
microseconds
use
:
Then
calculate
the
standard
deviation
:
So
:
This
is
how
the
code

.
now
this
isn't
working
on
Linux
.
Why
this
is
happening
","
and
how
to
fix
it
?
Always
use
b
mode
when
reading

writing
pickles
(
"open(f, 'wb')"

"open(f, 'rb')"

.
To
""""
fix
""""
the
file
you
already
have
","
convert
its
newlines
using
dos2unix
.
I'm
using
Selenium
to
try
and
get
data
from
a
website
.
But
the
data
I
want
is
stored
in
'
hidden
'
tags
","
so
it's
not
visible
when
I
pull
the
source
.
Is
there
any
way
to
get
around
this
?
Are
there
different
types
of
hidden
?
I
presume
it's
hidden
because
I'm
also
using
Firebug
","
which
can
see
the
source
on
the
page
I'm
trying
to
scrape
","
but
it
'
greys-out
'
that
source
","
which
I've
read
is
an
indication
of
that
source
being
hidden
with
the
style:hidden
tag
.
One
of
my
specific
reasons
for
scraping
with
Selenium
is
to
make
sure
the
javascript
created
parts
of
each
page
are
fully
rendered
before
I
start
searching
for
content
.
I
use
this
line
to
wait
for
the
content
I
want
to
be
loaded
:
The
'
30
'
is
a
30
second
wait
timer
","
if
this
is
exceeded
then
a
TimeoutException
occurs
so
you
will
want
to
put
it
in
a
try
...
except
:
block
.
Change
my_xpath
to
match
the
tags
you
want
.
Even
if
the
style
is
marked
as
hidden
","
Selenium
can
still
see
it
.
What
is
probably
happening
is
that
the
Web
site
is
loading
the
additional
data
through
JavaScript
and
/
or
XMLHttpRequest
or
through
CSS
.
Firebug
shows
you
the
DOM
once
it
has
been
completed
.
With
a
Webdriver
you
can
pilot
the
browser
in
loading
a
page
and
interact
with
it
.
The
issue
comes
when
some
of
the
additional
information
is
given
once
there
is
a
specific
user
interaction
.
So
a
way
to
mitigate
this
would
be
to
use
webdriver
to
pilot
the
browser
and
do
the
same
sequence
of
actions
so
that
the
DOM
will
change
accordingly
.
You
might
want
to
play
with
the
CSS
to
change
the
properties
and
make
the
element
visible
too
.
Given
that
you
didn't
provide
any
code
examples
of
what
you
are
trying
to
do
","
it
is
not
realistic
to
precisely
help
you
.
But
you
will
find
plenty
of
webdriver
code
examples
in
python
in
the
official
documentation
.
Using
the
following
code
:
"printformatted(""1,Some summary"")"
gives
me
the
error
ValueError
:
need
more
than
1
value
to
unpack
","
whereas
"printformatted([""1,Some summary""])"
does
not
.
Why
?
In
the
first
case
","
you're
passing
a
string
","
so
for
status
in
statuses
iterates
over
the
string
","
character
by
character
","
which
is
not
what
you
want
.
In
the
second
case
","
you're
passing
a
list
","
so
for
status
in
statuses
iterates
over
its
elements
","
first
element
being
""""
1
","
Some
summary
""""
.
I
am
trying
to
request
a
specific
betting
amount
with
a
minimum
","
maximum
and
specific
increments
.
When
I
run
the
following
code
","
the
program
loops
over
every
element
in
the
array
rather
than
stopping
.
It
looks
like
your
code
would
be
better
off
as
an
expression
than
a
loop
:
I
believe
everything
you've
stated
is
correct
.
On
Linux
","
os.pipe
is
just
a
Python
interface
for
accessing
traditional
POSIX
pipes
.
On
Windows
","
it's
implemented
using
CreatePipe
.
When
you
call
it
","
you
get
two
ordinary
file
descriptors
back
.
It's
unidirectional
","
and
you
just
write
bytes
to
it
on
one
end
that
get
buffered
by
the
kernel
until
someone
reads
from
the
other
side
.
It's
fairly
low-level
","
at
least
by
Python
standards
.
multiprocessing.Pipe
objects
are
much
more
high
level
interface
","
implemented
using
multiprocessing.Connection
objects
.
On
Linux
","
these
are
actually
built
on
top
of
POSIX
sockets
","
rather
than
POSIX
pipes
.
On
Windows
","
they're
built
using
the
CreateNamedPipe
API
.
As
you
noted
","
multiprocessing.Connection
objects
can
send
/
receive
any
picklable
object
","
and
will
automatically
handle
the
pickling
/
unpickling
process
","
rather
than
just
dealing
with
bytes
.
They're
capable
of
being
both
bidirectional
and
unidirectional
.
Recently
I'm
studying
parallel
programming
tools
in
Python
.
And
here
are
two
major
differences
between
os.pipe
and
multiprocessing.Pipe.(despite
the
occasion
they
are
used
)
os.pipe
is
unidirectional
","
multiprocessing.Pipe
is
bidirectional

I
want
to
know
if
my
understanding
is
correct

is
there
other
difference
?
Thank
you
.
I
am
using
SimPy
","
and
I
try
to
simulate
a
network
.
This
is
my
main
module
:
I
want
an
object
of
class
message
","
which
is
activated
by
an
object
of
class
node
","
to
interrrupt
an
object
of
class
Network
(
topology
)
.
But
I'm
getting
an
error
:
And
I
don't
know
how
to
make
an
object
global
.
And
if
I
type
topology
in
python
shell
then
it
shows
me
object
topology
","
so
why
can't
message
see
it
?
I'm
pretty
sure
the
issue
is
that
your
Message
class
is
defined
in
a
different
module
than
where
your
topology
variable
is
.
So
called
""""
global
""""
variables
in
Python
are
not
really
global
(
in
the
sense
that
there's
just
one
global
namespace
)
","
but
just
at
the
top
of
a
specific
module's
namespace
.
So
the
global
variable
topology
in
your
main
module's
namespace
is
not
accessible
as
a
global
variable
from
a
different
module
.
My
suggestion
for
working
around
this
by
passing
the
topology
value
to
the
Message
as
a
parameter
to
the
__init__
method
.
If
the
message
is
being
created
by
something
other
than
your
own
code
(
e.g
.
by
your
Node
class
)
","
you
might
need
to
pass
it
around
a
bit
more
","
so
that
it
will
be
available
when
needed
.
If
that
is
not
possible
","
you
might
be
able
to
put
the
topology
value
in
the
namespace
of
a
module
that
can
be
imported
by
your
Message
code
.
This
can
get
messy
though
","
as
circular
imports
can
break
things
if
you're
not
careful
.
Python
applies
line
buffering
when
connected
to
a
TTY
","
otherwise
a
larger
buffer
is
needed
.
Redirecting
your
Python
program
to
a
pipe
means
there
is
no
TTY
connected
to
the
stream
","
and
you'll
have
to
use
.
flush()
even
when
sending
newlines
.
You
can
run
Python
with
-
u
to
turn
off
buffering
of
stdout
.
I
have
a
wrapper
to
redirect
outputs
when
I
call
python
python-wrapped
C
+
+
.
The
basic
idea
is
to
use
dup
and
dup2
","
which
are
the
only
ways
I've
been
able
to
catch
the
printf
outputs
from
the
C
+
+
.
The
wrapper
works
fine
with
no
calls
to
flush()
as
long
as
I'm
running
the
job
interactively
","
but
when
I
send
the
job
to
a
TORQUE
batch
I
get
the
unwelcome
outputs
again
.
My
understanding
","
in
part
from
this
question
","
is
that
some
well-placed
flush()
calls
should
fix
this
","
but
where
exactly
do
they
need
to
go
?
Should
I
flush
the
buffer
before
dup'ing
to
the
tempfile
?
Before
dup'ing
back
?
Both
?
The
wrapper
I'm
using
is
as
follows
:
Simply
use
string
formatting
:
The
version
of
your
program
is
not
going
to
change
during
it's
(
short
","
showing
commandline
help
only
)
lifetime
","
so
you
only
need
to
interpolate
this
once
.
Currently
I
use
I'd
like
to
have
the

be
a

.
I
tried
various
things
with
no
luck
...
I
am
trying
to
use
AFHTTPClient
to
connect
with
a
tornado
server
.
Here
is
my
code
from
client
:
On
the
server
side
","
I
setup
the
handler
as
bellow
:
Then
built
a
subclass
of
this
handler
:
But
when
I
run
this
code
","
it
failed
with
following
ERROR
message
:
The
strange
thing
is

the

","
it's
clearly
showing

Then
why
the

still
has
no

'
json_args

?
I
am
using
tornado
3.0
.
Thanks
you
very
much
if
you
could
give
me
any
advice
.
It
turns
out
this
is
cause
by
the
Content-Type
setting
:
On
the
BaseHandler
:
But
actually
in
the
request
header
:
'
Content-Type
'
:
'
application
/
json
;
charset=utf-8
'
This
string
doesn't
match

all

But
even
after
setting
the
Content-Type
=
""""
application
/
json
""""
from
the
client
","
the
string
appended
""""
;
charset=utf-8
""""
again
.
The
only
way
I
fixed
this
is
change
the
basehandler
code
to
:
It
fixed
my
problem
.
But
still
","
anybody
know
where
""""

come
from
?
Is
it
automatically
set
up
by
AFNetworking
?
Thanks
!
One
way
is
just
:
You
can
also
do
this
:
You
want
to
import the
User
modules
in
the
package
__init__.py
files
to
make
them
available
as
attributes
.
So
in
both
Helper
/
__init_.py
and
Controller
/
__init__.py
add
:
This
makes
the
module
an
attribute
of
the
package
and
you
can
now
refer
to
it
as
such
.
Alternatively
","
you'd
have
to
import the
modules
themselves
in
full
:
so
refer
to
them
with
their
full
names
.
Another
option
is
to
rename
the
imported
name
with
as
:
I
have
started
to

I
do
it
.

tried
using
the
following
but
it
fails
:

certainly
ambiguous
.
The
other
(
c
+
+
way
of
doing
it
)
way
that
I
can
think
of
is
But
when
above
script
is
run

it
gives
the

I
agree
with
@Martijn
because
doc
says
so
","
but
if
you
are
focused
on
unix

","
then
you
can
make

If
you

dev
/
shm
folder
","
all

so
you
can
use
to
access
the-same

it
takes
that
much
time
:

the
same
command

:
so
basically
this

Is
it

to
access

From
the

documentation

So
","
opening

the
filename
""""

""""
will
create
two
independent
in-memory
databases
.
This
is
different
from
an
on-disk
database
","
where
creating
multiple
connections
with
the
same
connection
string
means
you
are
connecting
to
one
database
.
Within
one
process
it
is
possible

share
an

This
is
what
I
have
gathered
going
from
various
stackflow
questions
","
tutorials

modules
.
So
far
no
success
.
My
main
issue
is
that
I
am
unfamiliar
with
how
I
get
python
to
give
me
a
range
of
dates
(
here
being
the
year
2013
","
but
it
could
also
be
just
any
increment
in
time
such
as
June
2011
to
December
2014
)
and
of
course
to
print
the
day
of
the
week

it

This
way
it
could
be
adapted
to
any
time
period
you
might
need
this
small
calendar
for
.
I
was
thinking
maybe
assigning
every
day's
number
(
1
being
Monday
","
2
being
Tuesday
is
the
pattern
if
I'm
correct
)
the
first
3
letters
of
a
day
in
the
week
so
it's
all
neat
and
of
the
same
length
.
Here's
one
way
to
do
the
looping
:
this
will
print
to
stdout
so
you
can
redirect
it
to
a
file
from
the
console
","
which
is
the
usual
but
if
you
want
to
write
to
the
file
directly
from
the
script
replace
the
last
two
lines
with
this
:
In

what's
the

use

You
can
use
the
astype

the
entire

you
can

:
pd.Factor

been
deprecated

Factor

Categorical
are
the
same

as
far
as
I
know
.
I
think
it
was
initially
called
Factor
","
and
then
changed
to
Categorical
.
To
convert
to
Categorical
maybe
you
can
use
pandas.Categorical.from_array
","
something
like
this
:
I'd
suggest
you
write
a
function
to
walk
your
datastructure
and
call
a
function

each
node
.
Updated
to
avoid
the
""""

the

The
walk
function
calls
the

The
work

I
am
still
a
beginner
Pythonist
so
please
forgive
the
brute-forceness
.
Here's
a
sample
dictionary
formatted
for
easy
copy
and
paste
.
In
this
dictionary
the
only
tree
that
should
remain
is
/
root
/
dc-1
/
group-3
.
The
group-11
folder
should
be
deleted
first
","
then
its
parent
(
since
the
child
is
no
longer
there
)
","
etc.
I
have
tried
many
different
recursive
methods
but
can't
seem
to
get
it
to
work
properly
.
Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
.
For
one
","
you
could
catch
the
exception
","
print
it
and
see
what
it
is
:

Do
this
","
for
instance
by
surrounding
it
all
with
a
try
/
except
clause
and
printing
whatever
exception
occurs
.
I'm
guessing
the
reason
for
this
is
client
disconnect
.
This
will
cause
an
exception
and
you
should
handle
it
appropriately
.
If
a
client
can
disconnect

many
ways

telling

by
timing

by
dropping
the

send
something

All
these
scenarios
are
plausible
exception
cases
","

test

favored

Python

better

PS
.
:
I
don't
think
there
is
ever
a

The
operator.methodcaller

exactly
what

Alternatively
you
can
use

I
have
downloaded

However
","
I
am
unable

the
Python
Shell

How
can
I
do
so
?
From
looking
at
the
faq
","
it
looks
like
what
you
need
to
do
is
add
the
following
line
to
your
Python
file
:
Then
","
it
looks
like
you
need
to
run
your
script
by
using
the
Python
interpreter
bundled
with
Sage
from
the
command
line
/
console
:
However
","
if
you
want
to
use
Sage
directly
from
the
shell
","
you
should
probably
try
using
the
interactive
shell
.
(
just
type

sage

maybe
sage

python
from
the
command
line
)
Caveat
:
I
haven't
tested
any
of
this
myself
","
so
you
might
need
to
do
a
bit
of
experimenting
to
get
everything
to
work
.
This
entirely
depends
on
the
authentication
policy
that
you
use
.
The
default
AuthTktAuthenticationPolicy
sets
a
cookie
in
the
browser
which
(
by
default
)
does
not
expire

Again
though
","
this
depends
on
how
you
are
tracking
authenticated
users

I
am
making
a
pyramid
webapp
running
in
apache
webserver
using
mod_wsgi
.
Is
there
anyway
I
could
make
user
session
never
timed
out
?
(
The
idea
is
so
that
once
user
logged
in
","
the
system
will
never
kicked
them
out
unless
they
logged
out
themselves
)
.
I
cant
find
any
information

this

Attribute
names
with
double
underscores
are
""""
mangled
""""
to
make
it
harder
to
have
conflicting
name
in
subclasses
.
So
use
single
underscores
.
This
is
because
name
mangling
is
happening
.
expressionType
is
defined
in
Expression
.
n.__expressionType
will
translate
to
n._Expression__expressionType
.
if
you
copy-paste
the
same
expressionType
method
to
the
class
Number
","
then
because
of
method
resolution
order
","
it
would
go
the
the
definition

Number
where

mean

.
n._Expression__expressionType
!

This
would
actually
work
:
However
","
there
is
code
duplication
","
so
using
a
single
underscore
is
better
because
it
won't
mangle
the
name
of
the
attribute
.
As
the
others
have
pointed
out
","
""""
namemangling
""""
occurs
.
But
what
the
hell
is
that
?
Let's
see
with
an
example
.
Create
an
instance
of
A
:
Access
the
first
variable
of
A

Access
the
second
variable
of
A

Notice
the

no
attribute
'
__var2
'
.
However
you
can
can
access
it
fine
with
:
So
simply
put
","
whenever
you
have
two
doublescores
(
or
more
)
infront
of
a
method
or
a
variable
","
Python
changes
the
name
of
that
method

variable
by
appending
an
underscore
and
the
classname
to
it
.
This
a
sort
of
trick
so
programmers
don't
screw
up
things
by
mistakenly
changing
values
.
I
am
unsure
what
I
am
doing
wrong
;
or
why
this
is
the
case
.
I've

following
code
:

Now
if

","
it
all
works
.
I
understand
the
difference
between
private

semi-private
variables
but
why
this
is
happening
—
I've
no
idea
.
Also

I've
used
""""

""""
in
a
number
of
other
places

it

to
work
fine

acceptable

that's
going
to
be

If

want
to
change
the
original

Implementation
:
Usage
:
So
it
is
a
generator
-
you'll
need
to
call
list
or
something
to
make
it
permanent
.
If
you
only
ever
want
to
remove

you
can

course
make
it
even
faster
by
using
k
=
=
remove_index
instead
of
a
set
.
If
it
is
important
that
you
want
to
remove
a
specific
element
(
as
opposed
to
just
filtering
)
","
you'll
want
something
close
to
the
following
:
You
may
also
consider
using
a
set
here
to
be
more
semantically
correct
if
indeed
your
problem
is
related
to
playing
cards

This
question
has
been
answered
but
I
wanted
to
address
the
comment
that
using
list
comprehension
is
much
slower
than
using
.
remove()
.
Some
profiles
from
my
machine
(
using
Python
2.7.6
)
.
If
you
use
the
fastest
way
to
copy
a
list
(
which
isn't
very
readable
)
","
you
will
be
about
36
%
faster
than
using
list
comprehension
.
But
if
you
copy
the
list
by
using
the
list()
class
(
which
is
much
more
common
and
Pythonic
)
","
then
you're
going
to
be
26
%
slower
than
using
list
comprehension
.
Really
","
it's
all
pretty
fast
.
I
think
the
argument
could
be
made
that
.
remove()
is
more
readable
than
list
a
list
comprehension
technique
","
but
it's
not
necessarily
faster
unless
you're
interested
in
giving
up
readability
in
the
duplication
.
The
big
advantage
of
list
comprehension
in
this
scenario
is
that
it's
much
more
succinct
(
i.e.
if
you
had
a
function
that
was
to
remove
an
element
from
a
given
list
for
some
reason
","
it
could
be
done
in
1
line
","
whilst
the
other
method
would
require
3
lines
.
)
There
are
times
in
which
one-liners
can
be
very
handy
(
although
they
typically
come
at
the
cost
of
some
readability
)
.
Additionally
","
using
list
comprehension
excels
in
the
case
when
you
don't
actually
know
if
the
element
to
be
removed
is
actually
in
the
list
to
begin
with
.
While
.
remove()
will
throw
a
ValueError
","
list
comprehension
will
operate
as
expected
.
If
you
don't
need
a
seperate
noclubs
The
proper
way
to
do
this
is
to
use
a
loop
as
you
mentioned
.
Any
other
solution
will
be
semantically
incorrect
.
(
What
you
are
saying
is
""""
For
each
item
in
L
","
do
f

That
is

Question

prefix

if

Each

append

also
use

quickly
rule
out

large
fraction

you
only

to
fall

searching

check

Short
answer
:
if
you
have
some
gigabytes
of
RAM
","
use
Python
dictionaries

it's
the
easiest

the
faster

run

can
do
something
like
this
:
And
then
check
if
the
key
exists

the
mapping

answer
:
you
can
use
a
persistent
key-value
store
","
like
GDBM
(
it
looks
like
Berkeley
DB
)

but
this
approach
will
be
way
slower
than
using
just
Python
dictionaries

on
the
other
hand
","
with
this
approach
you'll
have
persistance

if
you
need
)
.
You
can
understand
GDBM
as
a
dictionary
(
key-value
store
)
that
is
persisted
in
a
single
file
.
You
can
use
it
as
follows
:
Then
the
file
my.db
will
be
created
(
see
Python
GDBM
documentation
to
understand
what
cf
means
)
.
But
it
has
some
limitations
","
as
supporting
only
strings

The

is
that
you
can't
reconstruct

that

causing
that
?
Any
help

EDIT
Have
look
at
raw
frames
:
Of
course
these
numbers
are
a
bit
random
(
due
to
masking
)
","
but
note
that
second
byte
(
which
is
supposed
to
represent
the
length
of
payload
)
is
134
","
then
133
and
then
always
132
.
Also
first
two
frames
are
longer
then
other
frames
.
What's
going
on
here
?
I've
just
looked
at
this
frames
one
more
time
and
I've
realized
that
the
first
byte
:
which
according
to
the
specification
means
that
RSV1
is
used
(
the
second
bit
is
1
)
.
This
seems
to
mean
that
the
extension
is
used
and
indeed
in
my
handshake
code
I've
found
the
following
line
:
and
in
Chrome
I
can
see
:
when
I
do
the
handshake
.
I'm
not
sure
yet
how
these
extensions
work
but
removing
these
3
lines
from
the
handshake
code
fixes
the
issue
.
I
have
a
NumPy
array
that
stores
the
information
of
a
signal
.
In
the
code
below
I
have
just
created
it
from
random
numbers
for
convenience
.
Now
I
need
to
select
positions
from
the
signal
array
","
based
on
criteria
.
Again
","
I
have
simplified
the
criteria
below
","
for
sake
of
brevity
.
I
am
trying
to
store
those
positions
by
appending
them
to
an
empty
NumPy
array
called
positions
.
I
know
that
my
use
of
the
NumPy.append()
function
must
be
wrong
.
I
tried
to
debug
it
","
but
I
cannot
find
the
bug
.
What
am
I
doing
wrong
?
EDIT
:
I
actually
need
this
to
run
in
a
for
loop
","
since
my
condition
in
the
if()
is
a
mathematical
expression
that
will
be
changed
according
to
some
rule
(
that
would
be
way
to
complicated
to
post
here
)
if
the
condition
is
met
.
You
don't
need
an
explicit
loop
for
this
:
Here
","
(
signal
%
3
=
=
0
)
|
(
signal
%
5
=
=
0
)
evaluates
the
criterion
on
every
element
of
signal
","
and
np.where()
returns
the
indices
where
the
criterion
is
true
.
If
you
have
to
append
to
positions
in
a
loop
","
here
is
one
way
to
do
it
:
Yes
","
there
is
a
good
reason
not
to
start
all
your
Python
programs
like
that
.
First
of
all
:
sys.stdout.encoding
is
None
if
Python
doesn't
know
what
encoding
the
stdout
supports
.
This
","
in
most
cases
","
is
because
it
doesn't
really
support
any
encoding
at
all
.
In
your
case
it's
because
the
stdout
is
a
file
","
and
not
a
terminal
.
But
it
could
be
set
to
None
because
Python
also
fails
to
detect
the
encoding
of
the
terminal
.
Second
of
all
:
You
set
the
environment
variable
and
then
start
a
new
process
with
the
smae
command
again
.
That's
pretty
ugly
.
So
","
unless
you
plan
to
be
the
only
one
using
your
programs
","
you
shouldn't
start
them
like
that
.
But
if
you
do
plan
to
be
the
only
using
your
program
","
then
go
ahead
.
More
in-depth
explanation
A
better
generic
solution
under
Python
2
is
to
treat
stdout
as
what
it
is
:
An
8-bit
interface
.
And
that
means
that
anything
you
print
to
to
stdout
should
be
8-bit
.
You
get
the
error
when
you
are
trying
to
print
Unicode
data
","
because
print
will
then
try
to
encode
the
Unicode
data
to
the
encoding
of
stdout
","
and
if
it's
None
it
will
assume
ASCII
","
and
fail
","
unless
you
set
PYTHONIOENCODING
.
But
by
printing
encoded
data
","
you
don't
have
this
problem
.
The
following
works
perfectly
even
when
the
output
is
piped
:
(
However
","
this
will
fail
Under
Python
3
","
because
under
Python
3
","
stdout
is
no
longer
8-bit
IO
","
you
are
supposed
to
give
it
Unicode
data
","
and
it
will
encode
by
itself
.
If
you
give
it
binary
data
","
it
will
print
the
representation
.
Therefore
on
Python
3
you
don't
have
this
problem
in
the
first
place
)
.
Is
there
a
good
reason
why
I
shouldn't
start
all
my
python
programs
with
this
?
Is
there
something
special
lost
when
doing
exec
like
this
?
There
are
60
questions
about
PYTHONIOENCODING
so
I
guess
it's
a
common
problem
","
but
in
case
you
don't
know
","
this
is
done
because
when
sys.stdout.encoding
=
=
None
then
you
can
only
print
ascii
chars
","
so
e.g
.
print
""""
åäö
""""
will
throw
an
exception
.
.
EDIT
This
happens
to
me
when
stdout
is
a
pipe
;
python
encoding.py|cat
will
set
encoding
to
None
Another
solution
is
to
change
the
codec
of
stdout
sys.stdout
=
codecs.getwriter('utf8')
(
sys.stdout
)
which
I'm
guessing
is
the
correct
answer
dispite
the
comments
on
that
question
.
The
issue
with
me
was
that
I
installed
python
","
cx_oracle
as
root
but
Oracle
client
installation
was
done
by
""""
oracle
""""
user
.
I
got
my
own
oracle
installation
and
that
fixed
the
issue
.
Later
I
ran
into
PyUnicodeUCS4_DecodeUTF16
issues
with
Python
and
for
that
I
had
to
install
python
with

option
I
have
installd

have

and
installed

2.7
&
Oracle
11g
.
But
ldd
command
on
cx_oracle
is
unable
to
find
libclntsh.so.11.1
.
I
tried

","
updated

.
Tried
all
possible
solutions
that
have
been
discussed

this
issue

the
forums
","
but
no

.

let
me
know

am
missing

want
to
remove
the
punctuation

can't

should
I
go
about
this
?
Edit
:
I
thought
about
using
the
strip()
function
but
that
will
only
take
effect
on
the
right
and
left
trailing
of
the
whole
sentence
.
For
example
:
Should
become
:
Instead
of
the
current
output
:
Is
this
what
u
want
?
Assuming
you
consider
words
as
groups
of
characters
separated
by
spaces
:
or
I
have
tried
using
textwrap
on
the
labels
and
it
works
for
me
.
Inserting
this
in
your
code
gives
us
:
I've
been
trying
to
wrap
text
for
long
labels
in
my
code
.
I
tried
the
textwrap
method
suggested
earlier
here
","
but
my
code
defines
yticklabels
through
an
array
imported
from
a
csv
using
the
pyplot.setp()
method
.
I'm
using
tight_layout()
for
the
formatting
otherwise
.
So
the
question
is
-
is
there
a
way
to
wrap
the
really
long
y
labels
to
newlines
easily
?
Here
is
some
sample
code
that
I'd
like
a
fix
for
:
This
plots
something
like
this
I'd
like
the
labels
to
go
to
newlines
after
a
fixed
width
.
Any
ideas
?
New
to
scikit-learn
and
I
am
working
with
some
data
like
the
following
.
For
single
lines
of
text
there
is
CountVectorizer
and
DictVectorizer
in
the
pipeline
before
TfidfTransformer
.
The
output
of
these
could
be
concatenated
","
I'm
hoping
with
the
following
caveat
:
The
arbitrary
text
I
don't
want
to
be
equal
in
importance
to
the
specific
","
limited
and
well-defined
parameters
.
Finally
","
some
other
questions
","
possibly
related
might
this
data
structure
indicate
which
SVM
kernel
is
best
?
Or
would
a
Random
Forest
/
Decision
Tree
","
DBN
","
or
Bayes
classifier
possibly
do
better
in
this
case
?
Or
an
Ensemble
method
?
(
The
output
is
multi-class
)
I
see
there
is
an
upcoming
feature
for
feature
union
","
but
this
is
to
run
different
methods
over
the
same
data
and
combine
them
.
Should
I
be
using
feature
selection
?

a
flat
feature
representation
for
samples
","
so
you'll
probably
want
to
turn
your
string
feature
into
a
vector
.
First
","
let
get
some
incorrect
assumptions
out
of
the
way
:
DictVectorizer
is
not
for
handling
""""
lines
of
text
""""
","
but
for
arbitrary
symbolic
features
.
CountVectorizer
is
also
not
for
handling
lines
","
but
for
entire
text
documents
.
Whether
features
are
""""
equal
in
importance
""""
is
mostly
up
to
the
learning
algorithm
","
though
with
a
kernelized
SVM
","
you
can
assign
artificially
small
weights
to
features
to
make
its
dot
products
come
out
differently
.
I'm
not
saying
that's
a
good
idea
","
though
.
There
are
two
ways
of
handling
this
kind
of
data
:
Build
a
FeatureUnion
consisting
of
a
CountVectorizer
(
or
TfidfVectorizer
)
for
your
textual
data
and
a
DictVectorizer
for
the
additional
features
.
Manually
split
the
textual
data
into
words
","
then
use
each
word
as
a
feature
in
a
DictVectorizer
","
e.g
.
Then
the
related
questions
:
might
this
data
structure
indicate
which
SVM
kernel
is
best
?
Since
you're
handling
textual
data
","
try
a
LinearSVC
first
and
a
polynomial
kernel
of
degree
2
if
it
doesn't
work
.
RBF
kernels
are
a
bad
match
for
textual
data
","
and
cubic
or
higher-order
poly
kernels
tend
to
overfit
badly
.
As
an
alternative
to
kernels
","
you
can
manually
construct
products
of
individual
features
and
train
a
LinearSVC
on
that
;
sometimes
","
that
works
better
than
a
kernel
.
It
also
gets
rid
of
the
feature
importances
issue
as
a
LinearSVC
learns
per-feature
weights
.
Or
would
a
Random
Forest
/
Decision
Tree
","
DBN
","
or
Bayes
classifier
possibly
do
better
in
this
case
?
That's
impossible
to
tell
without
trying
.
scikit-learn's
random
forests
and
dtrees
unfortunately
don't
handle
sparse
matrices
","
so
they're
rather
hard
to
apply
.
DBNs
are
not
implemented

Should
I
be
using
feature
selection
?
Impossible

Except
SVMs

you
implement
custom
kernels
","
which
is
such
an
advanced
topic
that
I
won't
discuss
it
now
.
One
solution
is
to
provide
the
__name__
explicitly
in
your
execution
dict
:
You
could
use
imp.load_module
instead
:
This
imports
the
file
as
the
__main__
module
","
executing
it
.
Note
that
it
takes
an
actual
file
object
when
the
type
is
set
to
imp.PY_SOURCE
","
so
you'd
need
to
create
a
temporary
file
for
this
to
work
if
your
source
code
comes
from
somewhere
other
than
a
file
.
Otherwise
","
can
always
set
__name__
manually
:
When
I
run
:
it
prints
__main__
.
But
when
I
run
:
it
prints
__builtin__
.
How
to
make
the
second
example
to
also
print
__main__
?
What
I
try
to
achieve
is
to
run
a
piece
of
code
with
exec
so
that
from
the
perspective
of
the
it
looks
like
it
was
run
from
command
line
.
I
would
like
to
tun
the
code
with
clean
scope

the
second
example
breaks
the
code
relying
on

__name__
=

the

If

if
they

just
set
a

have

when
I
flush

when

everything
works
just
fine

someone

I
wrote

extend
that

i
just
want
to
have

a

way
to
copy

corrects
the
error

your
original

copies
the

recommend
using
a
dictionary
with
names

lists

both
the

as
a

the
sums

should
maintain
a

Traverse
through
the

Example
code
:
Now
write
it
back

the
output

I
have
a
simple
python
script

it
displays
a
much
higher
execution
time

it's
run
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
.
If
I
execute
it
immediately
after
it's
faster
by
a
few
factors
.
This
script
is
run
on
a
private
test
server
with
no
applications
running
on
it
so
I
don't
think
a
lack
of
system
resources
is
what
is
causing
it
to
run
slower
.
Can
anyone
explain
the
variance
in
the
execution
time
?
I've
ran
similar
tests
for
php
scripts
that
include
external
scripts
and
there's
negligible
variance
in
the
execution
time
of
that
script
.
This
variance
affects
my
application
because
such
scripts
are
called
several
times
and
cause
the
response
to
be
delivered
between
70ms
and
450ms
.
There
can
be
several
factors
.
Two
I
can
think
off
of
right
now
:
Initial
byte
compilation
.
Python
caches
the
compiled
bytecode

first
run
that

needs
to
be
created
","
subsequent
runs

to
verify
the
timestamp

the
byte
code

quite

ran
other
things

","
those
files
will
be
flushed
from
the
cache
and
need
to
be
loaded
again
.
The
same
applies
to
directory
listings

the
checks
for
where

find
the
modules
in

search
path
and
tests
for
bytecode
caches

are
sped
up
by

directory
information
.
If
such
startup
times
affect
your

calls

comprehension

a
list
of
vertices
and
the
length
between
them

I
want
to
create
a
function
which
finds
the
distance
between
2
vertices
in
the
list
by
searching
through
the
list

the
list
will
look
something
like

Say
the
vertices
are
X

Y
could
I
index
the
list
using
X
","
Y
to
find
the
length
between
X
and
Y

Currently
I
am
doing
it
like
this
:
But
as
the
list
of
lengths
grows

Check
whether
it
is
an
instance
of
types.FunctionType
:
Probably
you'd
be
safer
to
check
for
"isinstance(X, (types.FunctionType, types.LambdaType)"
.
C
functions
are
instances
of
builtin_function_or_method
:
You
can
access
this
type
as
types.BuiltinFunctionType
/
types.BuiltinMethodType
.
Alternatively
you
can
check
whether
the
function
has
a
__code__
attribute
.
Since
C
functions
do
not
have
bytecode
","
they
can't
have
__code__
.
Note
sometimes
what
seems
like
a
function
is
actually
a
class
","
e.g
.
enumerate
but
some
3rd
party
library
may
do
the
same
.
This
means
that
you
should
also
check
whether
a
class
is
implemented
in
C
or
not
.
This
one
is
harder
since
all
classes
are
instances
of
type
.
A
way
may
be
to
check
whether
the
class
has
a
__dict__
in
its
dir
","
and
if
it
doesn't
have
you
should
check
for
__slots__
.
Something
like
the
following
should
be
pretty
accurate
:
Example
usage
:
Well
","
you
wrote
your

You
can
write

be
used

To
handle
a
default
parameter
even
if
it
might
be
None
Here's
a
really
useful
pair
of
patterns
for
this
kind
of
stuff
:
If
you
use
both
of
these
tricks
consistently
","
you
can
transparently
handle
cases
where
your
maya
queries
have
returned
None
instead
of
a
list
As
an
aside
","
you
can
mimic
the
default
maya
behaviour
(
where
passing
no
arguments
uses
the
current
selection
)
like
this
:
If
you
want
a
parameter
to
be
optional
","
you
need
to
provide
a
default
value
:
regexes
are
strings
","
so
feel
free
to
use
your
favorite
string
formatting
construct
:
As
to
your
edited
question
","
I
can't
find
an
easy
way
to
do
that
with
regexps
","
how
about
the
following
?
Say
for
example
I
want
to
match
a
substring
if
it
contains
a
certain
number
of
some
character
.
However
","
I
don't
know
the
exact
amount
that
character
is
","
but
I
know
it
is
not
negative
.
How
would
I
write
this
regex
?
Is
this
possible
to
do
?
If
so
","
how
do
I
do
it
?
EDIT
:
Example
input
:
k
=
2
string
=
01010
Expected
output
:
""""
101
""""
","
""""
0101
""""
","
""""
1010
""""
","
""""
01010
""""
So
in
each
substring
","
it
contains
exactly
2
characters
'
1
'
Perhaps
the
weight
parameter
would
be
of
help
in
your

","

just
make

bar
plot

change

with
some
bins
(
possibly
non-uniformly
spaced
)
and
the
function
automatically
calculates

then
plots
the
histogram
.
I
already
have
histogram
data

I
simply
want

plot
it

When
I
try
to
install
mongoengine
in
virtualenv
","
I've
got
problem
:
Would
be
nice
to
find
out
how
to
install
it
inside
virtualenv
.
The
error
message
says
that
installer
tries
to
delete
file
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
json_util.py
but
it
fails
because
you
don't
have
permissions
.
There
are
two
possible
reasons
:
You
are
trying
to
install
mongoengine
as
a
different
user
from
the
one
who
own
the
virtualenv
.
Let's
assume
that
you
are
logged
in
as
user
holms
so
your
bash
prompt
looks
like
:
[
holms@localhost
~
]
$
Now
check
ownership
of
virtualenv
with
:
ls
-
la
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
|
grep
backend
If
the
output
should
look
like
:
drwxr-xr-x
.
9
holms
holms
4096
05-06
15:49
backend
If
instead
of
holms
you
get
for
example
bruce
then
virtualenv
is
owned
by
this
user
and
you
should
perform
installation
as
bruce
:
sudo
su
-
bruce
source
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
bin
/
activate
pip
install
mongoengine
You
are
logged
in
as
the
correct
user
but
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
json_util.py
is
owned
by
someone
else
.
Again
I'm
assuming
that
your
username
is
holms
.
Check
permissions
:
ls
-
la
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
|
grep
json_util.py
If
you
see
that
someone
else
e.g
.
bruce
owns
this
specific
file
then
change
the
ownerschip
:
sudo
chown
holms:holms
/
var
/
www
/
msgapp
/
backend
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
/
bson
/
Now
you
should
be
able
to
install
mongoengine
.
Your
issue
lies
in
your
post_save
hook
on
Product
.
When
you
save
a
Product
in
your
ProductAdmin
","
save_model()
is
called
and
then
save_related()
.
This
in
turn
calls
save_formset
with
a
formset
for
ProductMetricals
that
contains
a
key
to
a
ProductMetricals
that
is
now
deleted
.
It
is
now
invalid
(
since
you
deleted
it
with
your
save
on
Product
)
.
I
ran
into
a
similar
issue
with
deleting
on
an
inline
that
had
a
relationship
with
another
inline
in
the
admin
view
.
I
ended
up
setting
on_delete=models.SET_NULL
for
my
foreign
key
relationship
since
by
default
Django
cascade
deletes
.
Another
option
would
be
to
manually
override
the
formset
.
It
looks
similar
to
what
was
discussed
in

i
fixed

so
i
am
posting
it
too

I
made
a
few
changes
to
your
code
.
First
I
used
get()
to
fetch
the
parameters

you
don't
need

use
the

have
it
returning

sense
to
only

enter

Their
is
an
option
introduced
in
0.13.1

might
have
been
0.13.0
)
","
where
you
can
set
dropna=False
on
a
put
/
append
to
avoid
dropping
an
all-NaN
row
.
This
is
done
for
efficiency
","
as
most
of
the
time
in

","
you

lots

no
reason

Otherwise
the

Note
that

you
are
appending
the
frequency

NOT
be
preserved

you
append
multiple
times

You
can
always
pd.infer_freq(an_index)
if
you
need
to
re-infer
the
freqency

if
possible

Normally
this

done
automatically

any

needed

the

read

a

That

not

You
would
most
probably
need
to
have
a
variable
to
detect

you
exit
your
loop
prematurely

then
break
from
the
outer
loop

Otherwise
","
maybe
the
else
clause
of
python
loops
may
help
somehow

throw
anything

versions

how

The

no
searching

be
required

How
can
I
get
pymunk

search
the
right
location

I
think
it
has
to
do
with
how
pymunk
tries
to
find
the
path

The
whole
solution
is
:
You
can
use
the
psycopg2.extensions.AsIs
to
pass
in
parameters
for
database
name
etc.
As
said
here
:
http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/usage.html#the-problem-with-the-query-parameters
Warning
Never
","
never
","
NEVER
use
Python
string
concatenation
(
+
)
or
string
parameters
interpolation
(
%
)
to
pass
variables
to
a
SQL
query
string
.
Not
even
at
gunpoint
.
Your
code
would
look
like
:
The
conn.autocommit=True
is
there
because
you
can't
create
a
database
inside
a
transaction
.
EDIT
:
Note
that
you
will
still
be
vulnerable
to
SQL
injection
when
using
AsIs
","
but
you
can
at
least
execute
queries
in
the
usual
way
(
and
CREATE
DATABASE
cannot
be
executed
from
multi-command
string
","
so
it
would
still
fail
for
new_dbname
=
my_db;DROP
DATABASE
another_db
;
-
-
)
In
the
first
query
","
your
variables
are
identifiers
","
whereas
in
the
second
they're
literal
strings
.
You
shouldn't
be
putting
parenthesis
with
the
identifiers
","
and
they
shouldn't
be
wrapped
in
single
quotes
unless
you
further
wrap
them
with
double
quotes
.
For
instance
","
this
would
create
a
table
called
'
foo
'
rather
than
foo
:
And
these
would
all
spit
out
errors
:
If
you
really
want
to
use
parameters
for
identifiers
","
you'll
need
to
use
a
dynamic
SQL
statement
.
In
this
case
","
you'll
also
need
to
worry
about
quoting
the
identifiers
using
PG
if
applicable
","
e.g
.
:
In
the
above
","
the
outer
string
is
delimited
by
$$
","
and
the
inner
strings
are
delimited
by
'
.
After
parameters
get
replaced
","
it'll
look
like
:
And
then
:
And
finally
:
This
particular
statement
of
yours
","
however
","
cannot
be
part
of
a
transaction
so
cannot
go
in
a
do
statement
.
As
such
","
you'll
need
to
resort
to
doing
the

the

the

yes

I
tried

Table

parametrized

As
far

I
know
","
only
column

be
parametrized

Therefore
","
you'll
need
to
string
formatting

Be
sure
that
new_dbname
","
original_dbname
and
owner
do
not
come

I

I
also
use
django-cities

","
I
subclassed

Here
","
I

declare

what

Something

this

Explanation
:
first
I
am
taking
the
all
the
words
in
colA
and
making
a
regular
expression
;
similarly
with
col2
.
Now
with
that
regular
expression
I
am
searching
the
input
file
and
printing
the
result
'
\
b
'
is
word
boundary
.
If
you're
searching
for
a
word
'
cat
'
but
it
may
find
'
catch
'
","
'
\
b
'
is
useful
so
to
find
only
word
'
cat
'
.
I
want
to
extract
certain
information
from
a
large
file
using
python
.
I
have
3
input
files
.
The
first
input
file
(
input_file
)
is
the
data
file
","
which
is
a
3-column
tab-separated
file
that
looks
like
this
:
The
second
input
file
(
colA_file
)
is
a
1-column
list
","
which
looks
like
this
:
The
third
input
file
(
colB_file
)
is
also
a
1-column
list
(
idential
to
colA_file
with
different
information
)
","
which
looks
like
this
:
I
want
to
extract
information
from
the
input
file
that
is
found
in
both
colA
and
colB
.
With
the
example
data
that
I
have
provided
","
this
would
mean
filtering
all
of
the
information
except
for
the
following
lines
:
I
have
written
the
following
code
in
Python
to
solve
this
task
:
However
","
it
only
outputs
1-line
","
as
if
it
is
not
iterating
over
the
list
inputs
provided
.
It
also
seems
that
my
lists
are
being
appended
upon
each
other
","
starting
with
one
item
and
incrementing
itself
with
each
appended
item
.
Thus
","
I
have
also
tried
to
reference
the
lists
as
follows
:
with
the
same
result
as
above
.
I
would
use
pandas
or
numpy
if
you
don't
mind
the
dependency
.
With
a
pandas.DataFrame
you
can
then
perform
isin
checks
on
its
columns
.
Otherwise
I'd
recommend
using
sets
since
regex
should
be
much
slower
.
Something
like
this
:
I'm
trying
to
create
a
n
by
n
array
of
objects
with
NumPy
and
here
are
my
problems
:
Let's
assume
the
dimension
of
the
array
are
set
to
m=n=3
.
To
each
element
of
I
would
like
to
assign
an
instance
of
my
class
Vector
","
which
is
a
n-dimensional
vector
type
.
In
my
first
attempt
I
tried
to
assign
a
2-dim
.
vector
in
the
following
way
:
Instead
of
an
array
of
Vector
instances
Python
returns
:
The
above
is
an
array
of
shape
(
3
","
3
","
2
)
","
not
of
(
2
","
2
)
.
Numpy
converted
the
Vectorinstances
to
a
third
array
dimension
.
This
is
not
what
I
wanted
","
so
I
tried
another
thing
:
I
first
defined
an
empty
object
array
and
then
assigned
the
instances
to
it
:
The
funny
thing
about
it
is
that
I
have
to
cast
the
array
to
a
list
.
Then
it
works
pretty
well
and
returns
exactly
what
I
need
:
It
is
then
possible
to
cast
the
list
back
to
an
array
.
So
","
the
array
can(!)
hold
objects
in
the
way
I
want
it
to
.
But
there
seems
to
be
no
straightforward
way
to
assign
the
instances
.
And
","
isn't
there
a
more
pythonic
to
do
it
?
I
really
want
to
get
rid
of
this
nested
loop
.
I
also
tried
out
np.nditer
:
Instead
of
an
array
","
this
one
returns
an
error
:
ValueError
:
assignment
to
0-d
array
which
I
do
not
understand
.
Does
anybody
have
a
good
solution
concerning
the
nested
loop
?
An
explanation
of
the
value
error
would
also
be
welcome
.
Your
loop
should
work
if
you
don't
cast
to
a
list
","
and
if
you
do
the
assignment
like
:
In
your
first
attempt
","
np.array
is
just
doing
its
job
.
It
sees
a
nested
collection
of
data
that
can
be
converted
to
a
3-D
array
","
so
it
does
so
.
To
get
a
2-D
array
of
objects
","
you
can
change
this
:
to
this
:
Here's
a
concrete
example
:
I
don't
have
your
Vector
class
","
so
I'll
just
use
numpy
arrays
as
the
objects
that
I
want
in
the
array
of
objects
.
Here's
the
data
that
I
want
to
put
into
an
array
of
objects
.
It
is
a
nested
list
of
numpy
arrays
","
each
with
two
elements
:
You
could
change
"np.array([10*j + k, 10*j + k + 1])"
to
"Vector(10*j + k, 10*j + k + 1)"
to
try
this
with
your
Vector
class
.
a
is
the
array
of
objects
that
I'm
creating
:
Assign
the
vectors
to
a
like
this
:
Problem
is
Recursively
calling
the
directory
and
sub
directory
and
pass
it
as
a
string
.
In
line
input_file_list
=
sys.argv
[
1
:
]
I
can
pass
the
argument
as
a
single
directory
but
what
I
want
to
pass
all
the
directory
and
sub
directory
Any
suggestion
will
be
greatly
appreciate

here
it

ran
into
a
similar
problem
.
Here
is
the
code
I
used
to
get
past
the
issue
.
As
user966588
stated
","
the
directory's
timestamp
is
updating
as
the
directory
changes
.
In
the
post
I
linked
","
I
held
onto
any
directory
metadata
updates
until
after
my
directory
was
fully-populated
in
order
for
the
timestamp
change
to
stay
.
Base
to
the
directory
permission
is
this
question
on
SO
.
The
directory
only
changes
its
timestamp
when
the
directory
itself
changes
for
ex
:
when
you
create
a
new
file
in
it
.
So
to
update
the
timestamp
of
folder
you
can
create
a
temp
file
and
then
delete
it
.
There
should
be
a
better
way

till
you
find
it
you
can
manage

this

quick
","
shorthand
plots

series

I
run
into
this
problem
frequently
in
Python's
ggplot
when
working
with
multiple
stock
prices
and
economic
timeseries
.
The
key
to
remember
with
ggplot
is
that
data
is
best
organized
in
long
format
to
avoid
any
issues
.
I
use
a
quick
two
step
process
as
a
workaround
.
First
let's
grab
some
stock
data
:
First
understand
that
ggplot
needs
the
datetime
index
to
be
a
column
in
the
pandas
dataframe
in
order
to
plot
correctly
when
switching
from
wide
to
long
format
.
I
wrote
a
function
to
address
this
particular
point
.
It
simply
creates
a
'
Date
'
column
of
type=datetime
from
the
pandas
series
index
.
From
there
run
the
function
on
the
df
.
Use
the
result
as
the
object
in
pandas
pd.melt
using
the
'
Date
'
as
the
id_vars
.
The
returned
df
is
now
ready
to
be
plotted
using
the
standard
ggplot()
format
.
From
here
you
can
now
plot
your
data
however
you
want
.
A
common
plot
I
use
is
the
following
:
I'm
experimenting
with
pandas
and
non-matplotlib
plotting

Good
suggestions
are
here
.
This
question
regards
yhat's
ggplot
and
I
am
running
into
two
issues
.
Plotting
a
series
in
pandas
is
easy
.
I
don't
see
how
to
do
this
in
the
ggplot
docs
.
Instead
I
end
up
creating
a
dataframe
:
I
would
expect
ggplot
-
-
a
project
that
has
""""
tight
integration
with
pandas
""""
-
-
to
have
a
way
to
plot
a
simple
series
.
Second
issue
is
I
can't
get
stat_smooth()
to
display
when
the
x
axis
is
time
of
day

Seems
like
it
could
be
related
to
this
post
","
but
I
don't
have
the
rep
to
post
there

code

If
your
problems

transitive
relations

i.e.

The

pretty
easy

create
a
dictionary

every
key

be
one

the
elements

every
value
would
be
a
list
of
elements
which
are
at
most
7

For
your

you
would
have
something
like
this
:

would
give
you
something

you
need
to
write
a

will

an

it

it
can
find
an
element
which
is
at
most
7
apart
from
the
current
element
.
Somewhere
in
the
code
you
also
need
to
remember
which
elements
you
have
already
visited
to
make
sure
that
you
don't
get
into
an
infinite
loop
.
You
need
to
call
that
function
for
every
element
in
your
list

code
should
give
the

For

Just
use

expand

Keep
in
mind
if
your

more

two

","
the

fail

actually
you
can
do
what
you
want
","
by
using
a

the
destructuring
array
syntax
is
there
for
you
:
if
you
want
to
get
the
result
as
a
list
you
can
:
if
you
want
to
get
only
one

In
python
","
returning
multiple
variables
corresponds
to
returning
any
iterable
","
so
there's
no
practical
difference
between
returning
a
list
or
""""
multiple
variables
""""
:
The
only
difference
between
these
two
functions
is
that
f
returns
a
tuple
","
and
g
returns
a
list
-
which
is
indifferent
","
if
you
use
multiple
assignment
on
the
return
value
.
I
have
a
complex
variable
like
the
one
below
...
I
have
written
a
function
to
extract
the
variables
from
the
desired
test
","
see
below
...
This
returns
something
like
the
following
...
I
would
like
to
be
able
to
return
the
variables
as
individual
variables
and
not
elements
of
a
list
.
How
would
I
go
about
doing
this
?
How
do
I
return
variable
number

(
sort

I
am
trying
to
write

Even

I
managed

write

is
working
","
there
are
still
a
few
things

make
troubles

I
present

everything
works
well
until
I
don't
press
any

the
wrong

So
my
question
is
","
how
do
I
have
to
write
the

Thanks

I
get
the
error
message
:
My
guess
is
that
you
get
this
error
message
at
the
if
resp
[0]
=
=
correctResp
:
line
:
Is
that
true
?
If
yes
","
it
is
simply
because
event.getKeys()
returns
an
empty
list
[]
if
no
responses
were
collected
.
And
doing
[]
[0]
will
give
you
the
above
error
because
there's
no
first
element
(
index
zero
)
just
like
"[1,2,3,4]"
[1000]
will
give
you
the
same
error
.
Note
that
even
if
you
press
a
lot
of
keys
and
none
of
them
are
in
the
keyList
","
getKeys
will
return
an
empty
list
because
it
ignores
everything
but
the
contents
of
the
keyList
(
unless
you
set
keyList=None
","
in
which
case
it
accepts
all
keys
)
.
There's
a
few
simple
ways
out
of
this
.
Firstly
","
you
can
simply
check
whether
resp
is
empty
and
give
a
""""
fail
""""
score
if
it
is
and
only
check
for
correctness
if
it
is
not
.
A
more
general
solution
","
which
would
work
with
many
response
keys
and
scoring
criteria
","
is
to
do
if
correctResp
in
resp
and
then
score
as
a
success
if
yes
.
This
comparison
will
work
with
an
empty
list
as
well
","
in
which
case
it
always
returns
False
as
empty
lists
per
definition
can't
contain
anything
.
But
in
your
particular
case
","
you
only
have
one
response
option
so
it
is
even
simpler
!
Since
you've
""""
filtered
""""
responses
sing
the
keyList
","
you
KNOW
that
if
resp
is
[]
","
the
subject
answered
""""
no-go
""""
and
conversely
if
resp
is
not
[]
","
he
/
she
answered
""""
go
""""
.
So
:
Actually
","
I
suspect
that
you
also
want
to
give
feedback
in
trials
without
neutral
images
.
In
that
case
","
define
correct
as
bool(resp)
is
(
im
in
im_n
)
:
I
was

Since

You
should
investigate
Java
serialization
To
serialize
an
object
means
to
convert
its
state
to
a
byte
stream
so
that
the
byte
stream
can
be
reverted
back
into
a
copy
of
the
object
.
A
Java
object
is
serializable
if
its
class
or
any
of
its
superclasses
implements
either
the
java.io.Serializable
interface
or
its
subinterface
","
java.io.Externalizable
.
Deserialization
is
the
process
of
converting
the
serialized
form
of
an
object
back
into
a
copy
of
the
object
.
Java
can
serialize
natively
to
a
byte
stream
.
That
bytestream
can
be
a
file
","
a
network
stream
etc.
Additionally
a
number
of
3rd
party
libraries
exist
to
serialise
to
XML
","
JSON
etc.
I
made
this
method
in
Python
:
Now
I
would
like
to
migrate
it
to
a

up

With
minimal
modification
to

iterate
over

not
actual

yield

it
a

allowing
to
return
all
values

Use
it

so
:
can
you
please
tell
me
how
to
get
every
character

a

repeated

the
for
loop

python?my
progress

this
returns
only
the
first
letter

repeated
I
believe
you
want
to
print
each
character

the
input
string
twice
","

order

The
issue
with
your
attempt

your
use

You
only
want

return
the
final
string
","
not
just
a
single
repetition

one
character
from
inside
the

.
So
you
want
your
return
statement
to
be
somehow
outside
the
for-loop
.

this
sounds

out

","
here
is
the
code
sample
:
But
when
I
am

find

Log
the

using
\
n

separate

as
you've
already
considered
","
then
write
a
custom

splits
the

inserts
the
appropriate
whitespace
prefix
for
the
subsequent
lines
and
joins
them
back
together
again
.
I
have
been
using
the
logging
module
in
Python
for
a
while
.
My
doubt
is
not
so
much
a
technical
one
","
but
that
I
am
not
sure
of
the
best
practices
with
the
messages
.
The
issue
is
that
sometimes
an
event
happens
and
I
want
to
dump
information
about
it
in
the
log
","
but
a
lot
of
information
.
I
can
build
a
single
long
string
","
and
use
it
in
an
log.info()
command
.
That
is
alright
","
except
for
the
fact
that
the
result
is
hardly
human-readable
.
Introducing
the
character
'
\
n
'
in
the
string
indeed
breaks
the
message
into
separate
lines
in
the
log
file
","
but
left-justified
","
it
looks
ugly
because
in
the
beginning
of
the
logging
formatter
I
am
writing
the
date
/
time
","
user
","
etc.
On
the
other
hand
I
can
split
the
message
into
different
calls
to
log.info()
","
but
that
makes
it
look
as
if
they
were
different
events
.
EDIT
:
Additional
information
.
If
I
do
different
log
calls
","
it
looks
like
What
is
the
usual
/
best
practice
here

I
think
I
would

device

all
the

I'm
working

a

demo

I
try
to
compare
the
efficiency
between
gevent

Generally
speakingï¼Œthe
gevent
code
should
be
more
efficient

the
thread

But
when
I
use
time
command
to
profile
the
program
","
I
get
the
unusual
"result(my command is time python FILENAME.py 50 1000,the last two parameters means pool number or thread number,so I change the two number in the table below)"
.
The
result
shows
that
the
thread
is
more
efficient
than
the
gevent
code
","
so
I
want
to
know
why
this

gevent
VS

My
code
is
below(The main idea is use thread or gevent to send multi HTTP request)
:

It
seems
that

not
patch
httplib
(
have
a
look
at
http://www.gevent.org/gevent.monkey.html

so
you
are
actually
doing
blocking
requests

you
lose
all
advantages
of
the
asynchronous
framework
.
Although
I'm
not
sure
whether
requests
uses
httplib.
If
that
doesn't
work

have
a
look
at
this

You

The

in
different

To

A
simple

modify
the

the

avoiding
the
need

a
exception
clause

and
keeping
the
code
short

The
other
answers

good
for
the
specific
case
where
you
can
avoid
raising
the
exception
in
the
first
place
.
The
more
general
case
where
the
exception
cannot
be
avoided
can
be
handled
a
lambda
function
as
follows
:
The
key
point
here
is
that
making
it
a
lambda
defers
evaluation
of
the
expression
that
might
raise
an
exception
until
inside
the
try
/
except
block
of
the
test()
function
where
it
can
be
caught
.
test()
returns
either
the
result
of
the
evaluation
","
or
","
if
an
exception
in
exception_list
is
raised

the

comes
from
an
idea

rejected

think
the

you're
looking

I
want
to

But

can
I
resolve

You
can
use

per
my
understanding

your
question

your

not
closing

the

The
red

the
right
top
corner
.
)
By
default
when
you
click
the
close

your
application
should
close

In
your

it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
bind
the
EVT_CLOSE

some

has
no

close

the
code

method
does
nothing

So
","
in

the

I
made
a

normally
the
users

my
method
is
not
being
used

close
the
window
and
the
window
doesn't
get
closed
ultimately

This
is
the
exit-function

How
can
I

what
i
have
to
far
:
What
you're
trying

import an

not

you
can

then
use
it

believe
the

anyone
advise

Another
way
using
look-ahead
assertion
:
Your
inner
re.search

only
evaluted
once
","

the
result
is
passed

one

This
can't
possible
capture
all
the
capital-letters-pairs
","
only
the
first
one
.
This
means
your
approach
cannot
work
","
not
merely
your
understanding
of
groups
.
Furthermore
","
using
groups
is
unnecessary
.
You
need
to
capture
the
capital
letters
using
parenthesis
","
and
reference
it
as
\
1
in
the
substitution
expression
:
\
1
here
means
:
replace
with
the
substring
matched
by
the
first
(
...
)
in
the
regular
expression
.
(
docs

Note
the
leading
r
in
front
of
the
substitution
string
","

make
it
raw
.
I'm
writing
a
Django
view
that
gets
the
latest
blog
posts
of
a
wordpress
system
.
I
tried
in
a
terminal
to
use
ETags
:
I'd
like
to
avoid
requesting
the
feed
for
every
user
of
the
web
app
.
maybe
etag
aren't
the
best
option
?
Once
the
first
user
sees
this
view
","
can
I
store
the
etag
and
use
it
for
all
the
other
users
?
is
there
a
thread
for
every
user
and
therefore
I
can't
share
the
value
of
a
variable
this
way
?
Etag
allows
to
mark
unique
status
of
a
web
resource
","
so
that
you
have
a
chance
to
ask
for
the
resource
expressing
latest
status
you
already
have
.
But
to
have
some
version
already
at
your
client
","
you
have
to
fetch
it
the
first
time
","
so
for
the
first
request
is
use
of
etag
irrelevant
.
See
HTTP
Etag
at
wikipedia
","
it
explains
it
all
.
Typical
scenario
is
:
fetch
your
page
the
first
time
and
read
value
of
Etag
header
for
future
use
next
time
you
ask
for
the
same
page
","
you
add
header
If-None-Match
with
value
of
Etag
from
your
last
fetch
.
Server
will
check
","
if
there
is
something
new
","
if
the
Etag
you
provide
and
Etag
at
current
version
of
resource
are
the
same
","
it
will
not
return
complete
page
back
","
but
rather
returh
HTTP
Status
code
304
Not
Modified
.
If
the
page
has
different
status
on
the
server
","
you
get
the
page
with
HTTP
Status
code
200
and
with
new
value
of
Etag
in
the
response
header
.
If
you
want
to
optimize
your
app
not
to
generate
initial
request
for
the
same
feed
by
each
user
","
you
shall
somehow
share
the
Etag
value
for
given
resource
globally
across
your
application
.
The
first
request
the
client
will
never
be
able
to
use
any
local
caches
","
so
at
the
first
request
ETag
isn't
necessary
.
Remember
that
ETag
needs
to
be
passed
into
the
conditional
request
headers
(
If-None-Match
","
If-Match
","
etc
)
","
the
semantic
of
non
conditional
requests
are
clear
.
If
your
feed
is
a
public
feed
","
then
an
intermediate
caching
proxy
are
also
allowed
to
return
an
ETagged
result
for
non
conditional
request
","
although
it
will
always
have
to
contact
origin
server

the
conditional
header
doesn't
match

use

save

directly
","
rather

setting

individually
:
Finally
","
you
should
not
be
extending

model
","
but
you
should
extend

set
the
AUTH_MODEL
setting

point
to

then
request.user
will
be
an
instance

You
initialize

way
you
know

from

I
believe
the

the
same
thing
for
both
ways

this
may
clean
up

carefully

A
solution

your
situation

to
put
all
executable
scripts
in

I.e

move

I
want
to
revisit
the
question
as
specified
in
PYTHONPATH
vs
.
sys.path
.
Basically
it
is
concerned
with
developing
a
package
like
:
Assuming
script.py
does
from
package.lib
import foo
it
does
work

calling

printing
sys.path
first
entry
is

","
but
in
second
case
the
first
entry
is
the
absolute
path
to
where
script.py
is
sitting
.
And
of
course
in
that
case
it
does
not
know
anything
about
package
and
the
import fails
.
This
will
also
be
the
case
when
double-clicking
in

.
The
original
stackoverflow
question
recommends

not

Can
anyone

out

the

their

It's
a
very
powerful
unit

Lastly
you
can
just
create
a
boring
dummy
class

For
test
purposes
I
need
to
create
something

an
empty

some
particular

Let
me
clarify
by
example
:
Currently
there
is
a
structure
:
The
thing
I
want
is
for
'
this_has_to_be_object
'
to
be
an
actual
object
to
which
I
can
add
some
fields
and
set
values
.
The
objective
of
such
behaviour
is
to
test
another
function
that
operates
with
'
this_has_to_be_object'.field
.
So
:
Im
trying
to
create
a
sql
table
:
I
want
to
give
an
id
to
every
movie
title
and
rating
and
the
create
a
tabel
with
3
fields
Â
¨
My
code
so
fare
is
:
My
list
look
like
this
:
How
can
i
get
this
into
a
SQL
db
?
Update
:
Output
:
If
you
don't
want
to
insert
movie
id
manually
","
change
creating
your
imdb
table
definition
with
:
"c.execute('''CREATE TABLE imdb (mov_id ROWID, Title, Rating)"
'
'
'
)
which
lets
you
omit
specifying
mov_id
in
your
insert
.
Then
","
just
add
your
record
using
just
instead
of
your
#
Insert
a
row
of
data
line
.
BTW
:
I'd
personally
do
rstrip()
on
your
Title
to
remove
newline
character
","
if
you
don't
need
it

it
should
here

work

If
you
make
the

a
real
browser

__EVENTTARGET

","
since
Scrapy
cannot
handle

__EVENTTARGET
is
sent

an
empty

it
is
actually
set

I'm
using
Scrapy
to
scrape
some
gold
that's
behind
an
authentication
screen
.
The
website
uses
ASP.net
and
ASP's
got
some
stupid
hidden
fields
littered
all
over
the
form
(
like
__VIEWSTATE
","
__EVENTTARGET
)
.
When
I
call
FormRequest.from_response(response
","
...
I'm
expecting
that
it
reads
these
hidden
fields
automatically
from
the
response
and
populates
them
in
the
formdata
dictionary
-
which
is
what
Scrapy's
FormRequest
documentation
says
it
should
do
.
But
if
that's
the
case
","
then
why
does
the
login
process
only
work
when
I
explicitly
list
these
fields
and
populate
them
?

:
Adding

using
a
global
variable

is
manipulated

both
events

But
the
loop
doesn't
seem
to
register
the
change
in
the
global
variable

Is
there
anyway
to
make
this
method
work

another

be
more
suitable

Don't
use
globals
.
This
should
technically
work
","
but
it's
bad
practice
and
in
this
case
there's
no
downside
to
simply
adding
a
variable
to
your
class
.
NotNone
has
this
very
moment
posted
an
example
of
how
to
do
so
with
a
kivy
property
","
which
adds
some
other
behaviour
you
may
find
convenient
later
.
2
)
Your
move
function
isn't
compatible
with
an
eventloop
driven
gui
like
kivy
(
or
many
other
gui
libraries
)
.
The
problem
is
that
the
while
function
is
a
blocking
call
-
all
of
kivy's
normal
tasks
can't
be
performed
until
the
move
function
terminates
.
Detecting
and
propagating
touch
is
one
of
these
things
","
so
on_touch_up
will
never
be
called
","
and
the
touched_down
variable
will
never
become
False
.
You
probably
instead
want
to
do
something
like
:
Using
the
clock
like
this
inserts
the
movement
into
the
normal
kivy
eventloop
","
so
it's
called
every
frame
without
blocking
everything
else
.
It
might
also
be
more
natural
to
have
an
update
function
that
is
always
scheduled
(
and
does
other
things
too
)
","
and
use
a
self.touched_down
attribute
as
above
to
optionally
perform
movement
during
that
function
.
I
think
using
a
custom
property
could
solve
your
problem
.
I
am
not
able
to
test
this
","
but
something
like
this
should
work
.
In
my
opinion
properties
are
some
of
the
very
best
features
of
Kivy
","
so
take
a
look
at
them
if
they
aren't
familiar
.
I
have
a
data
set
for
clusters
.
And
the
output
seems
something
like
this
:
-
1
"[1,2]"
2
"[1,6]"
1
"[2,4]"
Where
1
","
2
...
is
the
cluster
id
and
"[1,2]"
.
.
so
on
are
the
points
.
So
i
want
to
plot
the
points
x
co-ordinate
and
y
co-ordinate
on
both
the
axis
and
corresponding
to
that
a
point
in
graph
depicting
the
cluster
id
as
label
and
for
different
id
the
color
of
points
should
be
different
.
How
do
i
go
about
it
?
Thanks
If
one
axis
is
the
cluster
id
I
don't
get
how
you
fit
both
the
x
and
y
coordinates
onto
the
other
axis
.
So
I
plotted
the
x
","
y
on
the
x
and
y
axis
and
used
the
cluster
id
as
a
label
;
you
can
swap
which
value
goes
into
which
axis
","
I
guess
:
N.b
.
:
if
you
have
a
lot
of
data
","
don't
call
scatter
for
each
point
separately
;
append
x
","
y
","
cluster
to
three
separate
lists
and
scatter
the
lists
.
My
Python
code
is
:
Is
it
possible
to
show
the
labels
""""
Jan
""""
","
""""

the

overlapping

you

you
mentioned

I

This
error
is
raised
because
a
set
can
only
contain
immutable
types
.
Or
sets
are
mutable
.
However
there
is
the
frozenset
type
:
The
individual
items
that
you

be
mutable

because
if
they
changed
","
the
effective
hash
would
change
and
thus
the
ability
to
check
for
inclusion
would
break
down
.
Instead
","
you
need
to
put
immutable
objects
into
a
set
-
e.g
.
frozensets
.
If
you
change
the
return
statement
from
your
enum
method
to
...
...
then
it
should
work
.
I
am
wondering
why
for
the
code
shown
below
results
in
passing
self
to
function
?
The
call
is
:
Resulting
in
:
TypeError
:
function()
takes
exactly
1
argument
(
2
given
)
It
appears
that
somewhere
is
a
class
called
ObjT
with
a
method
called
function
that
is
not
designed
to
accept
an
argument
.
I
suspect
the
definition
of
ObjT
includes
this
line
:
Where
it
should
be
something
like
this
:
I
am
building
a
small
micro-web
application
using
bottle
.
First
step
is
that
the
user
inputs
an
ID
into
a
form
in
order
to
retrieve
a
record
.
Once
the
ID
has
been
verified
as
part
of
the
SQLite
database
further
steps
will
be
taken
","
they
can
modify
records
","
add
data
to
another
.
db
with
the
same
PRIMARY
KEY
and
so
on
and
so
forth
.
My
question
is
","
within
the
session
how
do
I
preserve
the
ID
once
verified
and
pass
it
around
the
various
functions
.
Should
it
be
a
global
created
inside
the
function
that
verifies
the
user
input
?
I
am
wary
of
globals
","
just
because
so
much
junk
is
talked
about
them
.
Also
","
I
am
nervous
that
if
not
very
well
managed
the
user
could
restart
the
session
enter
new
data
but
the
global
ID
variable
might
not
have
been
properly
disposed
of
etc....
What
is
the
correct
way
to
approach
this
?
Im
not
sure
it
helps
","
but
here
is
the
code
I
am
using
so
far
....
If
you
want
to
use
the
id
for
a
single
request
then
passing
around
the
local
variable
as
you
seem
to
be
doing
is
better
than
using
globals
.
If
you
want
to
preserve
the
id
across
requests
you
can
save
the
value
in
cookies(if safety of id is not a concern)
and
access
it
then
easily
.
The
cookie's
are
saved
on
the
user's
computer
and
are
accessible
only
during
the
request
.
For
more
on
using
cookies
in
bottle
refer
bottle's
documentation(it is explained in the tutorial)
.
Also
:
instead
of
embedding
the
html
in
your
code
use
templates
!
It
will
make
your
code
neater
.
I
have
Titan
(
with
embedded
cassandra
running
on
my
system
)
.
I
have
rexster
server
running
I
am
able
to
create
a
graph
from
the
rexter
shell
using
Gremlin
queries
.
I
have
installed
bulbs
on
my
system
as
follows
.
If
I
try
the
following
from
ipython
on
my
machine
I
get
the
following
error
.
What
does
these
mean
?
Titan
has
its
own
module
...
I
have
list
which
is
already
sorted
.
I
often
need
to
check
to
see
Is
there
a
way
to
teach
'
in
'
that
sortedlist
is
sorted
and
that
it
should
binary
search
the
list
?
Python
favours
explicit
over
implicit
.
Your
options
are
to
explicitly
use
the
bisect
module
if
you
know
your
data
is
sorted
","
or
create
a
subclass
of
list
that
implements
__contains__
by
using
that
module
.
For
example
:
could
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
list
","
and
in
will
use
__contains__
automatically
.
You'd
probably
want
to
override
__setitem__
","
.
extend()
and
.
append()
to
maintain
the
list
in
sorted
order
","
too
.
My
suggestion
would
be
to
subclass
list
to
use
sorted
list
:
Then
:
You
are
using

an
AI

You
appear
to
have
a
sequence
of
Individual
instances
;
you'd
look
up
the
documentation
and
see
what
attributes
such
instances
have
.
You
are
looking
at
the
string
representation

these

","
but
you
should
be
able

access

states
there
are

maximize

try
these

see
which

A
quick
peek

Or
does
'
honda

need

.
If
not
","
is
there
a
way

","

say
","
one
form
.
Can
I
make
calls
on
'
civic
'
for
things
pertaining
to
the
manufacture
?
For
example
","
could
I
get
the
'
company_created
'
data
from
the
civic
instance
?
If
not
","
why
bother
having
the
relationship
in
the
first
place
?
Thanks
so
much
in
advance
.
I
would
really
appreciate
a
thorough
answer
so
I
can
understand
models
and
relationships
fully
.
And
yes
","
I
have
read
the
docs
.
Firstly
","
the
thing
to
remember
is
that
these
classes
are
representations
of
underlying
database
tables
.
A
ForeignKey
field
in
a
Django
model
represents
a
one-to-many
relationship
in
the
database
","
with
an
_id
field
representing
the
ID
of
another
table
.
Those
tables
are
themselves
independent
","
but
are
linked
via
the
FK
field
(
and
the
relevant
index
constraint
","
if
the
database
supports
them
)
.
That
said
","
in
your
Car
model
manufacturer
is
a
required
field
(
because
you
haven't
defined
it
as
null=True
)
.
So
when
you
create
a
Car
","
you
must
point
it
at
an
already
existing
Manufacturer
-
and
that
manufacturer
must
have
been
saved
already
","
so
that
Django
can
populate
the
underlying
manufacturer_id
field
with
the
ID
of
the
related
object
Because
Django
is
aware
of
the
foreign
key
relationship
between
the
two
objects
","
you
can
use
them
when
querying
.
In
SQL
this
would
be
done
via
JOINs
:
Django
gives
you
a
special
syntax
to
do
queries
across
those
joins
","
via
double
underscores
.
So
","
for
example
","
if
you
wanted
to
get
all
the
cars
made
by
a
manufacturer
created
in
1990
(
assuming
that's
what
you
mean
by
the
company_created
field
)
","
you
would
do
this
:
Django
translates
this
into
something
like
""""
:
If
you
already
have
your
""""
civic
""""
instance
and
just
want
to
get
access
to
the
related
data
","
this
is
pure
Python
object
access
:
civic.manufacturer
is
the
related
Manufacturer
object
","
so
you
can
simply
do
civic.manufacturer.company_created
to
get
the
relevant
data
.
Again
","
Django
translates
that
into
the
database
access
","
but
from
your
point
of
view
this
is
simple
object
composition
.
Note
that
really
all
this
is
fully
explained
in
the
tutorial
","
with
relationships
between
Poll
and
Choice
which
exactly
match
your
Manufacturer
and
Car
models
.
I
have
been
writing
a
proof-of-concept
type
program
that
sends
a
screenshot
over
the
network
","
and
for
some
reason
","
the
dataRecieved
method
isn't
being
called
after
data
is
sent
.
Here
is
my
code
SERVER
CLIENT
When
you
call
reactor.stop
at
the
end
of
connectionMade
","
you
immediately
shut
down
the
whole
process
before
any
data
is
sent
.
Remove
it
and
you
should
be
fine
.
How
can
i
get
[
1
","
2
","
3
","
4
","
""""
hello
""""
]
with
list
comprehension
in
python
?
You'd
use
a
conditional
expression
instead
:
This
is
part
of
the
left-hand
element-producing
expression
","
not
the
list
comprehension
syntax
itself
","
where
if
statements
act
as
a
filter
.
The
conditional
expression
uses
the
form
true_expression
if
test_expression
else
false_expression
;
it
always
produces
a
value
.
I
simplified
the
expression
a
little
;
if
you
are
replacing
""""
-
-
""""
with
""""
hello
""""
you
may
as
well
just
return
""""
hello
""""
.
[
"cell.replace(""--"",""hello"")"
if
cell
=
=
""""
-
-
""""
else
cell
for
cell
in
row
]
When
using
the
if
at
the
end
of
the
for
","
it
restricts
which
items
are
considered
","
so
that
version
will
only
return
one
item
","
since
only
one
item
in
the
source
list
matches
the
condition
.
Also
in
this
case
you
don't
need
to
use
replace
","
you
could
just
use
""""
hello
""""
if
cell
=
=
""""
-
-
""""
instead
","
but
you
would
use
this
form
if
you
had
multiple
items
you
wanted
to
manipulate
.
I
have
my
webapp
written

localhost

My
script
needs
to
read
text
files
located
in
various
directories
.
So
in
my
Python
script
I
would
simply
use
"os.chdir(""./""+subdirectory_name)"
and
then
start
opening
and
reading
the
files
and
using
the
text
for
analysis

I
cannot
do
that
when
trying
to
move
it
over
to
App
Engine

I
assume
I
need
to
make
some
sort
of
changes
to

that

anyone

me

You

need
to
change
your
working
directory
at
all
to
read
files

Use
absolute
paths
instead

Use
the
current
file
location
as
the
starting
point
","
and
resolve
all
relative
paths
from
there

you

upload
them

You
can
package

will
later
be
connected

here

a
simpler
variant

Linux

GDB
debugger

its
python

want

debug
a
C

the

basic
questions
.
How
to
install
my
pretty
printer
in
python
under
GDB
?
(
I'm
seeing
several
ways
in
the
documentation
","
and
I
can't
choose
the
appropriate
one
)
.
How
to
ensure
that
GDB
pretty-prints
both
union
my_un
and
its
typedef-ed
synonym
myval_t
the
same
way
.
How
should
the
pretty
printer
detect
NULL
pointers
?
How
can
my
pretty
printer
recurse
for
struct
boxsequence_st
?
This
means
detecting
that
the
pointer
is
non-nil
","
then
dereferencing
its
ptag
","
comparing
that
tag
to
tag_sequence
","
pretty
printing
the
valtab
flexible
array
member
.
How
to
avoid
recursing
too
deeply
the
pretty
printing
?
I
don't
have
enough
experience
with
the
gdb
Python
api
to
call
this
an
answer
;
I
consider
this
just
some
research
notes
from
a
fellow
developer
.
My
code
attached
below
is
quite
crude
and
ugly
","
too
.
However
","
this
does
work
with
gdb-7.4
and
python-2.7.3
.
An
example
debugging
run
:
All
of
the
above
are
bog-standard
pretty-printed
outputs
-
-
my
reasoning
is
that
I
often
want
to
see
what
the
pointers
are
","
so
I
didn't
want
to
override
those
.
However
","
dreferencing
the
pointers
uses
the
prettyprinter
shown
further
below
:
The
last
line
shows
that
when
debugging
tiny
","
tiny-gdb.py
in
the
same
directory
gets
loaded
automatically
(
although
you
can
disable
this
","
I
do
believe
this
is
the
default
behaviour
)
.
The
tiny-gdb.py
file
used
for
above
:
The
reasoning
behind
my
choices
are
as
follows
:
How
to
install
pretty-printers
to
gdb
?
There
are
two
parts
to
this
question
:
where
to
install
the
Python
files
","
and
how
to
hook
the
pretty-printers
to
gdb
.
Because
the
pretty-printer
selection
cannot
rely
on
the
inferred
type
alone
","
but
has
to
peek
into
the
actual
data
fields
","
you
cannot
use
the
regular
expression
matching
functions
.
Instead
","
I
chose
to
add
my
own
pretty-printer
selector
function
","
typefilter()
","
to
the
global
pretty-printers
list
","
as
described
in
the
documentation
.
I
did
not
implement
the
enable
/
disable
functionality
","
because
I
believe
it
is
easier
to
just
load
/
not
load
the
relevant
Python
script
instead
.
(
typefilter()
gets
called
once
per
every
variable
reference
","
unless
some
other
pretty-printer
has
already
accepted
it
.
)
The
file
location
issue
is
a
more
complicated
one
.
For
application-specific
pretty-printers
","
putting
them
into
a
single
Python
script
file
sounds
sensible
","
but
for
a
library
","
some
splitting
seems
to
be
in
order
.
The
documentation
recommends
packaging
the
functions
into
a
Python
module
","
so
that
a
simple
python
import module
enables
the
pretty-printer
.
Fortunately
","
Python
packaging
is
quite
straightforward
.
If
you
were
to
import gdb
to
the
top
and
save
it
to
/
usr
/
lib
/
pythonX.Y
/
tiny.py
","
where
X.Y
is
the
python
version
used
","
you
only
need
to
run
python
import tiny
in
gdb
to
enable
the
pretty-printer
.
Of
course
","
properly
packaging
the
pretty-printer
is
a
very
good
idea
","
especially
if
you
intend
to
distribute
it
","
but
it
does
pretty
much
boil
down
to
adding
some
variables
et
cetera
to
the
beginning
of
the
script
","
assuming
you
keep
it
as
a
single
file
.
For
more
complex
pretty-printers
","
using
a
directory
layout
might
be
a
good
idea
.
If
you
have
a
value
val
","
then
val.type
is
the
gdb.Type
object
describing
its
type
;
converting
it
to
string
yields
a
human-readable
type
name
.
val.type.strip_typedefs()
yields
the
actual
type
with
all
typedefs
stripped
.
I
even
added
.
unqualified()
","
so
that
all
const
/
volatile
/
etc.
type
qualifiers
are
removed
.
NULL
pointer
detection
is
a
bit
tricky
.
The
best
way
I
found
","
was
to
examine
the
stringified
.
address
member
of
the
target
gdb.Value
object
","
and
see
if
it
is
""""
0x0
""""
.
To
make
life
easier
","
I
was
able
to
write
a
simple
deref()
function
","
which
tries
to
dereference
a
pointer
.
If
the
target
points
to
(
void
*
)
0
","
it
returns
the
string
""""
NULL
""""
","
otherwise
it
returns
the
target
gdb.Value
object
.
The
way
I
use
deref()
is
based
on
the
fact
that
""""
array
""""
type
pretty-printers
yield
a
list
of
2-tuples
","
where
the
first
item
is
the
name
string
","
and
the
second
item
is
either
a
gdb.Value
object
","
or
a
string
.
This
list
is
returned
by
the
children()
method
of
the
pretty-printer
object
.
Handling
""""
discriminated
union
""""
types
would
be
much
easier
","
if
you
had
a
separate
type
for
the
generic
entity
.
That
is
","
if
you
had
and
it
was
used
everywhere
when
the
tag
value
is
still
uncertain
;
and
the
specific
structure
types
only
used
where
their
tag
value
is
fixed
.
This
would
allow
a
much
simpler
type
inference
.
As
it
is
","
in
tiny.c
the
struct
box*_st
types
can
be
used
interchangeably
.
(
Or
","
more
specifically
","
we
cannot
rely
on
a
specific
tag
value
based
on
the
type
alone
.
)
The
sequence
case
is
actually
quite
simple
","
because
valtab
[]
can
be
treated
as
simply
as
an
array
of
void
pointers
.
The
sequence
tag
is
used
to
pick
the
correct
union
member
.
In
fact
","
if
valtab
[]
was
simply
a
void
pointer
array
","
then
gdb.Value.cast(gdb.lookup_type()
)
or
gdb.Value.reinterpret_cast(gdb.lookup_type()
)
can
be
used
to
change
each
pointer
type
as
necessary
","
just
like
I
do
for
the
boxed
structure
types
.
Recursion
limits
?
You
can
use
the
@
operator
in
print
command
to
specify
how
many
elements
are
printed
","
but
that
does
not
help
with
nesting
.
If
you
add
iseq3->valtab
[2]
=
(
myval_t)iseq3
;
to
tiny.c
","
you
get
an
infinitely
recursive
sequence
.
gdb
does
print
it
nicely
","
especially
with
set
print
array
","
but
it
does
not
notice
or
care
about
the
recursion
.
In
my
opinion
","
you
might
wish
to
write
a
gdb
command
in
addition
to
a
pretty-printer
for
deeply
nested
or
recursive
data
structures
.
During
my
testing
","
I
wrote
a
command
that
uses
Graphviz
to
draw
binary
tree
structures
directly
from
within
gdb
;
I'm
absolutely
convinced
it
beats
plain
text
output
.

Graphviz

you
can
use

Because

visited

a
Python
set

","
it

not

I
probably
should
have
cleaned
my
Python

of
the
function
:
Notice
the
two
places
where
the
control
flow
goes
to
next
i
.
There
is
no
good
way
to
write
that
in
Python
.
One
choice
uses
an
extra
boolean
variable
that
can
be
set
and
tested
to
determine
when
to
bypass
the
rest
of
the
code
.
The
other
choice
","
which
I
took
above
","
is
to
write
a
local
function
to
perform
the
task
.
This
""""
loop-and-a-half
""""
idiom
is
convenient
and
useful
;
it
was
proposed
in
PEP
3136
and
rejected
by
Guido
.
To
remove
the
recursion
","
you
need
to
make
your
functions
iterative
.
For
add
to
list
","
this
is
easy
.
Something
like
this
should
work
.
For
maxMatching
","
this
is
also
possible
","
but
it
takes
some
more
work
.
However
","
do
you
notice
that
your
recursion
builds
the
dp
table
from
top
left
to
bottom
right
?
And
that
you
use
the
values
of
the
dp
to
calculate
the
value
maxMatching
more
to
the
right
and
to
the
bottom
?
So
what
you
can
do
is
to
create
a
helper
table
(
like
dp
and
boolean
)
and
construct
that
from
top
to
bottom
and
left
to
right
.
For
each
of
the
cells
you
calculate
the
value
based
on
the
values
as
you
would
now
","
but
instead
of
using
recursion
","
you
use
the
value
from
the
helper
table
.
This
method
is
called
Dynamic
Programming
","
which
is
building
a
solution
based
on
the
solutions
of
smaller
problems
.
Many
problems
that
can
be
defined
using
some
form
of
mathematical
resursion
can
be
solved
using
Dynamic
Programming
.
See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming
for
more
examples
.
I
am
having
a
problem
with
'
Maximum
recursion
depth
exceeded
'
in
python
I
converted
a
java(I dont know java so it wasn't easy)
function
to
python
function
and
it
did
work
for
small
lists
but
when
I
use
large
lists
I
get
that
error
.
I
tried
to
do
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)
but
it
seem
that
there
is
a
problem
because
it
will
not
finish
","
maybe
because
I
converted
the
java
code
to
python
in
a
wrong
way
.
this
is
the
python
code
of
the
function
the
function
should
return
a
list
from
list
b
which
are
the
nearest
points
from
list
a
I
thought
that
convert
this
function
to
iterative
will
resolve
the
problem
.
my
question
is
","
how
to
make
that
function
100
%
iterative
instead
of
recursive
?
thanks
You
can
utilise
itertools.cycle
to
repeat
one
of
the
iterables
","
eg
:
Note
that
while
cycle
will
repeat
its
elements
indefinitely
","
izip
stops
on
the
shortest
iterable
(
list1
)
.
EDIT
Okay
","
that
makes
more
sense
-
How
about
this
...
Though
I
feel
the
same
as
you
-
there
is
probably
a
smoother
way
to
accomplish
that
...
I've
got
a
script
running
that
I
want
to
toggle
between
different
variables
.
Let's
say
I've
got
a
list
of
urls
and
I
want
to
concatenate
one
of
the
variables
a
","
b
or
c
.
I
don't
care
which
but
I'd
expect
the
variables
to
repeat
but
the
list
would
run
through
once
.
v
would
end
up
looking
like
url1+string1
url2+string2
url3+string3
url4+string1
url5+string2
etc
I
was
able
to
get
this
to
work
on
my
own
but
I'm
new
and
learning
","
does
anyone
have
a
more
elegant
solution
to
this
?
it
returns
what
I
was
looking
for
but
it's
messy
:
string1a
string2b
string3c
string4a
string5b
string6c
string7a
string8b

whl
-
it
seems
your
pip
is
old
and
doesn't
support
wheels
.
Try
updating
pip
first
.
I
do
not
think
it
is
the
language
data
structure
type
that
should
be
differentiated
","
but
it
is
more
about
the
data
you
send
over
.
Note
that
","
different
languages
may
have
different
language
structures
and
so
on
.
That
is
just
really
low-level
details
.
What
is
more
important
is
what
you
send
.
You
could
look
into
the
following
example
how
the
serialization
/
deserialization
works
with
json
format
in
QtCore
.
Json
is
also
supported
in
python
quite
well
by
the
json
module
","
so
you
would
have
no
issue
on
the
server
side
to
deserialize
it
:
JSON
Save
Game
Example
This
is
basically
the
important
part
that
would
give
you
some
hint
on
the
client
side
.
Do
not
get
lost
at
saving
into
a
file
.
It
is
basically
writing
the
raw
bytes
to
the
file
","
which
you
would
replace
by
sending
over
the
network
:
...
and
then
you
would
do
something
like
this
on
the
server
side
","
again
instead
of
reading
from
file
","
you
would
read
from
the
network
","
but
that
is
not
a
biggie
as
both
are
IO
.
You
could
use
raw
protocol
to
design
your
own
","
or
just
use
an
extending
.
I
would
suggest
to
go
with
something
standard
","
like
http
(
tcp
/
udp
)
.
Then
","
you
would
only
need
to
define
the
json
format
for
your
own
data
","
and
not
deal
with
all
the
rest
","
like
one-way
or
two-way
communication
","
transaction
identifier
against
reply
attack
","
timestamp
","
data
size
and
so
on
.
This
would
allow
you
to
truly
concentrate
on
the
important
stuff
for
you
.
Once
","
you
have
your
own
json
format
defined
","
you
could
look
into
the
QtNetwork
module
to
send
post
","
get
","
put
and
delete
requests
as
you
wish
.
You
would
probably
work
closely
with
the
QNetworkManager
","
QNetworkReply
classes
","
and
so
on
.
Here
you
can
find
a
simple
client
implementation
in
Qt
with
QtCore's
json
for
a
simple
pastebin
functionality
:
The
JSON
is
defined
in
here
:
http://sayakb.github.io/sticky-notes/pages/api/
For
sure
","
it
is
not
the
only
way
of
doing
it
","
e.g
.
if
you
need
efficiency
","
you
may
well
look
into
a
binary
format
like
capnproto
.

begginer
in

programming
","
so
","
sorry
if
my
questions
may
appear
a
little
obvious
.
I'm
trying
to
send
some
data
from
Qt
application
to
a
Python
server
which
will
process
them
and
send
back
some
answer
.
the
methods
that
allows
me
to
send
data
in
the
QTcpSocket
class
are
:
my
application
will
manage

authentification
","
sending
and
receiving
some
complexe
data
like
struct
","
and
files
.
I've
many
questions
about
this
situation
:
Are
the
methods
mentioned
above
sufficient
to
send
complexe
data
","
and
how
?
how
to
deal
with
the
data
types
in
the
server
side

with
Python
)
?
do
you
think
I
should
use
an
other
protocole
like
HTTP
(
with
the
QNetworkAccessManager

Trying
to
answer
your
questions
:
Are
the
methods
mentioned
above
sufficient
to
send
complexe
data
","
and
how
?
Well
","
yes
","
sending
a
raw
byte
array
is
the
lowest
level
format
.
However
","
you
need
a
something
that
can
get
you
uniquely
from
your
complex
data
to
the
byte
array
and
from
the
byte
array
back
to
your
complex
data
.
This
process
is
called
in
different
ways
","
encoding
","
serializing
","
marshalling
....
But
in
general
it
just
means
creating
a
system
for
encoding
complex
structures
into
a
sequence
of
bytes
or
characters
There
are
many
you
can
choose
from
:
ASN.1
","
JSON
","
XML
","
Google's
protocol
buffers
or
MIME
....
You
can
even
design
your
own
(
e.g
.
a
simple
schema
is
using
TLV
:
(
Tag-Length-Value
)
","
where
Tag
is
an
identifier
of
the
Type
and
Value
can
be
a
basic
type
[
and
you
have
to
define
a
representation
for
each
type
that
you
consider
basic
]
or
again
one
or
more
TLV
)
","
Length
indicates
how
many
bytes
/
characters
are
used
to
encode
the
Value
.
What
to
choose
depends
a
lot
of
where
you
encode
(
language
/
platform
)
and
where
you
decode
(
language
/
platform
)
and
your
requirements
for
speed
","
bandwidth
usage
","
transport
","
whether
messages
should
be
inspected
...
etc.
If
you're
dealing
with
heterogenous
architectures
you
might
need
to
think
about
endianness
.
Finally
","
you
should
distinguish
between
the
format
(
i.e.
how
the
complex
structure
is
expressed
as
a
sequence
of
bytes
in
the
line
)
and
the
library
used
for
encoding
(
or
the
library
used
for
decoding
)
.
Sometimes
they
will
be
linked
","
sometimes
for
the
same
format
you
will
have
a
choice
of
libraries
to
use
.
how
to
deal
with
the
data
types
in
the
server
side
(
with
Python
)
?
So
","
here
you
have
a
requirement
...
if
you're
going
for
a
externally
provided
format
","
you
must
make
sure
it
has
a
python
library
able
to
decode
it
.
if
you're
going
for
a
home-grown
solution
","
one
of
things
you
should
define
is
the
expression
of
your
complex
C
+
+
structures
as
Python
structures
.
An
additional
possibility
is
to
do
everything
in
C
+
+
","
and
for
the
python
server
side
use
one
of
the
systems
for
creating
python
extensions
in
C
+
+
(
e.g
.
boost-python
or
swig
....
)
do
you
think
I
should
use
an
other
protocol
like
HTTP
(
with
the
QNetworkAccessManager
class
)
?
It
depends
on
what
you
try
to
do
.
There
are
many
HTTP
libraries
widely
available
that
you
can
use
on
different
languages
and
different
architectures
.
You
still
need
to
solve
the
problem
of
deciding
the
formatting
of
your
information
(
although
HTTP
have
some
defined
practices
)
.
In
addition
HTTP
is
clearly
biased
towards
the
communication
of
a
client
with
a
server
","
with
the
action
always
initiated
by
the
client
.
Things
get
complex
(
or
less
widely
supported
)
when
is
the
server
the
one
that
needs
to
initiate
the
communication
or
the
one
that
needs
to
send
spontaneous
information

With
Scrapy

I

get
data
data
from
backend
through
ajax
in
django
.
But
i
am
getting
error
over
there

It
directly
going
to
the
error
function
of
ajax

But
in

data
is
getting
printed

help
me
out
when

am
getting
the
data
in
view
.
Data
is
not
getting
passed
to
the
ajax
success
function

I
think
you
should
use
instead
of
uninitialized
data
variable
in
your
javascript
code
.
I'm
trying
to
solve
a
second
order
ODE
using
odeint
from

.
The
issue
I'm
having
is
the
function
is
implicitly
coupled
to
the
second
order
term
","
as
seen
in
the
simplified
snippet
(
please
ignore
the
pretend
physics
of
the
example
)
:
in
this
case
I
realise
it
is
possible
to
algebraically
solve
for
the
implicit
variable
","
however
in
my
actual
scenario
there
is
a
lot
of
logic
between
F_r
and
the
evaluation
of
a
and
algebraic
manipulation
fails
.
I
believe
the
DAE
could
be
solved
using
MATLAB's
ode15i
function
","
but
I'm
trying
to
avoid
that
scenario
if
at
all
possible
.
My
question
is
-
is
there
a
way
to
solve
implicit
ODE
functions
(
DAE
)
in
python( scipy preferably)
?
And
is
there
a
better
way
to
pose
the
problem
above
to
do
so
?
As
a
last
resort
","
it
may
be
acceptable
to
pass
a
from
the
previous
time-step
.
How
could
I
pass
dydt
[1]
back
into
the
function
after
each
time-step
?
if
algebraic
manipulation
fails
","
you
can
go
for
a
numerical
solution
of
your
constraint
","
running
for
example
fsolve
at
each
timestep
:
Clearly
this
will
slow
down
your
time
integration
.
Always
check
that
fsolve
finds
a
good
solution
","
and
flush
the
output
so
that
you
can
realize
it
as
it
happens
and
stop
the
simulation
.
About
how
to
""""
cache
""""
the
value
of
a
variable
at
a
previous
timestep
","
you
can
exploit
the
fact
that
default
arguments
are
calculated
only
at
the
function
definition
","
Notice
that
in
order
for
the
trick
to
work
the
cache
parameter
must
be
mutable
","
and
that's
why
I
use
a
list
.
See
this
link
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
how
default
arguments
work
.
Notice
that
the
two
codes
DO
NOT
produce
the
same
result
","
and
you
should
be
very
careful
using
the
value
at
the
previous
timestep
","
both
for
numerical
stability
and
precision
.
The
second
is
clearly
much
faster
though
.
I'm
saving
date
in
UTC
.
I
wan't
to
change
that
date
to
automatic
user
timezone
.

correctly
.
Please
suggest
a
good
way
to
solve
this
issue
.
I
got
a

I
want
to
make
a
cluster
style
dendrogram
in
bokeh

I
like
this
bokeh
dot
plot
example

but
i
want
to
make
lines
curvy
and
show
a
cluster

like
this

Any
suggestion
on
how
to
make
lines
curvy
and
show
the
clustering
relation
like
in
dendrogram
.
This
picture
is
shown
just
to
show
the
idea
of
straight
line
with
dot
.
actual
target
is
to
show
the
clustering
relation
of
all
lines
coming
from
single
point
.
This
is
not
impossible
to
render
in
Bokeh
(
as
of
0.4.4
)
but
there
is
no
built-in
support
to
help
with
graphs
and
graph
layout
yet
.
You
would
have
to
compute
or
use
a
library
to
compute
the
line
points
for
the
edges
","
etc.
and
then
pass
those
to
Bokeh
.
Graph
support
is
on
our
roadmap
but
it
will
probably
not
be
until
later
this
year
unless
a
complete
PR
gets
dropped
in
our

You
will
need
to
perform
a
query
","
and
depending
how
many
entities
returning
all
them
in
a
single
request
will
either
not
be
possible
or
practical
.
You
will
then
need
to
use
cursors
with
the
query
.
You
should
read
the
section
of
Queries
in
the
ndb
docs

they
are
clear
about
what
needs
to
be
done

simple

It
doesn't
expect
a
method
of
the
entity
thats
why
I
don't
use
toJSON
directly
.
You
may
need
to
fiddle
with
your
toJSON
method
","
have
a
look
at
what
results
looks
like
when
you
run
it
.
results
may
also
need
to
explicitly
converted
to
json
","
so
you
may
want
to
defer
the
explicit
json.encode
till
after
after
you
have
run
the

It

it

IDE
:
PyCharm
Community
Edition
3.1.1
Python
:
2.7.6
I
using
DDT
for
test
parameterization
http://ddt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example.html
I
want
to
choose
and
run
parameterized
test
method
from
test
class
in
PyCharm
->
see
example
:
When
I
navigate
to
the
first
test
method
test_print_value
in
code
and
hit
ctrl+Shift+F10
(
or
use
Run
Unittest
test_print
...
option
from
context
menu
)
then
test
is
executed
.
When
I
try
the
same
with
parameterized
test
I
get
error
:
And
output
contains
:
However
when
I
run
all
tests
in
class
(
by
navigating
to
test
class
name
in
code
and
using
mentioned
run
test
option
)
all
parameterized
and
non
parameterized
tests
are
executed
together
without
errors
.
The
problem
is
how
to
independently
run
prameterized
method
from
the
test
class
-
workaround
is
putting
one
parameterized
test
per
test
class
but
it
is
rather
messy
solution
.
Actually
this
is
issue
in
PyCharm
utrunner.py
who
runs
unittests
.
If
you
are
using
DDT
there
is
a
wrapper
@ddt
and
@data
-
it
is
responsible
for
creating
separate
tests
for
each
data
entry
.
In
the
background
these
tests
have
different
names
e.g
.
This
would
create
tests
named
:
-
test_print_1_1
-
test_print_2_2
When
you
try
to
run
one
test
from
the
class
(
Right
Click
->
Run
'
Unittest
test_print
'
)
PyCharm
has
a
problem
to
load
your
tests
print_1_1
","
print_2_2
as
it
is
trying
to
load
test_print
test
.
When
you
look
at
the
code
of
utrunner.py
:
and
you
will
debug
it
you
see
that
issue
.
Ok
.
So
my
fix
for
that
is
to
load
proper
tests
from
the
class
.
It
is
just
a
workaround
and
it
is
not
perfect
","
however
as
DDT
is
adding
a
TestCase
as
another
method
to
the
class
it
is
hard
to
find
a
different
way
to
detect
right
test
cases
than
comparing
by
string
.
So
instead
of
:
you
can
try
to
use
:
Checking
if
digit
is
found
after
the
main
name
is
a
workaround
to
exclude
similar
test
cases
:
test_print
test_print_another_case
But
of
course
it
would
not
exclude
cases
:
test_if_prints_1
test_if_prints_2
So
in
the
worst
case
","
if
we
haven't
got
a
good
name
convention
we
will
run
similar
tests
","
but
in
most
cases
it
should
just
work
for
you
.
When
I
ran
into
this
error
","
it
was
because
I
had
implemented
an
init
function
as
follows
:
When
I
changed
it
to
the
following
","
it
worked
properly
:
The
problem
was
caused
by
me
not
propagating
the
*
args
and
*
*
kwargs
through
properly
.
If
you
could
slightly
modify
your
call
patterns
","
I
could
imagine
that
it
is
feasible
:
In
this
way
","
you
could
perfectly
make
it
work
with
__getattr__
if
you
make
boot()
return
an
object
which
provides
these
methods
.
If
not
","
you
could
try
one
of
the
following
:
Just
call
cfg.instance.get('a')
Give
Service
a
metaclass
:
Here
the
metaclass
provides
an
appropriate
way
to
deflect
attribute
accesses
to
the
class
to
one
of
its
attributes
.
Be
aware
that
under
Py3
","
the
syntax
is
slightly
different
.
IIRC
","
it
is
(
However
","
it
seems
slightly
wrong
to
me
to
use
the
Service
class
just
for
this
kind
of
encapsulation
.
You
can
do
this
cfg
=
boot(...)
from
my
first
idea
at
one
place
and
subsequently
use
cfg
for
every
access
.
You
might
even
(
misleadingly
)
name
it
Config
:
or
and
subsequently
use
cfg
(
or
Config
)
everywhere
you
want
.

I'm
trying
to
build
a
Service
class
that
holds
the
Registry
instances
.
The
Registry
and
Service
classes
are
the
following
;
What
I
currently
want
is
after
the
boot
function
is
called

The
registry
functions
should
be
accessible
from
Service
class
statically
without
defining
functions
in
Service
class
.
So
","
after
booting
with
the
following
code
","
I
want
to
use
get
function
.
NOTE
:
Config
object
is
an
extension
of
Registry
I've
tried
__getattr__
magic
method
but
it
doesn't
work
on
static
.
I've
tried
__call__
but
after
that
I
need
to
call
Service()
.
get()
which
is
not
that
I
want
.
So
","
is
it
possible
to
make
this
happen
in
python
?
I
don't
want
to
redefine
class
methods
in
Service
layer

NOTE
:
In
PHP
","
there
exists
__callStatic()
function

does
exactly
that
I
want

can't
find
an

called

I'm
preparing
exercises
for
school
classes
involving
Python's
turtle
library

The
students
are
already
drawing
terrific
pictures
","
but
I
want
them
to
be
able
to
detect
existing
pictures
and
colours
in
order
to
modify
the
behaviour
of
their
program
.
For
example
I
would
like
to
provide
them
with
code
which
draws
a
maze
using
turtle
","
and
then
they
can
write
the
code

navigate
the
turtle
around
the
maze

don't
worry
","
I'll
start
simpler
)
.
Is
there
a
way
to
detect
the
colour
of
the
pixels
already
drawn
by
the
turtle

Thanks

Turtle
uses
Tkinter
canvas
","
which
you
can
get
using
turtle.getcanvas()

and
according
to
this
you
cannot
read
the
colour

a
pixel

using
a
workaround
of
converting
the
canvas
to
a
picture
(
bitmap
)
and
read
the
bitmap
.
You
could
try
to
keep
an
open
array
to
work
as
the
bitmap
of
your
canvas
and
update
it
yourself
as
you
draw
new
elements
on
the
canvas

although
that
seems
impractical
unless
the
maze
is
simple

it

After
reading
this
wonderful
article
about
speeding-up
looping
in
Python
by
using
built-in
iterators
and
implicit
loops
I
have
tried
it
in
my
code
.
It
worked
well
on
many
parts
","
but
one
small
part
still
annoys
me
-
the
values
I
iterate
over
are
sometimes
stored
as
fields
of
a
class
which
are
the
dictionary
values
","
and
I
can't
get
rid
of
looping
over
my
dictionary
to
retrieve
them
.
Here
is
a
simplified
version
of
my
code
:
So
the
dictionary
d
have
tuples
(
x
","
y
)
as
keys
and
Pair
instances
as
values
","
and
my
goal
is
to
sum
the
radii
of
the
given
sub_list
of
pairs
(
sub_list
could
be
the
entire
dictionary
)
.
Is
there
any
""""
broadcasting
""""
technique
for
that
","
or
the
loop
in
the
marked
line
is
inevitable
?
BTW
-
I
am
a
beginner
","
so
any
useful
comment
about
the
code
(
including
styling
and
Pythonish
will
be
appreciated
.
Thanks
!
well
your
code
is
not
so
bad
","
though
there's
one
useless
thing
","
which
is
your
object
Pair
.
You
may
just
as
well
store
the
radius
as
value
in
the
dict
:
I
can't
get
rid
of
looping
over
my
dictionary
to
retrieve
them
.
Reread
your
code
!
You're
not
looping
over
the
dictionary
","
you're
iterating
over
the
sub_list
!
Maybe
this
is
a
syntax
problem
","
here's
how
you
could
rewrite
that
iteration
:
And
think
about
it
","
what
you
want
is
to
get
the
precalculated
radius
value
for
each
element
of
the
sublist
.
So
there's
actually
no
other
way
than
iterating
over
the
sublist
!
Whether
you
do
it
using
a
list
comprehension
or
a
map
is
mostly
a
matter
of
personal
preference
","
even
though
the
list
comprehension
is
more
efficient
:
If
you
talk
about
complexity
","
consider
the
size
of
d
being
m
","
and
the
one
of
values
being
n
","
then
:
is
O(n)
!
If
you
didn't
want
A.f()
to
be
called
","
nothing
forces
you
to
use
super()
.
f()
:
The
above
does
exactly
what
your
C
#
code
does
;
create
two
separate
instances
and
invokes
f()
on
each
","
where
B.f()
completely
replaces
what
A.f()
does
.
You
can
still
take
the
unbound
function
from
A
and
pass
in
an
instance
of
B()
:
or
you
could
look
up
the
parent
method
without
a
reference
to
the
parent
class
with
:
This
is
however
quite

uses
the
serial
port

work

configure

then
use

have

The
piece

code

interest

the
following
:
The
""""
DEFAULT_DEVICE
""""
variable
is
the
one

define
the

make
the

correctly
configure

Searching
online
I
have
found
that
simply
putting

work

I
have
tried
in
this
way

when
launching
the
code
I
get
the
raise
"RuntimeError(""unable to configure serial port"")"
defined
in
the
code

Any
idea
of
the
problem
?
Maybe
the
format
I
give
to
DEFAULT_DEVICE

is
not
correct

modify

I
think
you
just

there
is
a
complete
example

calling
a

http://www.sagemath.org/doc/numerical_sage/ctypes.html
You
get
your

this
:
I'm
developing
a
package
that
requires
Python
bindings
for
the
dgtsv
subroutine
from
the
LAPACK
Fortran
library
.
At
the
moment
","
I'm
distributing
the
Fortran
source
file

dgtsv.f
","
alongside
my
Python
code

using
numpy.distutils
to
automatically
wrap
it

compile
it
into
a
shared
library

_gtsv.so
","
that
is
callable
from
Python
.
Here's
what
my
setup.py
file
looks
like
at
the
moment
:
Note
that
in
order
to
actually
use
_gtsv.so
","
I
still
have
to
link
against
a
pre-existing
LAPACK
shared
library
(
extra_link_args
=
[
'
-
llapack
'
]
)
.
Since
this
library
should
already
contain
the
dgtsv
subroutine
","
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
cleaner
to
just
wrap
the
function
in
the
existing
shared
library
","
rather
than
having
to
distribute
the
actual
Fortran
source
.
However
I've
never
come
across
any
examples
of
using
F2PY
to
wrap
functions
that
are
part
of
a
shared
library
rather
than
just
raw
Fortran
source
code

Is
this
possible
?
I
would
like
to
use
a
pyROOT

My
problem
is
that
the

recognize
any

Can
you
tell
me
what
should
I
do

What
I
have
right
now
:
This

partially
obtained

a

I
don't
understand
how

iterating

I'm
getting
hung
up
on

and
keeping
track
of
multiple
counters
and
having
different
lengths
for
the
desired
output
.
I
have
also
tried
this
:
From
the
ever-helpful
itertools
recipes
:
This
includes
the
empty
set
","
but
you
can
trivially
alter
the
range
to
handle
that
.
Here's
one
way
","
using
recursion
","
though
you
can
alternatively
do
it
iteratively
with
a
loop
","
and
join
the
lists
for
each
n
:
or
using
a
list
comprehension
:
it
is
weird
and
i
don't
know
why
urllib2
is
not
working
.
although
i
tried
this
code
working
with
selenium
and
it's
worked
for
me
.
if
you
don't
know
phantomjs
","
it's
just
a
headless
browser
.
you
can
change
phantomjs
with
FireFox
","
it's
still
working
i
want
to
get
html
document
on

web
site
.
this
code
is
working
well
.
but
this
code
is
not
working
.
why
do
not
working
specific
site
?
I'd
suggest
looking
into
a
thread
pool
","
and
having
the
threads
take
tasks
from
a
suitable
shared
data
structure
(
e.g
.
a
queue
)
rather
than
starting
new
threads
all
the
time
.
Depending
on
what
it
is
you
actually
want
to
do
","
if
you're
using
CPython
(
if
you
don't
know
what
I
mean
by
CPython
","
you
will
be
)
you
might
not
actually
get
any
performance
improvement
from
using
threads
(
due
to
global
interpreter
lock
)
.
So
you
might
be
better
off
looking
into
the
multiprocessing
module
.
I
am
using
Threads
from
the
threading
class
for
the
first
time
and
they
don't
seem
to
be
freeing
themselves
up
after
the
function
runs
.
I
am
attempting
to
have
a
max
of
5
threads
running
at
once
.
Since
one
thread
creates
the
next
there
will
be
some
overlap
but
I'm
seeing
2000
+
threads
running
at
once
before
I
get
the
exception
""""
can't
start
new
thread
""""
.
I'm
open
to
any
other
cleaning
up
I
can
do
here
as
well
since
I'm
pretty
new
to
python
and
entirely
new
to
threading
.
I'm
just
trying
to
get
the
threading
set
up
properly
at
this
point
.
Eventually
this
will
scrape
the
URLS
.
You
need
to
use
the
select_related
query
modifier
:
By
using
prefetch_related
","
you
can
walk
the
one-to-many
relationship
and
fetch
all
of
the
photos
in
two
queries
.
One
for
all
of
the
answers
","
and
another
for
all
of
the
photos
which
are
related
to
the
answers
.
I
have
two
models
:
The
relationship
is
one-to-many
(
one
answer
has
many
photos
)
I
need
to
write
a
reporting
function
that
outputs
all
answers
along
with
corresponding
photos
.
Here
is
what
I
have
:
This
works
","
but
as
you
can
see
it
already
","
the
number
of
times
for
photo
in
answer.photos.all()
will
be
executed
equal
to
the
number
of
answers
in
the
db
.
Preferably
","
I
would
like
to
only
execute
two
db
querys
","
one
fetches
all
of
the
answers
and
the
other
fetches
all
of
the
photos
.
So
I
tried
this
:
This
approach
has
decreased
the
number
of
db
queries
down
to
two
but
it
takes
even
longer
to
execute
as
whole
.
9.5
seconds
for
this
approach
vs
7.5
seconds
for
the
1st
approach
.
Any
suggestions
on
how
to
be
more
effcient
?
Thank
you
!
P.S

am

Below

a

","
however
I
have
been
unable

do
so
.
Any
advice

Assume
that
I
have
few
modules
on
my

C
)
.
They
shares
the

will
manage
the
login
/
logout
actions

I
do

verification
codes
on

3
modules
.
Is
there
anyway
for
me
to
put
a
middleware
that
run
before
all
3
modules
for
each
request
.
Such
as
X
:
it
will

some
user's
information
if
the
user
has
logged
in
.
I.E
:
after
I
can
implement
my
above
idea
.
Each
request
will
run

What
do

Thanks
Update
1
:
more
information
The
middleware
","
I
mean
the
request
middle
ware
.
If
X
is
a
middleware
then
it
will
be
run
before
the
request
is
passed
to
the
app
(
or
module
)
","
it
will
change
the
request
only
such
as
:
Do
some
authentication
actions
Add
some
headers
:
X-User-Id
:
for
authorized
user
id
X-User-Scopes
:
for
scopes
of
authorized
user
etc
...
And
of
course
","
it
is
independent
to
the
inside
module's
language
(
PHP
or
Python
or
Java
or
...
)
The
X
middleware
should
be
configured
at
app.yaml
.
The
way
I
approached
such
scenario
(
in
a
python-only
project
","
donno
about
php
)
was
to
use
a
custom
handler
(
inheriting
webapp2.RequestHandler
which
I
was
already
using
for
session
support
)
.
In
its
customized
dispatch()
method
the
user
info
is
collected
and
stored
in
the
handler
object
itself
.
The
implementation
of
the
handler
exists
in
only
one
version
controlled
file
","
but
which
is
symlinked
(
for
GAE
accessibility
)
in
each
module
that
references
the
handler
.
This
way
I
don't
have
to
manage
multiple
independent
copies
of
the
user
and
session
verification
code
.
There
are
two
ways
you
can
get
a
row
count
in
DynamoDB
.
The
first
is
performing
a
full
table
scan
and
counting
the
rows
as
you
go
.
For
a
table
of
any
reasonable
size
this
is
generally
a
horrible
idea
as
it
will
consume
all
of
your
provisioned
read
throughput
.
The
other
way
is
to
use
the
Describe
Table
request
to
get
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
rows
in
the
table
.
This
will
return
instantly
","
but
will
only
be
updated
periodically
per
the
AWS
documentation
.
The
number
of
items
in
the
specified
index
.
DynamoDB
updates
this
value
approximately
every
six
hours
.
Recent
changes
might
not
be

in
this

.

UPDATE
:
I
installed
django
CMS
inside
the
virtualenv
like
this
:
pip
freeze
:
This
problem
is
solved
in
support
/
3.1.x
branch
of
django-cms
.
You
can
checkout
it
or
wait
the
next
release
:
3.1.3
tag
.
The
recommended
way
is
using
Celery
.
If
you
want
don't
want
to
use
async
task
handling
you
can
also
just
create
a
custom
management
command
and
run
it
via
cron
.
Both
of
them
should
work
with
the
whole
projects
context
(
e.g
.
what
your
defined
in
your
settings
)
","
so
you
can
use
the
Django
ORM
to
connect
to
your
DB
etc..
I
am
setting
up
backend
for
an
application
","
with
Django
and
MySQL
.
As
a
part
of
the
set
up
","
I
need
to
keep
on
fetching
latest
content
from
Facebook
and
Twitter
Graph
APIs
and
keep
updating
my
database
with
that
.
The
user
of
my
application
would
pull
this
latest
available
data
from
the
database
.
Now
","
how
and
where
I
implant
this
code
?
Shall
I
put
it
somewhere
in
the
Django
project
","
if
yes
","
then
where
?
Or
shall
I
use
it
as
an
independent
script
i.e.
not
attached
to
Django
in
anyway
","
and
update
the
DB
directly
with
that
.
Also
since
this
would
be
a
continuous
process
","
I
need
it
to
run
as
background
task
.
It
should
not
eat
consume
any
resources
that
might
be
needed
by
the
foreground
tasks
.
I
am
trying
to
retrive
reviews
from
trip
advisor
and
instead
of
writing
code
I
diciced
to
use
the
shell
that
scrapy
comes
with
.
While
I
was
testing
this
Xpath
I
am
getting
invalid
syntax
error
.
Try
Assume
that
I
have
the
following
data
set
Now
","
I'd
like
to
find
the
last
value
of
each
month
","
move
it
monthwise
to
the
values
of
the
next
month
","
and
finally
take
the
cumulative
product
of
these
values
.
Doing
this
procedure
for
the
above
data
should
result
in
(
performing
each
step
)
:
Finding
the
last
entry
of
each
month
and
moving
them
monthwise
would
result
in
Filling
the
NaN's
with
1
","
taking
the
cumulative
product
","
and
dropping
temp
would
result
in
I
hope
that
this
is
clear
enough
.
And
if
anyone
wonders
why
on
earth
I'd
like
to
do
this
is
because
I've
got
MTD-data
","
and
it
needs
to
be
resampled
.
Thanks

Tingis
.
edit
The
number
of
entries
per
month
are
""""
random
""""
","
as
in
they
can
either
be
as
long
as
the
month
or
shorter
(
business
data
...
)
The
following
code
does
not
assume
that
you
have
only
two
rows
for
each
month
.
The
idea
is
that
do
the
group-wise
calculation
first
","
and
then
populate
some
NaN
using
.
reindex()
and
fill
those
NaNs
using
backward
fill
as
we've
got
the
value
for
the
very
last
entry
of
each
month
.
For
the
follow-ups
question
:
I
have
a
string
And
for
some
reason
the
same
string
with
added
characters
(
'
-
'
","
'
.
'
)
I
want
to
map
the
index
of
a
character
from
s1
to
s2
Example:s1:0
-->
s2:2
","
s1:5
-->
s2:9
...
Ok
","
so
something
like
this
should
work
:
I
solved
by
:
counting
the
number
of
occurrence
of
the
character
in
s1
at
position
i
and
then
find
the
character
s1
[i]
in
s2
that
has
the
same
number
of
occurrence
Note
I
found
the
find_nth
here
you
may
use
two
stack
for
each
(
s1
","
s2)with
index
as
key
and
character
as
value
then
pop
the
values
from
each
compare
them
and
generate
required
output
.
You
can
try
something
like
this
:
I
am
trying
to
parse
data
from
server
and
want
to
store
it
in
file
but
I
am
getting
Unexpected
EOF
while
parsing
.
I
am
very
newbie
on
python
.
Here
is
my
code
.
Please
give
me
any
reference
or
hint
.
You
forget
to
add
a
closing
bracket
.
or
You
need
a
queue
that
is
shared
between
processes
.
One
process
adds
to
the
queue
","
the
other
processes
from
the
queue
.
Here
is
a
simplified
example
:
If
you
want
to
only
process
10
things
at
a
time
","
you
can
limit
the
queue
size
to
10
.
This
means
","
the
""""
writer
""""
cannot
write
anything
until
if
the
queue
already
has
10
items
waiting
to
be
processed
.
By
default
","
the
queue
has
no
bounds
/
limits
.
The
documentation
is
a
good
place
to
start
for
more
on
queues
.
I
have
a
situation
where
I
have
to
read
and
write
the
list
simultaneously
.
It
seems
the
code
starts
to
read
after
it
completes
writing
all
the
elements
in
the
list.What
I
want
to
do
is
that
the
code
will
keep
on
adding
elements
in
one
end
and
I
need
to
keep
on
processing
first
10
elements
simultaneously
.
You
can
do
like
this
PS
:
assuming
y
is
an
infinite
stream
You
can
use
the
Flask
session
object
which
does
exactly
what
you
want
:
A
session
basically
makes
it
possible
to
remember
information
from
one
request
to
another
.
Also
","
a
session
is
basically
a
python
dictionary
where
you
can
store
info
between
requests
.
See
here
a
small
example
on
using
session
and
the
secret_key
which
it
requires
.
If
security
is
your
primary
concern
you
should
use
the
isdangerous
module
which
is
more
secure
than
the
default
werkzeug
session
.
Update
Another
possibility
is
to
use
server-side
sessions
to
store
the
session
data
in
the
database
.
There
is
even
an
extension
-
Flask-KVSession
-
which
stores
session
data
on
a
variety
of
backends
.
Here
is
the
situation
:
I
am
using
nginx
","
uwsgi
","
python3.4
","
flask
for
a
web
service
.
In
the
login
process
","
I
want
to
setup
a
global
variable
to
hold
the
{
'
token':'user_id
'
}
dictionary
for
fast
user
token
validation
.
I
have
tried
two
ways
.
The
first
is
using
flask.g
.
But
","
the
problem
is
that
the
flask.g
global
variable
can
not
share
data
between
requests
.
The
second
is
using
app's
config
dictionary
","
but
the
app.config
dictionary
will
changed
when
uwsgi
reloaded
.
Could
someone
tell
me
how
to
achieve
the
goal
?
Turns
out
it
was
quite
straight
forward
.
I
added
following
function
:
Then
I
replaced
this
line
:
By
this

like
a
charm

and
am
getting
the

described
in
this
issue
.
To
resolve
it

I
would

to

However
I
am
not
sure
how

apply
this

my
code

issue
explains

not
user-bound

however
it
is
not

looking
for
a
solution
with
this
small
selenium

problem
happens

As
you

tried
to
use
css

I
have
seen
some
solution
with
regular

$

i
don't
how
it
works
.
EDIT
:
I'm
looking
to
select
only
the
third
element
""""

as
you
see
there
are
thee
times

Don't

it
will
try
to
search
subString

If
you
remove

then
it
will
try
to
match
only

Another
clean
solution
is
to
download
the
wheel
file
for
SciPy(compatiable with your architecture of Python)

use
pip

pythonModule.whl

to
do
this

I
stumbled
upon
this
website

has
many
Python
modules

Just
another
way
to
do
it
if
you
don't

this
case
numpy
installs
well

scipy
fails

error
:

Install
Scipy

this
it
installs

on
importing

an
error
not
valid

As
its
32bit

Use

Installation
goes
well

Some
posts
suggested
to

can
solve
the
issue
.
Installing
scientific
Python
modules
from
sources
on
Windows
is
a
bit
complex
and
not
very
maintainable
.
A
more
reliable
solution
is
to
use
a
scientific
python
distribution
","
such
as
Anaconda
or
Enthought
Canopy
.
Edit
:
I
understand
this
answer
is
opinion
based
","
however
I
am
not
aware
of
other
simple
and
open-source
way
to
deploy
scientific
python
modules
on
Windows
.
Sure
you
could
install
scipy
from
sources
or
with
pip
","
however
in
a
wider
picture
","
if
you
need
Numpy
","
Scipy
","
IPython
and
Matplotlib
","
etc.
that's
just
not
a
workable
solution
.
insert
a
dictionary
into
the
Counter
update
","
like
this
:
Counter.update(iterable)
takes
an
iterable
(
hint
:
a
Python
string
IS
an
iterable
)
and
updates
the
count
for
each
item
of
the
iterable
-
so
what
you
get
is
really
what
is
to
be
expected
.
If
you
really
want
to
use
Counter.update()
here
","
you
have
to
pass
either
a
dict
with
'
1:2:3
'
as
key
and
1
as
value
or
a
sequence
of
(
key
","
value
)
tuples
(
ie
[
(
""""
1:2:3
""""
","
1
)
","
]
)
.
Else
you
can
of
course
use
the
ordinary
dict
syntax
as
mentioned
by
Daniel
Roseman
-
which
really
is
the
thing
to
do
if
you
have
no
other
reason
to
use
update()
.
A
Counter
is
basically
a
dict

All
you
need

to

the
C
+
+
code
with
a
Python
wrapper
.
Elaborated
:
Suppose
your
C
+
+
code
is
inside
class_file.h
.
In
the
same
directory

create
a

pxd
file
with
any
name

your
choice

the
following
content
This
is
the
wrapper
of
the
C
+
+
file

That's
all
you
have
to
do

Cython

Further
you
need
to
write
a
.
pyx
file
and
cimport
your
pxd
file
like
a
simple

also
need

will
create
a

can
be

very
easy

2.Create

my
experience
boost::python

the
best
way
to
go
about
it

it

you

price
you

start

You

the

must
already
adhere
to
any

Try
something
like
this
:
In
the
context
of
a
model
I'm
generating

I
at
one
point

generate

distribution

an

numbers

I'll
leave
out

are
proportional
to
probabilities
I
next
need
to
use
in
a
multinomial
sampling
procedure
","
so
the
obvious
approach
is
simply
this
:
But
this
(
sometimes
)
doesn't
work
!
Basically
the
sum
of
arr
/
arr.sum()
ends
up
being
greater
than
1
.
In
principle
this
should
be
mathematically
impossible
","
but
I'm
assuming
this
boils
down
to
a
floating-point
precision
issue
.
Here's
a
trivial
example
of
how
this
can
happen
:
So
long
story
short
","
my
question
is
how
best
to
deal
with
this
.
I
can
cheat
by
simply
adding
a
very
small
number
to
the
sum
","
i.e.
:
But
this
is
really
hackish
","
and
I
fear
it
may
introduce
further
unwanted
precision
issues
.
Is
there
a
better
solution
?
Start
by
reading
https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html
In
a
nutshell
","
floating
point
can't
really
represent
0.05
.
The
effect
is
minute
:
The
correct
solution
is
to
define
the
desired
precision
for
each
mathematical
operation
","
calculate
the
round
errors
of
each
step
and
round
accordingly
when
necessary
.
In
your
case
","
you
can
round
to
5
digits
since
you're
only
adding
a
few
numbers
.
But
for
more
complex
calculations
which
need
to
be
correct
","
you
will
have
to
do
the
error
assessment

nothing
happens

I
have
been
able
to
set
the

the

those
work
fine

Here
is
my

out
?
SET_ATTITUDE_TARGET
is

It
is
not
possible
to
set
the
attitude
directly
because
the
command
is
not
supported
by

mode

AUTO
mode

you

Another
(
hacky

approach
that
may
work

setting

Presumably
the

In
my
experience
the

a
pain

work

it

ended
up

What
worked
for
me
was
to
check
the
default
sample
rate
of
the
audio
out

check
that
its
the
same

play
sounds
back

numpy
arrays

check

I
can't
figure
out
where's
the
problem
.
Thanks
for
taking
your
time
.
The
treeview
widget
has
a
method
named
column
which
lets
you
specify
options
for
a
given
column
.
One
of
the
options
is
stretch
","
which
lets
you
determine
whether
the
column
should
stretch
and
shrink
when
the
widget
is
resized
.
You
can
also
use
the
width
attribute
to
specify
the
starting
size
.
These
two
combined
should
cause
your
treeview
to
appear
with
all
of
the
columns
fitting
on
the
screen
.
I
have
been
messing
around

This
is
usually
a
problem
when
you're
using
a
version
of
Python
other
than
the
one
Panda3D
is
compiled
with
.
If
you
are
using
the
1.9.0
Lion
build
of
Panda3D

make
sure
you
are
using
the
system-provided
copy
of
Python
2.7
","
by
explicitly
running
""""
python2.7
""""

""""

which
should
be
a
symlink

correct

I
was
writing
an
automation
script
in
python
that
dealt
with
sending
commands
through
a
Telnet
session
.
For
some
reason
I
couldn't
get
it
to
work
.
After
a
ton
of
frustrating
debugging
","
I
found
that
when
I
was
translating
a
command
of

The
-
in
the
command
became
something
weird
in
utf-8

I
had
to
translate
it
in
bytes
because
I
was
sending
it
using
Telnet
(
I
know
I
should
use
ssh
","
but
it
honestly
is
fine
in
my
case
)
and
I
realized
it
was
weird
because
when
I
printed
the
command
in
bytes
it
would
be
:
I
don't
remember
the
exact
numbers
","
but
I
fixed
it
by
copying
and
pasting
a
new
""""
-
""""
that
I
used
two
lines
up
in
the
function
and
worked
fine
.
I
did
copy
and
paste
in
the
part
from
two
lines
up
","
but
I
typed
the
ulimit
-
s
part
.
I
was
also
using
IDLE
Anyone
know
what
happened
?
You
managed
to
enter
something
like
an
U+2013
EN
DASH
or
an
U+2014
EM
DASH
","
which
both
look
a
lot
like
the
ASCII
character
U+002D
HYPHEN
MINUS
.
Because
either
of
these
characters
are
outside
of
the
basic
Latin-1
alphabet
","
encoding
either
one
of
these
to
UTF-8
results
in
a
3-byte
sequence
:
Those
two
are
not
the
only
confusable
characters
;
a
few
more
:
U+2010
HYPHEN

etc.
Anyone
know
what
happened
?
I
can
see
two
possibilities
here
.
One
is
that
you
inadvertently
copy-pasted
a
line
of
code
from
a
Web
page
or
other
document
where
the
-
had
been
replaced
by
an
emdash
(
it
usually
happens
to
me
with
quote
signs
and
typographic
quote
signs
)
","
which
looks
like
a
minus
sign
but
it's
a
UTF8
multibyte
sequence
.
The
other
is
that
somehow
the
IDLE
editor
effected
a
""""
spelling
check
""""
like
that
of
Microsoft
Word
","
which
replaces
(
among
others
)
quote
signs
with
typographic
quote
signs
","
three
consecutive
dots
with
an
ellipsis
and
minus
signs
with
emdashes
.
This
might
have
been
triggered
by
some
rare
keystroke
combination
typed
in
error
(
for
example
I
sometimes
trigger
the
Windows
7
Screen
Magnifier
while
trying
to
type
in
","
I
think
","
a
{
symbol
-
which
on
my
keyboard
is
Shift
AltGr
[
)
.
It's
not
that
I
think
the
following
is
more
readable
than
what
you
have
","
but
it
only
uses
list
comprehensions
.
Say
you
have
Then
a
dictionary
of
the
mean
can
be
found
with
For
the
variance
","
note
that
","
by
the
definition
of
variance
V
[X]
=
E
[x2]
-
(
E
[X]
)
2
","
so
","
if
you
define
:
then
the
variance
dictionary
is
I'm
wondering
whether
there
is
a
Pythonic
way
to
compute
the
means
and
variances
of
Counters
?
For
example
","
I
have
four
Counters
sharing
the
same
keys
:
My
way
to
do
that
is
:
I
could
use
the
following
code
to
find
the
mean
/
variance
for
each
key
:
Is
there
an
easier
way
to
compute
the
mean
/
variance
for
each
key
compared
to
my
way
?
I
have
written
code
that
separates
the
characters
at
'
even
'
and
'
odd
'
indices
","
and
I
would
like
to
modify
it
so
that
it
separates
characters
by
upper
/
lower
case
.
I
can't
figure
out
how
to
do
this
for
a
string
such
as
""""
AbBZxYp
""""
.
I
have
tried
using
.
lower
and
.
upper
but
I
think
I'm
using
them
incorrectly
.
Btw
","
for
odd
/
even
index
you
could
just
do
this
:
There
is
an
itertools
recipe
called
partition
that
can
do
this
.
Here
is
the
implementation
:
From
itertools
recipes
:
Upper
and
Lowercase
Letters
You
can
manually
implement
the
latter
recipe
","
or
install
a
library
that
implements
it
for
you
","
e.g
.
pip
install
more_itertools
:
Here
partition
uses
a
predicate
function
to
determine
if
each
item
in
an
iterable
is
lowercase
.
If
not
","
it
is
filtered
into
the
false
group
.
Otherwise
","
it
is
filtered
into
the
group
of
true
items
.
We
iterate
to
expose
these
groups
.
Even
and
Odd
Indices
You
can
modify
this
to
work
for
odd
and
even
indices
as
well
:
Here
we
zip
an
itertools.count()
object
to
enumerate
the
iterable
.
Then
we
iterate
the
children
so
that
the
sub
items
yield
the
letters
only
.
See
also
more_itertools
docs
for
more
tools
.
Are
you
looking
to
get
two
strings
","
one
with
all
the
uppercase
letters
and
another
with
all
the
lowercase
letters
?
Below
is
a
function
that
will
return
two
strings
","
the
upper
then
the
lowercase
:
You
can
then
call
it
with
the
following
:
which
gives
you
two
variables
","
upper
and
lower
.
Use
them
as
necessary
.
What
others
have
said
about
not
doing
circular
imports
is
the
best
solution
","
but
if
you
end
up
absolutely
needing
them
","
it's
usually
within
just
one
method
or
function
of
one
of
the
modules
.
Thus
you
can
safely
do
this
:
There's
a
slight
overhead
to
doing
the
import each
time
the
function
is
called
","
but
it
is
rather
low
unless
it's
called
all
the
time
.
the
webhandler
module
needs
access
to
several
variables
that
are
generated
in
the
datahandler
module
It
might
make
sense
to
push
any
""""
generated
""""
data
to
a
third
location
.
So
datahandler
functions
call
"config.setvar( name, value )"
when
appropriate
and
webhandler
functions
call
config.getvar( name )
when
they
need
to
.
config
would
be
a
third
sub-module
","
containing
simple
setvar
and
getvar
functions
that
you
write
(
wrappers
around
setting
/
getting
elements
of
a
global
dictionary
would
be
the
simplest
approach
)
.
Then
the
datahandler
code
would
import webhandler
","
config
but
webhandler
would
only
need
to
import config
.
I
agree
with
poke
however
","
that
the
need
for
such
a
question
betrays
the
fact
that
you
probably
haven't
yet
got
the
design
finalized
as
neatly
and
logically
as
you
thought
.
If
it
were
me
","
I
would
re-think
the
way
modules
are
divided
up
.
Circular
dependencies
are
a
form
of
code
smell
.
If
you
have
two
modules
that
depend
on
each
other
","
then
that’s
a
very
bad
sign
","
and
you
should
restructure
your
code
.
There
are
a
few
different
ways
to
do
this
;
which
one
is
best
depends
on
what
you
are
doing
","
and
what
parts
of
each
module
are
actually
used
by
another
.
A
very
simple
solution
would
be
to
just
merge
both
modules
","
so
you
only
have
a
single
module
that
only
depends
on
itself
","
or
rather
on
its
own
contents
.
This
is
simple
","
but
since
you
had
separated
modules
before
","
it’s
likely
that
you
are
introducing
new
problems
that
way
because
you
no
longer
have
a
separation
of
concerns
.
Another
solution
would
be
to
make
sure
that
the
dependencies
are
actually
required
.
If
there
are
only
a
few
parts
of
a
module
that
depend
on
the
other
","
maybe
you
could
move
those
bits
around
in
a
way
that
the
circular
dependency
is
no
longer
required
","
or
utilize
the
way
imports
work
to
make
the
circular
dependencies
no
longer
a
problem
.
The
better
solution
would
probably
be
to
move
the
dependencies
into
a
separate
new
module
.
If
naming
is
really
the
hardest
problem
about
that
","
then
you’re
probably
doing
it
right
.
It
might
“
ruin
the
organisation
of
[your]
program
”
but
since
you
have
circular
dependencies
","
there
is
something
inherently
wrong
with
your
setup
anyway
.
Ok
so
it
is
like
this
.
I'd
rather
not
give
away
my
code
but
if
you
really
need
it
I
will
.
I
have
two
modules
that
need
a
bit
from
each
other
.
the
modules
are
called
webhandler
and
datahandler
.
In
webhandler
I
have
a
line
:
and
in
datahandler
I
have
another
line
:
Now
I
know
this
is
terrible
code
and
a
circular
import like
this
causes
the
code
to
run
twice
(
which
is
what
im
trying
to
avoid
)
.
However
the
datahandler
module
needs
to
access
several
functions
from
the
webhandler
module
","
and
the
webhandler
module
needs
access
to
several
variables
that
are
generated
in
the
datahandler
module
.
I
dont
see
any
workaround
other
than
moving
functions
to
different
modules
but
that
would
ruin
the
organisation
of
my
program
and
make
no
logical
sense
with
the
module
naming
.

for
in
a
text
file
looks
like
:
My
desired
output
would
just
be
2
and
2
because
I'm
looking
for
the
number
that
follows
the
text
.
fi2Content
represent
a
whole
text
file
read
by
Python
.
I
can
print(zDiscs)
but
I
can't
print(zDiscs.group(2)
)
.
Why
?
I
get
the
following
error
:
when
I
try
to
print(zDiscs.group(2)
)
Here's
my
whole
script
if
that
helps
troubleshooting
can
get
the
raw
text
of
the
file
if
there's
a
way
to
pass
that
directly
to
configparser
Try
configparser.ConfigParser.read_string
When
coupled
with
an
appropriate
ZIP
file
","
this
code
works
for
me
:
Upon
reflection
","
the
following
might
be
more
appropriate
:
ZipFile
not
only
supports
read
but
also
open
","
which
returns
a
file-like
object
.
So
","
you
could
do
something
like
this
:
I
am
creating
a
program
that
loads
and
runs
python
scripts
from
a
compressed
file
.
Along
with
those
python
scripts
","
I
have
a
config
file
that
I
previously
used
configparser
to
load
info
from
in
an
uncompressed
version
of
the
program
.
Is
it
possible
to
directly
read
config
files
in
zip
files
directly
with
configparser
?
or
do
I
have
to
unzip
it
into
a
temp
folder
and
load
it
from
there
?
I
have
tried
directly
giving
the
path
:
Didn't
work
.
no
surprises
there
.
Then
I
tried
using
zipfile
and
found
that
it
didn't
work
either
.
so
I've
resorted
to
creating
a
temp
folder
","
uncompressing
to
it
","
and
reading
the
conf
file
there
.
I
would
really
like
to
avoid
this
if
possible
as
the
conf
files
are
the
only
limiting
factor
.
I
can
(
and
am
)
loading
the
python
modules
from
the
zip
file
just
fine
at
this
point
.
I
can
get
the
raw
text
of
the
file
if
there's
a
way
to
pass
that
directly
to
configparser
","
but
searching
the
docs
I
came
up
empty
handed
.
Update
:
I
tried
using
stringIO
as
a
file
object
","
and
it
seems
to
work
somewhat
.
configparser
doesn't
reject
it
","
but
it
doesn't
like
it
either
.
If
I
use
read_file
instead
","
it
doesn't
error
out
","
but
doesn't
load
anything
either
.
I
get
a
Local
variable
'
first
'
referenced
before
assignment
error
when
I
run
my
code
.
That
is
just
a
part
of
my
code
where
the
error
occurs
.
However
when
I
paste
the
code
into
IDLE
it
works
no
problem
so
I
don't
know
why
this
is
happening
.
Anyways
","
my
full
code
(
unfinished
Tic
Tac
Toe
)
:
Python
scans
a
function
body
for
any
assignments
","
and
if
they
aren't
explicitly
declared
global
","
then
it
creates
a
local
scope
variable
for
that
name
.
Because
you
assign
to
first
in
your
reverse()
function
","
and
you
haven't
explicitly
declared
first
to
be
global
within
that
function's
scope
","
python
creates
a
local
variable
named
first
that
hides
the
global
one
.
It
doesn't
matter
that
the
assignment
comes
after
the
comparison
;
python
implicitly
declares
all
local
variables
at
the
beginning
of
the
function
.
To
fix
this
you
can
declare
first
to
be
global
within
the
reverse()
function
","
but
as
others
have
said
","
globals
should
be
avoided
when
possible
.
It's
a
good
question
","
with
not
an
easy
to
find
answer
.
The
main
difference
is
that
local-name
(
)
does
not
consider
prefixes
(
namespaces
)
for
tags
.
For
example
","
given
a
node
<
x:html
"xmlns:x=""http"
:
/
/
www.w3.org
/
1999
/
xhtml
""""
/
>
","
the
local-name
will
match
the
html
tag
","
while
/
/
html
will
not
work
","
and
neither
will
/
/
x:html
.
Please
consider
the
following
code
","
if
you
have
any
questions
feel
free
to
ask
.
Show
me
the
code
Setup
:
It
is
now
not
possible
to
use
the
tag
selector
:
But
using
local-name
we
can
still
get
the
element
(
considering
the
namespace
)
Or
strict
namespace
using
name()
:
Performance
I
parsed
this
website
as
a
tree
and
used
the
following
queries
:
Now
onto
actual
namespaces
.
I
parsed
a
block
from
here
.
Conclusion
I
had
to
rewrite
to
conclusion
since
after
using
the
namespace
method
it
became
obvious
that
the
gain
when
using
namespaces
is
also
there
.
Roughly
2
times
faster
when
specifying
the
namespace
(
causing
optimizations
)
","
rather
than
using
local-name
.
I'm
using
lxml
on
Python
2.7
.
Given
a
node
","
node
and
a
child
","
child_element
","
what
is
the
difference
between
these
:
node.xpath('./child_element')
"node.xpath(""*[local-name()"
=
'
child_element
'
]
""""
)
In
other
words
","
what's
going
on
under
the
hood
here
?
Is
there
any
reason
one
ought
to
be
""""
better
""""
than
another
(
in
terms
of
performance
or
correctness
)
?
I've
read
through
the
lxml
docs
and
a
good
deal
of
other
XPath
query
resources
and
am
not
finding
any
real
clarification
.
So
","
it's
a
little
hacky
","
but
should
be
relatively
robust
.
There
are
two
main
negatives
here
:
Repeated
calls
to
fromstring
means
that
this
code
isn't
extremely
fast
.
About
the
same
speed
as
parsing
each
document
individually
","
much
slower
than
if
it
were
all
one
document
Errors
are
thrown
relative
to
the
current
location
in
the
document
.
It
would
be
easy
to
add
relative
location
support
(
just
adding
an
accumulator
to
keep
track
of
current
location
)
Basically
the
approach
is
to
find
the
thrown
errors
and
then
parse
just
the
section
of
the
file
above
the
error
.
If
an
error
that
isn't
related
to
the
last
of
a
root
node
is
thrown
then
it
is
handled
like
a
typical
exception
.
The
find_nth
code
is
shamelessly
stolen
from
this
question
.
It's
possible
that
there
aren't
many
situations
where
this
code
is
deeply
useful
","
but
for
me
with
a
large
number
of
slightly
irregular
documents
(
very
common
with
academic
data
)
it's
invaluable
.
XML
documents
must
have
a
single
root
element
;
otherwise
","
they
are
not
well-formed
","
and
are
","
in
fact
","
not
XML
.
Conformant
parsers
cannot
parse
non-well-formed
""""
XML
""""
.
When
you
construct
your
single
XML
document
out
of
multiple
documents
","
simply
wrap
the
disparate
root
elements
in
a
single
root
element
.
Then
you'll
be
able
to
use
standard
parsers
such
as
lxml
.
So
","
I
assume
this
is
a
pretty
typical
use
case
","
but
I
can't
really
find
anything
about
support
for
this
in
the
lxml
documentation
.
Basically
I've
got
an
xml
file
that
consists
of
a
number
of
distinct
xml
documents
(
reviews
in
particular
)
The
structure
is
approximately
:
Basically
","
I
try
to
read
the
file
in
like
so
:
But
I
get
an
error
when
I
do
so
:
Totally
reasonable
error
","
in
fact
it
is
an
xml
error
and
should
be
treated
as
such
","
but
my
question
is
:
how
do
I
get
lxml
to
recognize
that
this
is
a
list
of
xml
documents
and
to
parse
accordingly
?
Is
magic
a
real
lxml
function
?
How
do
you
run
a
Python
script
from
within
Notepad
+
+
that
opens
in
Windows
Powershell
and
runs
the
script
from
the
directory
that
the
Python
script
is
located
even
if
there
is
a
space
in
the
directory
path
.
To
be
able
to
run
a
Python
script
in
Powershell
you
can
press
F5
to
open
the
run
dialog
box
","
to
run
the
python
script
in
powershell
normally
you
can
use
;
This
however
opens
up
Powershell
in
an
ugly
format
similar
to
what
cmd
looks
like
by
default
however
it
does
have
all
the
features
","
it
also
does
not
run
the
script
from
the
directory
so
relative
paths
don't
work
.
To
make
the
Powershell
look
normal
you
should
run
it
from
the
shortcut
that
is
in
the
start
menu
","
to
allow
it
to
work
if
the
file
path
has
a
space
in
it
you
should
put
a
\
before
the
quotation
marks
.
The
working
run
command
is
therefore
;
Everything
I
found
about
this
via
searching
was
either
wrong
or
incomplete
in
some
way
.
So
","
how
do
I
:
delete
everything
in
my
postgresql
database
delete
all
my
alembic
revisions
make
it
so
that
my
database
is
100
%
like
new
This
works
for
me
:
1
)
Access
your
session
","
in
the
same
way
you
did
session.create_all
","
do
session.drop_all
.
2
)
Delete
the
migration
files
generated
by
alembic
.
3
)
Run
session.create_all
and
initial
migration
generation
again
.
No
idea
how
to
mess
with
alembic
","
but
for
the
database
","
you
can
just
log
into
the
SQL
console
and
use
DROP
DATABASE
foo
.
Or
were
you
wanting
to
clear
out
all
the
data
","
but
leave
the
tables
there
?
If
so
","
Truncating
all
tables
in
a
postgres
database
has
some
good
answers
.
So
in
order
to
parse
a
JSON
with
bash
","
I
use
python
-
mjson.tool
to
grep
the
field
and
awk
to
get
the
value
.
I
used
to
pipe
it
right
after
curl
","
so
I
could
do
something
like
curl
$url
|
python
-
mjson.tool
|
grep
(
something
)
|
awk
(
something
)
But
I
want
to
store
the
curl
output
to
a
variable
and
send
that
to
the
python
-
mjson.tool
.
I
tried
python
-
mjson.tool
$json
or
python
-
mjson.tool
<
<
<
$json
but
neither
has
worked
.
Is
there
a
way
to
feed
in
a
json
variable
to
python
?
Also
","
I
cannot
use
jq
.
In
bash
","
you
need
to
quote
the
variable
.
If
you
don't
","
it
will
collapse
the
whitespace
:
Consider
the
sliders_app.py
example
in
Bokeh
.
I
would
like
to
have
the
ability
to
update
the
plot
at
regular
time
intervals
.
For
example
","
say
we
want
to
time-shift
the
plot
every
10
seconds
.
How
can
I
do
this
in
the
context
of
an
app
?
To
illustrate
the
goal
","
I
would
like
to
add
the
following
extremely
simple
logic
to
the
app
that
simply
shifts
X
and
Y
cyclically
.
Note
that
there
is
no
easy
way
to
insert
this
loop
into
the
original
sliders_app.py
(
where
would
it
go
?
)
.
Is
there
any
way
to
do
this
in
Bokeh
?
Does
Bokeh
perhaps
have
any
timer
widgets
to
which
one
could
hook
up
a
timer
callback
to
update
data
sources
?
If
not
","
is
there
a
plan
to
incorporate
this
functionality
some
time
down
the
road
?
Update
It
looks
like
spectrogram.py
uses
threading
to
handle
this
type
of
updates
.
For
anyone
interested
","
this
may
be
the
way
to
pull
it
off
.
There
are
a
few
options
.
The
AjaxDataSource
can
cause
the
client
to
pull
from
a
REST
endpoint
directly
","
on
a
periodic
basis
.
Here
is
an
example
that
shows
its
use
:
https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/master/examples/plotting/file/ajax_source_realtime.py
Note
that
the
spectrogram
will
probably
be
rewritten
soon
to
use
this
","
and
reduce
the
amount
of
JS
that
is
written
by
hand
.
(
The
spectrogram
is
fairly
sophisticated
and
has
some
custom
JS
","
we
are
always
trying
to
reduce
that
amount
over
time
)
Also
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
the
threading
in
the
spectrogram
has
to
do
with
the
server
side
of
things
","
it
does
not
really
have
anything
to
do
with
Bokeh
","
per
se
","
or
with
getting
updates
into
Bokeh
.
If
you
are
running
an
app
in
the
Bokeh
server
","
you
can
simply
update
the
data
source
model
however
often
you
like
","
and
the
plot
will
respond
.
This
is
how
you
get
content
of
an
e-mail
i.e.
*
.
eml
file
.
This

well

I
programmed
this
for
my
mailgroup

mailbox

that
is
why
it
is
so
convoluted

me

all
filenames
of
extracted
other

that
were
not
text

.
That
was
a
way
of
extracting
attachments
and
other
binary
data
.
You
may
change
it
in
pullout()
","
or
just
change
the
behaviour
of
file_exists()

save_file()

there
is
one

In
pullout()
the

OK

If
you
need

more
sophisticated
change

lists

append
to
them

add
them
as
needed
.
Nothing
problematic
.
Maybe
there
are
some
errors
here
","
because
it
is
intended
to
work
with
mailbox.Message()
","
not

I
tried
it

you
""""

From
where
?
If
you
refer
to
the
POP3
mailbox

a
mailbox
of
some
nice
open-source
mailer
","
then
you
do
it
using
mailbox
module
.
If
you
want
to
list
them

others
","
then
you
have
a
problem
.
For
example
","
to
get

Outlook
","
you
have
to
know
how

Other
mailers
rarely
refer
to
them
as

.
eml

","
so
I
think
this
is
exactly
what
you
would
like
to
do
.
Then
search
on
PyPI
for
olefile
or
compoundfiles
module
and
Google
around
for
how
to
extract
an
e-mail
from
MS
Outlook
inbox
file
.
Or
save
yourself
a
mess
and
just
export
them
from
there
to
some
directory
.
When
you
have
them
as
eml
files
","
then
apply
this
code
.
I
found
this
code
much
simpler

do
not
known
how

load

I
want

read
all

was
able

.
But
I
have
been
unsuccessful

I
have
this

the
bootstrap
","
Here
is
my

I
got
2
lists

plot
a
time
series
graph

wrote
a
code
to
plot
a
graph

these
two
lists
","
which
is
as
follows
:
I
added
this
set
of
codes
to
plot
the
average
of
the
values

list
r1
i.e
:
but
the
code
started
throwing
an

Thanks
for

.
r1
is
a
list

actual
floats

ints
so
obviously
you
cannot
divide
a
string

a

you
need

convert
the

floats

you
pass
it

change
does
work

using
sum

be
a

The

pickle

collect

I
need

pickle
this

I
can't
find
the
right
way

do
it

Just
to
clarify
things
","
imagine
I
have
classes
that
represent
square
","
rectangle
and
circle
.
I
create
some
instances
:
I
can
pickle
the
list

I
need
a
way
to
pickle
this
array

the
class
instances
properties
keeping
the
reference
to
the
original
objects
so
that
if
one
object
changes
the
relative
property
changes
:
imagine
I
call
C.grow(2)
I
expect
to
have
dimensions
[2]
=
12
.
To
solve
the
problem
I
now
pickle
this
dictionary
:
but
I
think
this
is
a
very
poor
solution
.
I
appreciate
any
suggestion
.
If
the
issue
is
that
your
class
methods
are
not
able
to
be
pickled

you
might
try
dill

It
typically
can
pickle

instance
methods

The
only
way
to
keep
the
original
reference
of
the
objects
if
you
have
things
like
A.side
which
is
an
int
is
to
either
keep
it
in
a
list
or
a
class
of
it's
own
.
For
example
","
you
can
do
this
:
Now
","
you
can
make
Square
","
Rectangle
and
Circle
such
that
they
use
the
class
Value
for
each
of
their
variables
.
and
then
use
it
in
dimensions
like
dimensions
=
[
A.side
","
...
]
Note
","
now
that
A.side
is
a
class
-
the
value
cannot
be
seen
using
print(A.side)
but
can
be
seen
using
print(A.side.value)
I
came
out
with
this
solution
:
I
don't
think
this
is
the
ideal
solution
but
","
at
least
","
with
it
I
don't
have
to
change
the
other
classes

Circle
in
the
example

Answering

If
you
want

run

you
need

also
install

is
not
installed
along

scrapy

This
is
mentioned

You
can
install
it
using
sudo

an

args

it

been
changed

The
application

being
served
with

ideas

what
the
issue

a

why

Im

you
simple
do

the

way

You

The
way
you

by
reading

a

capitalizing
it
(
with
upper()

","
and
stripping
all
whitespace
.
Therefore
","
something
like
'
aaa-mc
'
is
being
converted
to
'
AAA-MC
'
.
You're
later
splitting
this
uppercase
string
on
the
token
'
-
mc
'
","
which
is
impossible
for
it
to
contain
","
so
.
I'd
reccommed
either
replacing
upper()
with
lower()
when
you
are
reading
your
string
in
","
or
doing
a
hard
replace
on
the
types
of
'
-
mc

using

effectively
jumping

to
create
a
ToolBarToolBase
object
without
adding
it
visibly
to
the
toolbar
.
I've
tried
instantiating
ToolBarToolBase
","
but
I'm
using
wxPython
version
2.8.12.1
(
I
can't
upgrade
","
I'm
doing
this
for
work
)
so
I
don't
think
it's
fully
implemented
.
Is
there
any
way
to
do
this
?
I
need
to
generate
1MB
image
file
to
do
a
teste
on
django
.
I
can
only
set
the
image
size
","
but
not
the
image
file
size
.
The
simplest
way
is
to
save
a
BMP
image
","
which
has
no
compression
:
And
if
you
need
to
use
PNG
","
you
can
fill
it
with
random
data
:
File
size
depends
on
what
is
on
the
picture
.
PNG
compresses
the
data
","
so
the
blank
image
would
be
way
smaller
than
a
photo
(
with
the
same
resolution
)
.
You
may
use
an
iterative
approach
:
filp
one
pixel
","
save
to
file
","
check
size
.
Then
flip
another
one
.
Faster
:
use
bisection
.
i
think
i
got
what
you
want
.
i
just
moved
the
if
statement
of
the
used
letters
to
the
top
of
your
while
","
and
instead
of
appending
to
the
lettersguessed
the
guess
variable
","
i
appended
the
userinput
variable
.
So
I
am
new
to
coding
and
as
part
of
my
course
I
am
making
a
hangman

I
have
a
queue

.
This
code
is
ugly
.
I
do
not
see
how

improve
it

I
read
some
time

how

make

Is
there
a
better
(
=
more
elegant

pythonic
)
way
to
solve
the
problem
?
You
could
use
iter
twice
:
"iter(q.get, 'END')"
returns
an
iterator

can
iterate
over
the
values
in
the
queue
until
'
END
'
is
returned
by
q.get()
.
Then
you
could
use
the
grouper
recipe
to
group
the
iterator
into
chunks
of
10
items
.
yields
You
have
tabs

not
spaces
","
in
your
DNS
file

Try
this
:
python
2.7.3

I'm
sure
I'm
missing
something
simple

The

indeed
return

URIs

There's
a
different
REST

The

the

I

The
list

come
from
a
REST
query

I
am
successfully
calling
the
Artifactory

3.2.2
)

These
properties

added

I

The

quite

walking
thru

I
discover

I
suspect
that's

Sheesh

It
sure

like
I
should
be
able

get
a
proper
browser
URL

a
REST

.
Example
URL
:
""""
"http://ourserver.org:8081/artifactory/api/storage/our-releases/com/companyname/Training/1.7.4/Training.ipa"""
It's
easy

replace
""""
/
api
/
storage
""""
with
""""

simple
""""

that

that

the

work
in
a

I
just
think
it's
an
ugly
solution

I
mostly
think
I'm
missing
something

As
explained

the
Artifactory

optional

In

I
have
a
legacy
code
segment

always
encode('utf-8')

me

I
pass
in
an
unicode
string

directly
from
database
)
","
is
there
a
way
to
change
unicode
string

other
format

allow
it

be
encoded

'
utf-8

getting
an

","
since
I
am
not
allowed

code
segment

I've
tried
decoding
it
first
but
it
returns
this
error
If
I
leave
the
unicode
string

is
it
returns

I
change
the
legacy
code

works
","
but
this
is
not
a
viable
option
Edit
:
Here
is
the
code
snippet
For
some
reason
if
I
skip
#

I
don't
get
the
error
that
I
mentioned
above
","
I
double
check
the
type

it
seems
like
both

unicode
","
and
both
is
the
same

","
but
the
code
I
am
working
on
does
not
allow
me
to
encode
or
decode
to
utf-8
","
while
the
same
character
in
some
snippet
allows
me
to
do
that
.
In
order
for
encode('utf-8')
to
make
sense
","
the
string
must
be
a
unicode
string
(

contain
all-ASCII
characters
...
)
.
So
","
unless
it's
a
unicode
instance
already
","
you
have
to
decode
it
first
from
whatever
encoding
it's
in

a
unicode
string
","
after
which
you
can
pass
it

your
legacy

At
no
point
does
it
make
sense
for
anything
to
be
double-encoded
-
-
encoding
takes
a
string
and
transforms
it
to
a
series
of
bytes
;
decoding
takes
a
series
of
bytes
and
transforms
them
back
into
a
string

The
confusion
only
arises
because
Python
2
uses
the
str
for
both
plain-ASCII
strings

byte
sequences

you
issue

Several

I
post
another
question

cassandra
was
complaining
about
TimeOut
issue

I
was
using

Can
anyone
help

is
this
my

If
your
question
is
about
those
errors
at
the
top
","
those
are
server-side
error
responses
.
The
first
says
that
the
coordinator
you
contacted
cannot
satisfy
the
request
at
CL.ONE
","
with
the
nodes
it
believes
are
alive
.
This
can
happen
if
all
replicas
are
down
(
more
likely
with
a
low
replication
factor
)
.
The
other
two
errors
are
timeouts
","
where
the
coordinator
didn't
get
responses
from
'
live
'
nodes
in
a
time
configured
in
the
cassandra.yaml
.
All
of
these
indicate
that
the
cluster
you're
connected
to
is
not
healthy
.
This
could
be
because
it
is
overwhelmed
(
high
GC
pauses
)
","
or
experiencing
network
issues
.
Check
the
server
logs
for
clues
.
Finally
I
have
found
buggy

I
think
I
may
have
a
solution
thanks
to
some
tips
from
Maxwell
Grady
.
I
changed
the
following
2
lines
:
Note

Now
that

can

to
make
it
less

I
fuzzy
matched

compiled
them

with

I
want
to
add
up
the
match
values
for
each
title
so
that
I
get
output
like
this
:
I
have
tried
several
implementations
utilizing

it's
ugly

(
Not
my
exact
code
but
this
is
the
ugliness
)
:
what
is
a
more
efficient
way
to
accomplish
this
?
You
can
use
a
dict
to
store
the
results
you
want
","
and
then
at
the
end
if
you
want
a
list
of
tuples
","
you
can
use
dict.items()
(
Python
3.x
)
to
get
that
.
Example
-
You
do
not
need
list(...)
at
the
end
if
you
are
using
Python
2.x
.
pyspark
relies
on
the
spark
SDK
.
You
need
to
have
that
installed
before
using
pyspark
.
Once
that's
set
you
need
to
set
the
environment
variable
SPARK_HOME
to
tell
pyspark
where
to
look
for
your
spark
installation
.
If
you're
on
a
*
nix
system
you
can
do
so
by
adding
the
follow
to
your
.
bashrc
If
you're
using
Windows
there's
a
convoluted
way
of
setting
variables
via
GUI
here

Through
DOS
you
can
use

What
is
the
solution
?
I
need
to
be
able
to
determine
(
or
predict
)
when
a
unicode
character
won't
be
printable
.
For
instance
","
if
I
print
this
unicode
character
under
default
settings
","
it
prints
fine
:
But
if
I
print
another
unicode
character
","
it
prints
as
a
stupid
","
weird
square
:
I
really
need
to
be
able
to
determine
before
a
character
is
printed
if
it
will
display
like
this
as
an
ugly
square
(
or
sometimes
as
an
anonymous
blank
)
.
What
causes
this
","
and
how
can
I
predict
it
?
While
it's
not
very
easy
to
tell
if
the
terminal
running
your
script
(
or
the
font
your
terminal
is
using
)
is
able
to
render
a
given
character
correctly
","
you
can
at
least
check
that
the
character
actually
has
a
representation
.
The
character
\
ua62b
is
defined
as
VAI
SYLLABLE
NDOLE
DO
","
whereas
the
character
\
ua62c
has
no
definition
","
hence
why
it
may
be
rendered
as
a
square
or
other
generic
symbol
.
One
way
to
check
if
a
character
is
defined
is
to
use
the
unicodedata
module
:
As
you
can
see
above
","
a
ValueError
is
raised
for
the
\
ua62c
character
because
it
isn't
defined
.
Another
method
is
to
check
the
category
of
the
character
.
If
it
is
Cn
then
the
character
is
not
assigned
:
It
seems
that
my
issue
was
using
multiple
zmq
contexts
over
different
processes
.
While
the
PyZMQ
documentation
states
that
the
zmq
context
is
thread-safe
","
I
can
only
assume
it
meant
Python
threads
rather
than
processes
.
This
is
quite
confusing
as
in
C
","
zmq
contexts
are
thread
safe
despite
running
in
a
way
similar
to
the
Python
multiprocessing.Process
.
The
issue
was
solved
by
creating
a
zmq
context
for
each
Process
.
I
am
working
with
PyZMQ
and
I
have
what
seems
to
be
a
rather
peculiar
issue
.
I
have
two
classes
that
are
wrapping
sockets
for
communication
","
MZLSubscriber
and
MZLRequester
.
There
is
a
class
that
contains
both
of
them
","
MZLLink
.
For
each
of
these
","
I
also
have
tests
MZLSubscriberTest
","
MZLRequesterTest
","
and
MZLinkTest
.
The
tests
for
the
subscriber
and
requester
work
as
they
should
","
but
MZLinkTest
does
not
receive
any
subscriber
messages
.
Below
is
what
seems
to
be
the
relative
code
","
which
are
the
constructors
for
the
3
classes
as
well
as
run()
for
MZLSubscriber
and
the
tests
for
MZLink
and
MZLSubscriber
.
MZLink
Constructor
:

Test
:
MZLRequester

:
MZLSubscriber.run()
:

Test
:
The
subscriber
thread
seems
to
block
at
datum
=
self.socket.recv()
","
which
makes
me
think
it
could
be
some
issue
with
the
socket
creation
.
However
","
it
does
seem
to
work
when
only
working
with
the
subscriber
.
The
requester
seems
to
work
in
both
cases
.
In
addition
","
everything
goes
smoothly
by
just
commenting
out
the
two
lines
dealing
with
requester
.
I
apologize
for
the
wall
of
code
","
but
I
can't
even
narrow
what
code
the
issue
is
coming
from
at
this
point
.
When
I
do
","
I'll
remove
the
irrelevant
code
.
The
test
code
that
deals
with
the
incoming
data
has
been
removed
.
As
a
bit
of
clarification
","
I
am
using
Python
2.7
with
PyZMQ
14.3.1
.
UPDATE
:
It
seems
that
running
MZLSubscriber
in
the
main
thread
rather
than
creating
another
Process
results
in
the
expected
result
","
so
it
seems
that
this
could
be
some
sort
of
thread
safety
.
To
my
knowledge
","
zmq
contexts
are
thread-safe
","
but
sockets
are
not
.
I
thought
this
wouldn't
cause
an
issue
because
I'm
explicitly
making
sure
there
is
a
socket
for
each
thread
.
UPDATE
2
:
If
the
calls
setting
up
the
socket
in
MZLSubscriber
are
moved
from
run()
to
__init__
","
the
socket
seems
to
receive
a
small
portion
of
the
published
message
","
but
does
have
an
error
:
I
have
gotten
a
workaround
to
this
by
creating
a
new
zmq.Context
in
MZLSubscriber.run()
","
although
I
feel
that
this
shouldn't
be
necessary
if
zmq
contexts
are
thread-safe
.
You
should
split
your
question
into
two
","
however
","
for
the
first
question
","
the
exception
is
raised
because
there
is
no
JOB_ID
environment
variable
set
in
your
Python
program's
environment
.
Firstly
you
can
set
it
on
the
command
line
when
invoking
Python
:
or
you
can
set
the
variable
in
you
shell's
environment
:
Either
of
these
will
fix
the
problem
","
however
","
you
should
code
more
defensively
by
catching
the
exception
","
or
by
using
os.environ.get('JOB_ID')
which
will
not
throw
an
exception
if
the
environment
variable
is
not
set
.
For
the
second
question
you
should
reask
it
as
new
question
and
in
it
explain
more
accurately
which
module
is
being
used
.
First
question
:
I
have
a
python
program
and
after
I
run
it
","
I
get
the
following
error
:
Is
it
because
I
did
not
initialize
the
environmental
variables
in
the
command
line
prompt
?
The
UserDict
is
involved
with
a
dictionary
","
right
?
Second
question
:
How
to
quickly
grasp
the
main
initialization
of
a
simulation
in
python
?
For
example
","
suppose
I
have
the
following
code

How
to
understand
this
then
?
I
am
relatively
new
to
python
.
Many
thanks
for
your
time
and
attention
.
Its
better
to
use
os.getenv('JOB_ID')
instead
of
os.environ
[
'
JOB_ID
'
]
.
Tell
me
how
are
you
setting
the
environment
variable
from
the
command-line
?
For
ex
.
:
you
could
do
this
:
You're
getting
a
parser
error
due
to
invalid
syntax

In
Python
you
don't
specify

types

be
From
the
Jython
docs

extension
)

a
destination

In
theory
","
this
problem
is
simple
enough
to
solve
in
Python
with
the
os.walk()

os.rename()

The
complication

that
the
file

larger

Current
way

An
alternate
solution
is
to
create
a

inherits

add
a

is
what
I
am
hoping

achieve

Thanks
in

!
!
It's
fairly
easy
to
create
a
series
of
buttons
and
bind
them
to
the
same
handler
.
I
wrote
on
this
topic
a
few
years
ago
here
.
Using
that
example
","
I
created
something
simple
using
your
example
:
You
will
probably
want
to
change
it
up
slightly
so
that
the
value
of
the
quote
dictionary
is
another
data
structure
that
contains
the
label
of
the
button
and
the
quote
instead
of
using
the
same
string
for
the
button's
label
and
its
name
.
I'm
creating
a
wxPython
App
which
lists
rows
of
buttons
.
When
the
buttons
are
pressed
","
a
pop-up
message
(
which
will
be
a
quote
)
is
displayed
.
I'm
having
trouble
programming
the
buttons
to
display
a
pop
up
message
.

I'm
having
trouble
having
a
pop
up
message
displayed
after
wx.ToggleButton
is
clicked
.
2
)
The
other
problem
is
how
I
can
make
multiple
buttons
which
will
each
display
a
different
message
The
callback
can
send
data
to
a
coroutine
which
can
send
it
along
again
if
needed
.
Not
sure
if
this
is
what
you
are
looking
for
but
your
question
made
me
think
of
coroutines
.
If
the
callback
execution
is
asynchronous
","
I'm
not
sure
what
would
happen
if
the
coroutine
wasn't
back
to
the
first
yield
and
the
callback
tries
to
send
it
something
","
it
might
throw
a
ValueError
:
generator
already
executing
exception
.
I
am
looking
for
a
way
to
get
stuff
from
a
callback
into
a
generator
","
or
the
generator
to
inherit
the
callback
.
When
the
callback
is
called
","
the
generator
should
run
","
yielding
the
data
.
While
I
normally
would
use
a
queue
and
a
thread
to
run
and
get
that
callback
","
in
this
case
I
am
running
inside
a
python
extension
of
an
cli
which
calls
my_callback(data)
.
As
a
result
","
I
can't
use
threading
","
as
python
will
only
execute
that
callback
.
Afterwards
the
C
part
of
the
cli
will
do
stuff
again
","
and
python
is
not
executed
.
Edit
:
I
could
register
a
'
poll
'
function
","
which
will
get
called
periodically
.
Putting
a
wait
in
there
give
at
least
the
thread-queue
construction
some
time
to
execute
.
But
that
feels
to
dirty
for
actual
code
.
You
could
use
the
split
command
.
For
ex
","
:
-
If
you
want
to
do

a

""""

right
now
.
I
want
to
split
it
up
into
50kb
text
files
.
I
would
use
a
loop
if
I
could
readlines()
the
file
","
but
since
it's
one
long
string
","
I'm
not
sure
i
could
do
that
.
Open
the
file
","
set
up
a
byte
range
to
iterate
through
","
then
seek()
to
that
location

in
the
content

and
","
if
there
was
content

write
it
to
a
new
file
.
If
there's
no

break

the

You'll
have
to
write
this
code
another

The
reason
you're
getting
infinite

because
you're
telling
Python

store
the
result

the
recursive
call

the
dictionary

This
means
it
recurses
unconditionally

since
you
always
build
the
dictionary
before
doing
the
lookup
.
One
way
to
solve
this
would
be
to
store
lambda
functions
in
the
dictionary
","
and
then
only
call
the
one
you
get

In
this
version

the
recursive

only
made

the
appropriate

","
that's

I'd
bother

have
three

I'd
just
use
a
series

even
though
that
might
not
be
as
efficient

a

specific
width

get

You
can
add
some
flair
:
You'll
most
likely
have
to
play
around

the
width

ensure
your
strings
are
centered

In
:
is
the
standard
ipython
prompt

is
ipython's
way

telling
you

it

waiting

just
like

YAML
file
is
the
line
which
has
a
different
indentation
(
i.e.
is
outdented
)
compared
to
the
lines
before
and
after
.
Up
until
LFSDetails
the
YAML
file
looks
like
it
has
a
mapping
at
the
top
level
.
So
the
intial
solution
might
be
to
just
push
LFSDetails
in
with
two
spaces
to
align
it
with
that
.
That
would
result
in
an
empty
string
as
its
literal
block
scalar
(
introduced
with
|
and
your
code
seems
to
rely
on
YAML
as
text
block
within
YAML
.
So
it
looks
like
the
indentation
following
all
of
the
lines
following
LFSDetails
is
correct
.
For
your
error
message
to
appear
your
YAML
file
has
to
start
with
a
dash
(
sequence
indicator
)
indented
3
spaces
:
gives
this
error
(
I
stripped
out
the
irrelevant
intermediate
mapping
entries
)
.
This
however
parses
","
but
completely
drops
anything
after
the
outdentation
by
LFSDetails
ยน
:
gives
you
:
Because
of
the
dash
the
mapping
starting
with
Version
:
is
the
first
element
of
a
sequence
/
list
and
after
that
trying
to
access
a
list
element
with
a
string
(
LFSDetails
)
gets
you
the
error
.
You
should
therefore
first
clean
up
your
YAML
to
make
it
correct
.
I
also
suggest
to
include
the
start
of
document
marker
(
-
-
-
)
even
if
you
only
have
one
document
in
the
example
file
","
since
you
are
using
load_all()
.
And
get
rid
of
the
extra
indentation
(
i.e.
have
things
start
in
the
first
column
of
the
line
)
.
After
removing
any
spurious
sequence
starting
dashes
and
get
something
like
this
:
which
gets
you
as
output
:

This
was
done
using
ruamel.yaml

I

the

want

calling
this

later

.
I
think
I'm
missing
something
basic
here
regarding
the
data
structure

the
way
the
yaml.load_all

What
am
I
missing

I
presume
you

using
PyYaml

load_all
is
for
loading
multiple
YAML
documents
in
a
single
file

and
so
always
returns
a
list
.
You
just
have
a

what's

How

The
way

to

the
methodology
.
To
fix
your
specific
issue
","
you
can
do
something
like
this
:

you

call
the

feel

I
see
a
few
things
that
could
be
changed

this

I
would
also
recommend
using
slugs
-
example
this
app
is
great
(
django-autoslug-field
)
.
One
approach
for
this
would
be
:
This
would
give
you
the
flexibility
to
analyze
which
apps
are
in
an
environment
","
and
at
the
same
time
","
what
environments
does
an
app
belong
to

Your
template
would
be
Also
","
now
you
can
process
the
url
by
slug

which
would
eliminate
all
the

I
need
some
help
mapping
views
in
Django

My

pretty
simple

it's
just
a
status
page
listing
all
of
our
environments
and
their
corresponding
apps
.
So
far
I
have
all
the

listed

so
:
But
what
I
want

my

Well
","
I
figured
it
out
.
Turns
out
that
the
metafunc.parametrize
function
accepts
""""
ids
""""
as
a
parameter
.
All
I
had
to
do
was
define
the
__repr__

the

was
looking

name

expanded
the

essentially
running

my
conftest.py

I
stole
this
from
the
pytest
documentation

:
My
test
cases

placed

look

instantiate
them
something

this
:

I
make
a
list

them

this
:
I
store
the
target
environment
in
a
config
file
that
is
an
instantiation
of
an
object
like
this
:
Then
I
have
a
test
class
that
creates
a
list
of
test
cases
like
this
-
the
test
object
parameters
are
actually
strings
that
allow
for
self
generating
code
.
I'm
oversimplifying
as
I
pass
them
in
as
fill
ins
to
broader
exec
statements
:
When
the
collector
runs

If

There's

Here's
a
""""

way

quickly
show

Pyplot

a
menu
where
you
can
edit
line
properties

change
the
color

style
","
but
its
rather
clunky
when
you
want

hide
lines

isolate
the

Ideally
","
I'd

Similar

I'm
not
sure

this

so
I
am
open

other

they're
somewhat
easy

distribute

If
you're
splitting

whitespace
","
just
use
split()

There's
nothing
to
be
gained
by
reading
each
line
and
stripping
it
","
because
split()
already
handles
all
that
.
So
to
get
the
initial
list

words

all
you
need
is
this

convert

finally
sort
it

all
be
simplified
to
three
lines
","
like
so
:
(
NB
:
the
with
statement
will
automatically
close
the
file
for
you
)
Some
thoughts
:
Consider
using
a
set
for
the
words
.
Adding
another
word
only
really
adds
it
when
its
not
in
there
already
.
Open
the
file
with
'
r
'
to
indicate
read-only
mode
.
Sorting
is
really
easy
(
also
for
sets
)
","
just
use
sorted()
.
Something
like
this
works
:
Inside
the
for
loop
for
for
word
in
words
:
when
you
do
-
lst.append(words)
-
it
appends
the
whole
words
list
into
lst
","
I
believe
you
intended
to
use
-
lst.append(word)
.
Also
","
the
for
loop
-
for
word
in
words
:
should
be
indented
inside
for
line
in
openedfile
:
","
so
that
you
run
the
loop
for
each
line
.
And
lastly
","
if
you
want
to
lexicographically
sort
the
words
","
you
should
call
-
lst.sort()
at
the
end
.
Also
","
it
would
be
better
to
use
with
statement
to
open
the
file
","
so
that
it
can
handle
closing
the
file
after
everything
is
finish
automatically
.
Also
","
it
may
be
easier
to
use
set()
as
the
initial
data
type
to
store
the
elements
as
the
not
in
operator
for
list
is
O(n)
","
and
as
the
list
gets
bigger
","
that
would
take
more
time
.
Whereas
with
a
set
data
type
","
you
do
not
need
to
worry
about
checking
if
the
set
already
has
the
word
","
since
set
does
not
allow
duplicates
.
At
the
end
","
you
can
use
list(..)
to
convert
the
set
back
to
list
and
then
sort
it
.
Example
-
First
","
I
think
you
want
lst.append(word)
to
only
append
a
word
if
not
in
the
list
already
.
You
have
lst.append(words)
.
That
is
wrong
.
Second
","
to
sort
just
use
lst.sort()
I'm
trying
to
read
lines
in
a
file
","
split
the
lines
into
words
","
and
add
the
individual
words
to
a
list
if
they
are
not
already
in
the
list
.
Lastly
","
the
words
have
to
be
sorted
.
I've
been
trying
to
get
this
right
for
a
while
","
and
I
understand
the
concepts
","
but
I'm
not
sure
how
to
get
the
exact
language
and
placement
right
.
Here's
what
I
have
:
So
","
as
far
as
I
understand
","
the
ManyToManyField
in
the
Section
class
doesn't
actually
save
any
DocumentType
data
in
the
Section
database
table
","
rather
it
saves
the
relationship
to
DocumentType
.
Therefore
if
I
want
to
access
the
document_type
of
a
section
I
have
to
look
up
the
Section
objects
via
the
DocumentType
object
","
and
vice
versa
.
For
instance
:
or
:
or
:
Although
this
:
raises
ValueError
:
invalid
literal
for
int()
with
base
10
:
'
WAN
'
because
there
is
no
data
under
the
section_document_type
m2m
field
","
only
the
relationship
.
So
this
is
still
the
case
:
Further
info
here
.
models.py
When
I
create
a
Section
in
the
Admin
it
doesn't
appear
to
save
the
document_type_s
.
In
the
django
shell
I
can
see
that
DocumentType
is
saving
properly
:
When
I
check
the
Sections
I
get
:
And
when
I
check
Documents
:
And
if
I
try
to
create
a
new
section
:
Django
appears
to
have
created
the
field
in
the
database
","
looking
at
my
migrations
file
:
I
don't
know
what
is
causing
this
?
How
do
you
think
this
is
going
to
work
?
document_type_s
is
a
ManyToMany
field
but
you
are
passing
in
a
string
value
Read
the
docs
for
ManyToMany
:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/examples/many_to_many/
For
many
to
many
relation
to
be
created
the
Section
instance
already
has
to
exist
(
because
in
the
db
a
m2m
relation
is
an
extra
table
with
two
foreign
keys
)
...
so
you
need
to
:
The
problem
you
have
is
not
that
Python
thinks
that
debian
/
control
does
not
exist
","
but
rather
that
it
seems
like
deb_pkg_tools.control
does
not
exist
.
I
would
use
the
python-debian
package
from
Debian
to
parse
the
control
file
if
I
were
you
.
Here
is
the
code
that
will
parse
the
control
file
to
get
the
dependencies
.
It
should
work
even
for
packages
with
multiple
binary
packages
.
Each
item
in
the
above
example
is
a
tuple
that
pairs
the
""""
key
""""
with
the
""""
value
""""
","
so
item
[0]
gives
us
the
""""
key
""""
and
item
[1]
gives
us
the
""""
value
""""
.
Obviously
the
above
sample
just
prints
out
the
dependencies
as
they
are
in
the
control
file
","
so
the
dependencies
aren't
in
a
format
that
is
suitable
to
directly
plug
into
apt-get
install
.
Also
","
by
parsing
the
control
file
","
I
got
stuff
like
${python:Depends
}
in
addition
to
actual
package
names
","
so
that
is
something
you
will
have
to
consider
.
Here
is
an
example
of
the
output
I
got
from
the
above
example
:
I
found
this
bug
report

the

I've
just
thought
of
a
way
to
solve
this
-
by
combining
my
two
methods
:
First
","
focus
on
the
individual
chromosomes
","
and
then
loop
through
the
genes
in
these
smaller
dataframes
.
This
also
doesn't
have
to
make
use
of
any
SQL
queries
either
.
I've
also
included
a
section
to
immediately
identify
any
redundant
genes
that
don't
have
any
SNPs
that
fall
within
their
range
.
This
makes
use
of
a
double
for-loop
which
I
normally
try
to
avoid
-
but
in
this
case
it
works
quite
well
.
While
this
doesn't
run
spectacularly
quickly
-
it
does
run
so
that
I
can
actually
get
some
answers
.
I'd
still
like
to
know
if
anyone
has
any
tips
to
make
it
run
more
efficiently
though
.
Firstly
","
sorry
if
this
is
a
bit
lengthy
","
but
I
wanted
to
fully
describe
what
I
have
having
problems
with
and
what
I
have
tried
already
.
I
am
trying
to
join
(
merge
)
together
two
dataframe
objects
on
multiple
conditions
.
I
know
how
to
do
this
if
the
conditions
to
be
met
are
all
'
equals
'
operators
","
however
","
I
need
to
make
use
of
LESS
THAN
and
MORE
THAN
.
The
dataframes
represent
genetic
information
:
one
is
a
list
of
mutations
in
the
genome
(
referred
to
as
SNPs
)
and
the
other
provides
information
on
the
locations
of
the
genes
on
the
human
genome
.
Performing
df.head()
on
these
returns
the
following
:
SNP
DataFrame
(
snp_df
)
:
This
shows
the
SNP
reference
ID
and
their
locations
.
'
BP
'
stands
for
the
'
Base-Pair
'
position
.
Gene
DataFrame
(
gene_df
)
:
This
dataframe
shows
the
locations
of
all
the
genes
of
interest
.
What
I
want
to
find
out
is
all
of
the
SNPs
which
fall
within
the
gene
regions
in
the
genome
","
and
discard
those
that
are
outside
of
these
regions
.
If
I
wanted
to
merge
together
two
dataframes
based
on
multiple
(
equals
)
conditions
","
I
would
do
something
like
the
following
:
However
","
in
this
instance
-
I
need
to
find
the
SNPs
where
the
chromosome
values
match
those
in
the
Gene
dataframe
","
and
the
BP
value
falls
between
'
chr_start
'
and
'
chr_stop
'
.
What
makes
this
challenging
is
that
these
dataframes
are
quite
large
.
In
this
current
dataset
the
snp_df
has
6795021
rows
","
and
the
gene_df
has
34362
.
I
have
tried
to
tackle
this
by
either
looking
at
chromosomes
or
genes
seperately
.
There
are
22
different
chromosome
values
(
ints
1-22
)
as
the
sex
chromosomes
are
not
used
.
Both
methods
are
taking
an
extremely
long
time
.
One
uses
the
pandasql
module
","
while
the
other
approach
is
to
loop
through
the
separate
genes
.

anyone
give

a

way

doing
this

can
use
the
following
to
accomplish
what
you're
looking
for
:
Note
:
your
example
dataframes
do
not
meet
your
join
criteria
.
Here
is
an
example
using
modified
dataframes
:
Double
check
that
you're
not
mixing
spaces
and
tabs
.
Python
thinks
the
second
for
loop
is
indented
to
the
same
level
as
the
print
statement
above
it
.
Thank
you
@Kevin
","
I
had
spaces
for
the
first
loops
","
and
indents
for
the
second
;
didn't
realize
python
differentiated
these
.
I'm
doing
some
experimenting
with
Python
args
and
kwargs
and
ran
into
an
unexpected
issue
.
My
code
is
:
The
output
is
:
If
the
args
and
kwargs
loops
are
separate
","
I
would
expect
to
see
:
Why
is
python
behaving
this
way
?
It
looks
like
it's
running
one
iteration
at
a
time
from
each
loop
","
instead
of
all
iterations
from
each
loop
before
moving
to
the
next
.
So
while
Jianxun's
answer
is
probably
completely
correct
","
it
won't
work
on
my
system
.
I
am
on
Pandas
.
17
and
the
newest
matplotlib
.
I'm
also
on
a
Macbook
.
Basically
if
I
try
to
share
an
X
axis
with
two
graphs
","
a
line
and
bar
graph
","
the
first
instantiated
graph
disappears
.
The
best
way
I
can
think
to
fix
this
is
simply
by
doing
two
graphs
on
one
(
subplots
)
and
hiding
the
X
axis
of
the
top
graph
.
Here's
what
I
did
:
I
often
see
this
in
the
context
of
matplotlib
and
open-high-low-close
","
but
I'm
wondering
if
you
can
add
a
volume
overlay
within
the
pandas
framework
.
The
final
graph
we
would
want
would
be
close
to
the
first
one
here
:
(
Matplotlib
-
Finance
volume
overlay
)
Say
we
have
a
DataFrame
like
such
:
How
can
we
get
the
[
'
num
'
","
'
rolling_30
'
","
'
rolling_10
'
","
'
rolling_60
'
]
line
chart
with
the
bottom
of
the
chart
listing
the
daily
volume
?
I
can
do
a
secondary_y
to
get
volume
on
the
right
","
but
honestly
that
looks
terrible
.
Need
it
to
be
the
traditional
volume
bar-graph
at
the
bottom
of
the
chart
.
The
basic
idea
is
to
use
.
twinx
to
create
a
secondary
y
axis
.
Below
is
a
short
sample
to
do
it
.
From
the
graph
","
you
see
that
the
left
y
axis
is
for
price
and
moving
averages
","
whereas
the
right
y
axis
is
for
volumn
.
If
you
are
using
Python
3.x
","
then
to
reload
the
names
that
have
been
imported
using
from
module
import name
","
you
would
need
to
do
-
For
Python
2.x
","
you
can
simply
do
-
I
have
a
script
that
computes
some
stuff
.
It
uses
inputs
from
a
separate
file
'
inputs.py
'
.
In
'
inputs.py
'
are
only
a
few
variables
:
In
the
main
file
I
import them
with
If
I
now
change
something
in
'
inputs.py
'
and
execute
the
script
again
it
still
uses
the
old
values
instead
of
the
new
ones
.
How
can
I
reload
the
file
?
does
not
work
.
Many
thanks
in
advance
!
Let's
quote
docs
:
reload(module)
Reload
a
previously
imported
module
.
The
argument
must
be
a
module
object
","
so
it
must
have
been
successfully
imported
before
.
This
is
useful
if
you
have
edited
the
module
source
file
using
an
external
editor
and
want
to
try
out
the
new
version
without
leaving
the
Python
interpreter
.
The
return
value
is
the
module
object
(
the
same
as
the
module
argument
)
.
The
argument
must
be
a
module
object
","
so
it
must
have
been
successfully
imported
before
.
When
you
do
from
inputs
import
*
you
actually
has
no
module
object
in
your
namespace
.
Only
module
members
.
When
reload(module)
is
executed
:
Python
modules
’
code
is
recompiled
and
the
module-level
code
reexecuted
","
defining
a
new
set
of
objects
which
are
bound
to
names
in
the
module’s
dictionary
.
The
init
function
of
extension
modules
is
not
called
a
second
time
.
As
with
all
other
objects
in
Python
the
old
objects
are
only
reclaimed
after
their
reference
counts
drop
to
zero
.
The
names
in
the
module
namespace
are
updated
to
point
to
any
new
or
changed
objects
.
Other
references
to
the
old
objects
(
such
as
names
external
to
the
module
)
are
not
rebound
to
refer
to
the
new
objects
and
must
be
updated
in
each
namespace
where
they
occur
if
that
is
desired
.
Other
references
to
the
old
objects
(
such
as
names
external
to
the
module
)
are
not
rebound
to
refer
to
the
new
objects
and
must
be
updated
in
each
namespace
where
they
occur
if
that
is
desired
.
You
star-imported
A
","
B
and
C
are
precisely
other
references
.
To
sum
up
","
an
example
code
would
be
:
does
something
like
this
pseudo
code
:
The
module
inputs
is
cached
in
sys.modules
.
If
you
do
a
reload(inputs)
","
the
cached
module
is
reloaded
","
but
the
assignment
process
which
loads
the
data
from
the
imported
module
to
the
local
name
space
is
not
repeated
.
You
have
to
do
so
by
hand
","
as
the
other
answer
already
states
.
You
could
try
using
a
class
property
of
type
bool
Above
your
init
method
","
you
could
define
a
property
like
this
:
bool
stopFlag
=
False
Then
inside
your
for
loop
","
add
an
if(!self.stopFlag)
:
break
.
This
will
check
the
stopFlag
every
iteration
","
and
negate
it
.
So
it
will
default
to
passing
the
if
check
at
first
.
Then
inside
your
stop
method
","
just
set
your
self.stopFlag
=
True
So
when
stop
is
called
","
it
will
flip
the
flag
","
and
if
the
start
method
is
running
in
it's
for
loop
","
it
will
catch
this
change
in
the
flag
and
break
out
.

With
Tkinter

such

You
should
generally
not
use
time.sleep()

it

I
was
wondering
if
there
is
an
easy
way
to
create
a
grid
of
checkboxes
using
Tkinter
.
I
am
trying
to
make
a
grid
of
10
rows
and
columns
(
so
100
checkboxes
)
so
that
only
two
checkboxes
can
be
selected
per
row
.
Edit
:
I'm
using
python
2.7
with
spyder
What
I
have
so
far
:
I'm
trying
to
use
state='Disabled
'
to
grey
out
a
row
once
two
checkboxes
have
been
selected
.
Here's
an
example
using
your
provided
10x10
grid
.
It
should
give
you
the
basic
idea
of
how
to
implement
this
.
Just
make
sure
you
keep
a
reference
to
every
Checkbutton
(
boxes
in
the
example
)
as
well
as
every
IntVar
(
boxVars
in
the
example
)
.
Here's
why
:
-
Checkbuttons
are
needed
to
call
config(state = DISABLED/NORMAL)
.
-
IntVars
are
needed
to
determine
the
value
of
each
Checkbutton
.
Aside
from
those
crucial
elements
its
basically
just
some
2D
array
processing
.
Here's
my
example
code
(
now
based
off
of
your
provided
code
)
.
Here's
a
version
that
puts
everything
into
a
class
so
we
don't
need
to
use
global
variables
.
It
also
avoids
the
import
*
construction
which
is
generally
considered
bad
style
in
Python
.
True
","
lots
of
example
code
uses
import
*
but
it's
not
a
good
practice
because
it
clutters
up
the
global
namespace
with
all
the
names
from
the
imported
module
.
So
those
names
can
clash
with
the
names
of
your
own
variables
","
and
they
can
also
clash
with
the
names
of
other
modules
you
import using
import
*
.
The
program
prints
lists
of
the
selected
Groups
for
each
Test
row
when
the
window
closes
.
You
can
parse
your
bashrc
file
in
the
ipython
config
and
add
any
custom
aliases
you
have
defined
:
This
should
be
placed
in
~
/
.
ipython

profile_default

ipython_config.py
.
%
rehashx
makes
system
commands
available
in
the
alias
table

is
also
very
useful

you
want
to
use
ipython

it
seems
like
you
should
install
homebrew
and
then
just
run
:
Then
try
pip
again
.
Edit
The
full
list
of
dependencies
are
:
python
libffi
libssl
libxml2
libxslt1
So
you'll
need
all
those
","
and
their
headers
","
if
you
want
to
continue
down
this
path
.
An
easier
solution
is
to
download
pre-built
binaries
for
your
Mac
","
from
mitmproxy.org
(
OSX
Mountain
Lion
and
later
)
.
I
found
this
info
in
the
installation
docs
.
I
have
just
had
this
issue
.
It
arises
when
you
run
pytest
from
the
wrong
directory
","
e.g
.
wherever
you
happen
to
be
after
you
installed
it
.
To
solve
","
create
a
new
directory
and
cd
into
that
directory
create
the
file
test_sample.py
in
your
directory
with
content
as
per
the
pytest
tutorial
now
run
the
command
pytest
and
you
will
see
the
result
that
is
shown
in
the
tutorial
.
I'm
new
to
this
myself
but
I
believe
pytest
searches
the
directory
structure
from
where
it
is
run
looking
for
tests
.
Run
it
from
the
wrong
place
and
you'll
get
some
strange
results
if
it
sees
something
that
it
thinks
might
be
a
test
.
I
read
that
unit-test
is
a
brilliant
feature
to
write
better
code
and
assert
that
the
features
of
some
target
code
stay
the
same
.
So
I
wanted
to
use
it
...
I
am
using
Anaconda
on
my
Linux
machine
.
I
started
using
pytest
by
working
through
the
manual's
starter
guide
on
their
homepage
.
After
a
successful
installation
there
appears
a
first
(
unintended
)
error
:
I
would
like
to
understand
where
this
stupid
error
comes
from
and
how
I
can
resolve
it
.
Is
the
problem
that
I
execute
the
program
py.test
without
any
filename
and
that
there
is
no
file
called
__init.py__
?
OK
I
am
feeling
really
stupid
by
asking
this
question
but
please
take
the
question
serious
since
I
found
no
hint
in
the
world
wide
web
.
Based
on
the
question
","
comments
","
and
sample
data
exactly
as
it
is
posted
(
all
spaces
","
no
tabs
)
","
my
assumption
is
that
the
real
question
is
how
to
handle
the
fact
that
each
line
in
the
data
contains
a
different
number
of
spaces
between
each
field
.
Assuming
that
spaces
can
appear
within
a
field
","
but
only
one
at
a
time
","
and
that
two
or
more
spaces
delimit
a
field
","
the
following
regex
would
easily
find
the
breaks
between
each
field
(
two
or
more
spaces
)
:
Then
use
a
substitution
to
replace
all
the
deliminators
:
Of
course
","
that
doesn't
handle
the
line
endings
or
the
heading
.
But
for
the
heading
","
you
will
probably
want
to
split
on
lines
anyway
","
so
you
can
handle
the
end
of
the
line
also
:
Now
","
just
add
an
if
statement
or
two
within
the
loop
to
detect
the
heading
and
format
it
appropriately
and
you
have
a
working
solution
.
As
that
wasn't
specifically
asked
about
","
I'll
leave
that
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
.
In
Python
","
how
could
I
convert
a
whitespace-delimited
log
output
to
a
Markdown-formatted
table
?
I
have
an
output
log
that
contains
printouts
of
the
following
form
:
I
want
to
convert
this
to
a
form
like
the
following
(
Markdown
tables
)
:
One
way
to
do
this
could
be
to
replace
two
or
more
consecutive
spaces
with
a
vertical
bar
character
.
How
could
I
do
this
in
an
efficient
way
?
Given
that
the
table
is
always
to
have
three
columns
","
is
there
a
better
","
more
robust
way
to
do
this
?
If
you're
writing
""""
public
""""
function
","
I
believe
that
pythonic
way
would
be
to
check
arguments
(
using
if
","
not
assert
)
","
and
","
if
they're
invalid
","
raise
exception
with
type
and
info
/
message
designed
to
provide
as
much
info
as
possible
.
If
you're
writing
function
designed
for
internal
use
","
then
using
assert
to
check
the
arguments
seems
to
be
good
idea
for
me
.
I'm
confused
as
when
to
exactly
use
assertion
testing
in
my
python
functions
.
If
I
specify
assumptions
regarding
the
input
arguments
to
a
function
","
should
I
assume
that
correct
input
is
being
fed
to
the
function
or
should
I
use
assertions
to
check
the
conditions
on
the
input
args
enumerated
in
the
specification
?
New
to
the
python
library
PULP
and
I'm
finding
the
documentation
somewhat
unhelpful
","
as
it
does
not
include
examples
using
lists
of
variables
.
I've
tried
to
create
an
absolutely
minimalist
example
below
to
illustrate
my
confusion
.
The
output
is
:
The
optimizer
is
not
recognizing
the
constraint
that
we
only
add
two
values
.
I'll
leave
this
here
in
case
anyone
else
is
just
as
silly
","
but
actually
the
above
example
works
fine
.
I
had
merely
failed
to
examine
the
results
correctly
.
Instead
:
reveals
that
the
solution
is
correct
.
gethostbyaddr
will
also
query
the
hosts
file
-
/
etc
/
hosts
on
Linux
;
Windows
has
an
equivalent
at
%
SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
(
location
may
vary
with
older
versions
of
Windows
)
From
the
remote
computer
","
gethostbyaddr
will
be
doing
a
DNS
lookup
and
getting
mycomputer.com
.
On
your
local
computer
it
is
probably
getting
the
answer
from
your
hosts
file
","
which
contains
an
upper
case
version
of
your
hostname
.
I'm
using
Python
2.7.9
and
while
trying
to
use
socket.gethostbyaddr
","
I
found
some
perplexing
behavior
.
My
local
computer
has
a
public
ip
","
let's
say
111.111.111.111
.
If
I
use
on
a
remote
computer
:
I
get
'
mycomputer.com
'
.
However
","
using
the
same
command
on
my
local
computer
(
or
using
127.0.0.1
instead
of
my
public
ip
)
","
I
instead
get
'
MYCOMPUTER.com
'
.
Why
is
there
a
difference
in
capitalization
?
One
of
my
folders
has
mostly
json
files
","
and
I'm
reading
the
data
they
contain
to
do
some
classification
for
an
SVM
.
A
question
I
had
was
based
on
this
code
:
Each
time
I
pipe
the
output
","
I
find
that
the
filenames
always
get
printed
in
the
same
order
","
like
so
:
There
are
a
few
text
files
","
and
some
python
files
in
this
directory
.
My
question
here
is
:
what
determines
the
order
in
which
these
files
are
printed
?
Does
the
for
loop
have
a
way
of
looking
for
files
?
I
tried
examining
whether
this
order
is
based
on
size
(
max
to
min
or
min
to
max
)
or
last
"modified(I had no reason for these tests,I just tried them since I can't think of any other insight)"
.
I
tried
this
snippet
4
times
","
and
the
order
is
the
same
each
time
.
I
have
a
labelled
classes
in
different
folders
","
so
if
I
can
be
assured
of
the
order
it
would
be
helpful
in
the
labeling
for
my
training
set(I don't know how good an idea this is)
.
The
order
is
not
defined
","
and
depends
on
the
filesystem
.
I
remember
reading
","
many
years
ago
","
that
one
of
the
improvements
of
ext3
over
ext2
is
keeping
the
pointer
in
the
directory
listing
and
beginning
the
next
operation
on
that
entry
.
Often
a
program
will
stat()
then
open()
an
entry
","
so
scanning
from
the
beginning
of
the
(
internal
)
list
would
occur
twice
for
ext2
;
with
ext3
the
second
operation
would
already
be
on
the
desired
entry
making
the
search
for
it
very
fast
.
This
is
significant
with
many
files
in
a
directory
.
The
point
being
that
listing
the
directory
will
begin
the
list
of
entries
whereever
that
pointer
happened
to
be
.
Also
","
the
order
in
which
entries
are
created
may
affect
the
order
.
The
ls
program
performs
a
sort
operation
before
producing
output
so
that
it
is
visually
consistent
and
usable
.
When
I
tried
to
run
this
code
","
I
got
an
overflow
error
.
I
suspect
you're
having
the
same
problem
","
but
for
some
reason
","
it's
not
throwing
an
error
.
If
you
scale
down
the
features
","
everything
works
as
expected
.
Using
scipy.stats.linregress
:
Using
linear_model.SGDRegressor
:
The
value
for
slope
is
a
little
lower
","
but
I'd
guess
that's
because
of
the
regularization
.
I'm
trying
to
compare
Linear
Regression
(
Normal
Equation
)
with
SGD
but
it
looks
like
SGD
is
far
off
.
Am
I
doing
something
wrong
?
Here's
my
code
And
here's
my
SGD
I
would
have
thought
that
the
coef
and
intercept
would
be
almost
the
same
as
the
data
is
linear
.
If
you
only
want
a
single
line
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
left
scatter
","
you
can
do
like
so
:
I'm
creating
a
program
to
determine
a
minimum
","
maximum
","
and
percentiles
of
winds
at
certain
heights
.
The
file
is
split
into
5
columns
.
My
code
thus
far
looks
like
this
:
plt.show()
As
you
can
see
it's
plotting
each
min
and
max
at
the
specific
altitude
with
just
a
dot
.
How
can
I
adjust
that
so
it
makes
it
a
line
instead
.

sort
of
offset
in
the
question
seems
like
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
as
sliding
ranges
are
simpler
to
implement
with
a
more
or
less
continuous
sequence
of
real
numeric
values
.
You
can
use
the
offset
family
from
pd.tseries.offsets
.
Below
is
the
sample
code
.
I
am
pulling
a
chunk
of
data
within
a
range
of
time
.
It
is
pulling
date
and
times
from
column
recvd_dttm
.
It
takes
all
the
data
starting
from
a
year
ago
.
I
want
to
modify
it
so
that
it
can
pull
a
month
or
a
day
","
but
pd.DateOffset(months=1)
is
giving
a
KeyError:1
error
.
I
get
the
same
error
if
I
change
it
to
days=7
.
But
it
works
just
fine
with
years=1
.
What
is
going
on
here
?
EDIT
:
The
problem
was
coming
from
elsewhere
in
the
code
!
I
want
to
serve
some
Polymer-code
via
Django
in
a
Google
App
Engine
.
The
problem
is
","
that
Polymer
uses
double
curly
braces
","
as
does
Django
.
In
newer
Django
versions
","
one
can
use
the
verbatim-tag
","
but
in
the
version
used
in
Google
App
Engine
","
this
tag
is
not
implemented
.
Is
there
an
alternative
?
I
ended
up
using
Jinja2
instead
As
@Foon
pointed
out
","
the
canonical
way
to
do
this
is
to
subtract
a
column
.
However
","
on
a
side
note
","
as
your
problem
is
overdetermined
","
you
have
to
use
a
method
such
as
least
squares
.
By
definition
","
if
it's
an
overdetermined
problem
","
there
is
no
""""

(
Otherwise
it
would
be

-
A
square
matrix
.
)
That
aside
","
here's
how
you'd
go
about
it
:
Let's
take
your
example
equation
:
As
you
noted
","
this
is
overdetermined
.
If
we
know
one
of
our
""""
model
""""
variables
(
let's
say
n1
in
this
case
)
","
it
will
be
even
more
overdetermined
.
It's
not
a
problem
","
but
it
means
we'll
need
to
use
least
squares
","
and
there
isn't
a
completely
unique
solution
.
So
","
let's
say
we
know
what
n1
should
be
.
In
that
case
","
we'd
re-state
the
problem
by
subtracting
n1
multiplied
by
the
first
column
in
the
solution
matrix
from
our
vector
of
observations
(
This
is
what
@Foon
suggested
)
:
Let's
use
a
more
concrete
example
in
numpy
terms
.
Let's
solve
the
equation
y
=
Ax^2
+
Bx
+
C
.
To
start
with
","
let's
generate
our
data

""""

model
parameters

First
","
we'll
solve
it
_without

the
knowledge

B
=

We
could
use
np.polyfit
for
this
","
but
to
lead
into
the
next
bit
","
we'll
use
a
lower-level
approach
:
As
you
can
see
","
we'll
get
something
close
to
","
but
not
quite
1
.
In
this
case
(
I
didn't
set
the
seed
","
so
this
will
vary
)
","
the
model
parameters
returned
are
While
the
true
parameters
are
:
Now
let's
take
the
fact
that
we
know
b
exactly
into
account
.
We'll
make
a
new
G
with
one
less
column
and
subtract
that
column
times
b
from
our
observations
(
d
/
y
)
:
Now
m
is
"[a, c]"
and
we've
solved
for
those
two
variables
using
our
knowledge

b

put

Say
you
need

you

Then
you
need

just
call

end
up

http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.indexing.html#combining-advanced-and-basic-indexing
The
docs
talk
about
the
complexity
of
combining
advanced
and
basic
indexing
.
The
indexing
coords
comes
first
","
with
the
[
0
","
:
]
after
","
producing
the
the
(
3
","
5
)
.
The
easiest
way
to
understand
the
situation
may
be
to
think
in
terms
of
the
result
shape
.
There
are
two
parts
to
the
indexing
operation
","
the
subspace
defined
by
the
basic
indexing
(
excluding
integers
)
and
the
subspace
from
the
advanced
indexing
part
.
[
in
the
case
where
]
The
advanced
indexes
are
separated
by
a
slice
","
ellipsis
or
newaxis
.
For
example
x
[
arr1
","
:
","
arr2
]
.
....
the
dimensions
resulting
from
the
advanced
indexing
operation
come
first
in
the
result
array
","
and
the
subspace
dimensions
after
that
.
I
recall
discussing
this
kind
of
indexing
in
a
previous
SO
question
","
but
it
would
take
some
digging
to
find
it
.
https://stackoverflow.com/a/28353446/901925
Why
does
the
order
of
dimensions
change
with
boolean
indexing
?
How
does
numpy
order
array
slice
indices
?
The
[
:
]
in
test
[0]
[
:
]
[coords]
does
nothing
.
test
[0]
[
:
","
coords
]
produces
the
desired
(
5
","
3
)
result
.
If
I
slice
a
2d
array
with
a
set
of
coordinates
then
my
slice
has
the
shape
that
I
would
expect
But
if
I
repeat
this
with
a
3d
array
then
the
shape
is
now
Is
there
a
reason
that
these
are
different
?
Separating
the
indices
returns
the
shape
that
I
would
expect
Why
would
these
views
have
different
shapes
?
According
to
the
source
code
","
if
there
is
a
CloseSpider
exception
being
raised
","
engine.close_spider()
method
would
be
executed
:
engine.close_spider()
itself
would
close
the
spider
and
clear
all
outstanding

:
It
would
also
schedule
close_spider()
calls
for
different
components
of
Scrapy's
architecture
:
downloader
","

I
want
to
know
what
impact
of
raising
CloseSpider
.
In
documentation
http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/exceptions.html#closespider

is
no
information
about
it
.
As
you
know
scrapy
process
a

What
if
this
exception
will
be
raised

Will
it

I
am
attempting
to
use
Python
(
OpenCV
or
otherwise
)
to
classify
images
based
on
a
training
set
.
My
training
set
:
this
is
made
up
of
numerous
images
of
product
defects
.
Each
image
can
be
taken
in
1
of
3
locations
on
the
product
and
each
image
will
contain
1
of
5
types
of
product
defects
.
The
defects
have
been
manually
classified
and
validated
by
a
human
.
Images
to
classify
:
These
are
made
up

taken
in
the

3
locations
but
the
type

(
although
the
defective
area
IS
recognized
by
the
tool
taking
the
picture
","
it's
just
that
the
tool
does
not
CORRECTLY
classify
them
and
I
can't
change
the
tool
)
.
I
have
attempted
to
do
this
classification
following
recommendations
in
the
book
Programming
Computer
Vision
with
Python
:
Tools
and
algorithms
for
analyzing
images
.
In
this
case
I
use
SIFT
descriptors
stored
in
a
mySQL
database
(
training
data
)

So

this

where
I've
ended
up
.
A
work
in
progress
","
you
can
always
get
better
.
My
solution
right
now
has
been
to
combine
3
different
approaches
.
All
are
searchable
on
the
internet
so
I
won't
go
to
great
detail
on
the
how
.
First
","
I
used
the
SIFT
approach
","
generating
SIFT
histograms
using
a
command
line
call
to
VLFeat
.
This
may
be
an
option
elsewhere
in
Python
","
it's
just
what
I
used
.
I
used
k-means
clustering
to
do
the
visual
bag
of
words
vocabulary
thing
and
built
a
database
tying
the
centroid's
to
word
histograms
associated
with
the
training
images
.
I
improved
results
a
bit
by
adding
a
Root
SIFT
step
.
Then
I
created
a
separate
database
using
Dense
SIFT
(
but
no
Root
SIFT
adjustments
)
.
Lastly
","
I
created
a
database
of
color
histograms
based
on
the
RGB
components
of
the
training
images
.
I
don't
use
all
256
bins
of
RGB
but
went
with
summing
individual
R
","
G
and
B
values
over
8
bins
and
then
flattening
the
values
to
a
24
bin
histogram
.
This
same
process
is
followed
with
the
unknown
images
","
and
then
histogram
vectors
are
compared
using
Euclidean
distance
.
I
tried
Chi
Squared
comparison
as
well
but
","
in
my
case
Euclidean
provided
better
results
.
I
take
the
top
3
results
from
each
process
","
with
image
classification
based
on
5
of
9
vote
.
If
a
majority
isn't
reached
then
the
analysis
is
indeterminate
.
For
my
closed
population
of
images
I
am
at
3.1
%
misclassification
rate
","
3.1
%
indeterminate
.
Implementing
a
CNN
in
Theano
will
probably
give
you
better
results
than
anything
in
OpenCV
.
If
you
search
on
Google
scholar
there
are
a
huge
number
of
papers
on
image
classification

most
of
these
approaches
should
not
be
difficult

implement

more
complicated
than
this
then
you
might
want
to
look
into
a
library
that
handles
it
for
you
","
such
as
argparse
.
A
quick
and
dirty
way
to
do
this
would
be
:
Then
you
can
run
myscript.py
hello
or
myscript.py
goodbye
","
and
when
you
add
other
global
/
top
level
functions
they
will
work
immediately
.
A
better
way
to
do
this
though
would
be
to
use
something
like
argparse
and
maybe
even
https://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html#sub-commands
You
have
to
create
a
thread
in
the
background
.
Different
threads
may
run
at
one
time
.
Dialog
box
stops
current
thread
and
waits
while
user
make
a
choice
.
This
is
normal
behavior
.
Python
has
very
easy
threading
API
.
Thread
is
function
that
is
passed
as
an
argument
to
a
thread
class
constructor
.
Thread
executes
this
function
then
","
and
you
may
start
several
threads
","
they
will
not
lock
the
current
thread
.
Move
your
dialog
or
background
code
to

separate
thread

You
are
confused
between
media
and
static
.
Hopefully
this
will
clarify
the
matter
:
Static
Files
Static
files
are
files
that
are
shipped
as
part
of
your
application
.
STATIC_ROOT
is
where
the
collectstatic
command
will
dump
all
static
files
","
so
you
can
move
them
to
the
production
web
server
.
You
don't
need
to
mess
with
STATIC_ROOT
during
development
.
In
your
case
","
you
have
an
application
Vote
","
and
inside
it
you
have
a
static
folder
.
That's
all
you
need
to
serve
static
files
during
development
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
{
%
static
'
folder
/
filename.ext
'
%
}
where
folder
is
the
folder
inside
static
that
contains
your
file
.
So
if
your
directory
structure
is
:
You
need
<
img
src
=
""""
{
%
static
'
vote
/
images
/
foo.jpg
'
%
}
""""
>
Media
Files
Media
files
are
what
django
calls
files
that
are
uploaded
by
your
application's
users
For
uploading
files
","
you
need
to
set
a
location
where
all
uploaded
files
are
stored
.
This
location
is
the
parent
directory
and
its
universal
across
your
entire
project
.
The
setting
for
this
is
MEDIA_ROOT
.
This
should
be
a
full
system
file
path
.
Suppose
you
set
MEDIA_ROOT
=
'
/
home
/
foo
/
bar
/
proj
/
media
'
","
and
in
your
models
you
have
:

uploaded
to
/
home
/
foo
/
bar
/
proj
/
media
/
logos
/
.
To
display
these
files
","
you
need
to
tell
django
the
name
of
a
link
that
points
to
the
MEDIA_ROOT
directory
","
this
setting
is
MEDIA_URL
.
For
development
","
you
need
to
do
three
things
:
Set
MEDIA_URL
to
/
media
/
Configure
urls.py
to
serve
media
files
:
Add
'
django.template.context_processors.media
'
to
context_processors
in
TEMPLATES
.
This
will
activate
{
{
MEDIA_URL
}
}
in
your
templates
.
I
am
new
to
django
and
tried
to
fix
this
problem

couldn't
find
whats

the

EDIT
1:added
some
code
Someone
also
told
me
that
I
should
add
this
to
my
code
The
Problem
now
is
that
the
When
I
try
to
get
Image
","
the
program
looks
for
images
at

Which
I
think
he
takes
from
my
urls.py
file
.
But
I
dont
get
why
is
the
program
looking
in
/
Vote
/
ID
/
voting
...
instead
of
MEDIA_ROOT
.
Or
does
GET
not
mean
that
it
is
looking
at
that
place
?
This
is
my
Vote
/
urls.py
:
Change
your
MEDIA_ROOT
according
to
the
path
of
your
media
files
:
For
eg
.
C:\Users\Vato\PycharmProjects\Project3\Vote\media
change
property
"name(if you need property, here no need of it to define.Because you have an instance variable username)"
","
Because
you
have
created
a
instance
variable
with
same
name
.
With
your
property
you
have
created
an
infinite
recursion
.
self.username
in
the
return
statement
calls
the
property
method
again
","
and
againâ
€
¦
Remove
the
whole
property
from
your
code
and
it
will
work
.
Python
does
not
need
explicid
accessors
.
Your
are
causing
a
race
condition
by
returning
a
call
to
the
method
username()
You
call
the
method
","
it
returns
the
method

is
then
called
again
ad
infinitum

do

The

I
passed
it

Each

ends
up

the

Note
that
even

the

Django
lazy
QuerySet
and
pagination
So
I
was
reading
about
pagination

I
have
done
it
quite
a
few
times
writing

I
was
wondering
how
does
pagination
in
django
work
at
sql
level
.
Does
Contacts.objects.all()
get
called
evertime
I
am
hitting
the
view
?
Or
does
Paginator
maintains
a
state
somehow
?
What
would
the
sql
query
look
like
for
paginator
=
"Paginator(contact_list, 25)"
Are
there
generators
being
used
behind
the
scenes
and
things
are
lazily
evaluated
?
Sorry
if
this
is
a
dumb
question
","
there
is
a
lot
of
abstraction
in
Django
and
I
seem
to
miss
all
the
action
behind
.
Thanks
in

May
be
it
will
help
you
bit
more
to
handle
.
I
am
writing
a
web
service
using
Django
that
will
be
consumed
from
a
MS
SharePoint
workflow
.
In
the
SP
workflow
","
I
created
a
dictionary
with
2
items
(
id:1
","
text:'foo
'
)
","
and
used
this
dictionary
as
the
request
content
.
However
","
instead
of
using
the
dictionary
to
format
a
traditional
POST
parameter
list
","
it
sends
it
as
a
JSON
object
in
the
body
of
the
POST
request
","
so
instead
of
the
expected
:
in
the
body
of
the
request
","
there
is
this
:
which
of
course
","
in
turn
","
does
not
get
parsed
correctly
by
Python
/
Django
(
I
am
not
sure
who
exactly
does
the
parsing
)
.
How
can
I
either
get
it
to
parse
JSON
","
or
get
SharePoint
to
send
traditionally
encoded
POST
parameters
?
EDIT
I
saw
other
posts
that
explain
how
to
get
the
raw
body
and
parse
the
JSON
.
I
was
looking
for
a
solution
that
would
either
:
Make
SharePoint
send
normal
data
","
or
Get
Django
to
respect
the
Content-type
header
that
states
the
data
is
JSON
There
is
no
need
for
any
parsing
at
the
framework
level
.
The
body
of
the
post
request
is
always
available
in
request.body
","
so
you
can
access
it
directly
:
Worker
will
reserve
tasks
for
each
worker's
tread
.
If
you
want
to
limit
the
number
of
tasks
worker
can
execute
the
same
time
","
you
should
configure
your
concurrency
(
e.g
.
to
limit
1
task
at
the
time
","
you
need
worker
with
1
process
-
c
1
)
.
You
can
also
check
prefetch
configuration
","
but
it
only
defines
the
number
of
tasks
reserved
for
each
process
of
the
worker
.
Here
is
Celery
documentation
where
prefetch
configuration
explained
:
http://celery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/userguide/optimizing.html
As
I
see
in
celery
","
It
can
get
number
of
tasks
for
a
worker
","
that
can
run
them
at
a
same
time
.
I
need
run
a
task
and
set
number
of
tasks
can
run
simultaneously
with
this
task
.
Therefore
","
If
I
set
this
number
to
2
and
this
task
send
to
worker
with
10
threads
","
worker
can
run
just
one
another
task
.
Consider
this
:
Same
thing
with
slicing
done
before
Now
why
is
the
second
method
faster
than
first
method
?
What
exactly
is
taking
place
here
which
is
causing
the
second
method
to
be
more
efficient
than
first
?
EDIT
:
This
is
a
part
of
a
big
program
which
I
was
attempting
at
one
of
the
sites
.
I
was
getting
timeout
error
with
method
1
with
large
inputs
.
Whereas
the
second
method
did
it
.
It
was
at
least
2
secs
faster.The
string
length
was
10000
for
this
scenario.Here
are
the
two

http://hackerearth.com/submission/2130107
#
Method
2
Your
diagnosis
appears
to
be
flawed
.
Using
the
timeit
module
you'll
find
that
using
addional
locals
is
in
fact
slower
","
but
only
by
the
smallest
of
margins
.
I
reduced
your
tests
to
the
essentials
to
reduce
overhead
:
The
difference
is
so
small
as
to
be
negligible
.
If
you
run
this
often
enough
f2
can
win
by
the
same
margin
.
If
you
reverse
the
tests
(
run
f2
first
","
then
f1
)
","
the
outcomes
change
again
.
That's
because
there
is
practically
no
difference
.
The
two
functions
execute
the
exact
same
bytecodes
","
with
the
addition
of
two
STORE_FAST
and
LOAD_FAST
opcodes
for
f2
at
indices
22
","
47
","
50
and
53
.
The
STORE_FAST
and
LOAD_FAST
copy
across
a
pointer
between
the
stack
and
the
locals
array
","
both
pre-allocated
structures
.
So
f2
is
doing
the
teensiest
more
work
than
f1
is
doing
.
Changing
the
sizes
of
the
inputs
is
not
making
a
difference
here
","
a
pointer
doesn't
get
'
heavier
'
if
the
referenced
object
is
bigger
.
If
you
examine
your
results
a
little
more
closely
on
the
linked
hackerearth
site
you
will
see
that
","
individually
","
the
first
method
is
quicker
on
most
of
the
inputs
.
What
happened
is
that
the
last
two
results
(
for
inputs
7
and
8
)
didn't
complete
in
a
timely
fashion
","
which
resulted
in
an
overall
longer
runtime
.
Why
is
anyone's
guess
","
maybe
the
server
was
under
heavy
load
at
that
time
and
your
process
had
a
low
priority
.
So
today
in
science
class
I
thought
of
making
a
python
script
for
basic
perimeter
of
a
quadrilateral
.
Later
in
future
I
want
to
expand
into
circle
and
other
shape
but
I
got
stuck
in
error
.
Please
help
.
My
code
:
https://repl.it/xHG
And
the
output
comes
funky
.
If
l=2
and
b=1
then
output
comes
as
2211
.
Also
","
how
do
you
expand
it
into
different
shapes
?
I
was
thinking
of
using
if
and
else
options
so
if
choice
=
circle
then
execute
circle
code
elif
if
choice
=
triangle
then
execute
triangle
code
.
Does
anyone
have
a
better
idea
?
Remember
to
convert
data
types
You
need
to
convert
you
input
to
an
int
or
float
.
In
your
code
len
is
a
string
","
and
therefor
when
you
perform
len
+
len
you
are
performing
String
concatenation
In
Python
3
","
input
returns
a
string
(
this
is
different
in
Python
2.x
","
which
may
be
part
of
the
confusion
)
.
That
means
that
length
=
len
+
len
is
actually
performing
string
concatenation
","
ie
.
'
2
'
+
'
2
'
=
'
22
'
.
Using
either
"int(input(""..."")"
)
or
"float(input(""..."")"
)
will
turn
them
into
numbers
.
(
note
that
both
functions
will
create
errors
if
the
user
puts
in
strings
that
can't
be
converted
to
numbers
.
Ok
-
with
a
bit
more
time
spent
I've
managed
to
find
a
solution
that
worked
for
me
:
for
every
key
in
the
error
dictionary
submit
the
form
and
loop
through
and
check
for
errors
present
and
then
return

up

selenium
webdriver
and
Python
so
please
excuse
any
'
best
practice
'
issues
in
my
code
.
I'm
trying
to
find
a
solution
that
counts
the
instance
of
field
errors
on
a
web
form

if
it
is
greater
than

equal
to
1

the

should
be
a

If
zero

a

In

I
would
like
to
print

the

which
field
errors
being
presented
.
I'm
using
xpaths
stored
in
a
dictionary
for
maintainability
and
then
returning
the

from
the

(
which
is
also
my
xpath
identifier
)
.
In
addition
the

only
presented

the
fly

need
to
handle
the

I
know
what
I
want
to
achieve

can't
seem
to

the
syntax
right
so
every
time
the
result
is
'

-
I
believe
this
is
because
1
or
more
of
my
xpaths
are
returning
the
exception

Below

do
the

Here

In

the
'

submits
the

the
csv
has
a
value...I
don't
think
this
is
needed
to
answer
my
question
but
thought
best
to
provide
for
insight
.
I'm
using
a
platform
that
","
when
you
upload
pdf's
to
it
","
converts
the
pdf
with
the
base64
encode
in
Python
.
Then
it
stores
the
binary
string
in
the
database
.
Now
I
want
to
decode
the
strings
and
write
them
to
a
local
folder
","
so
I
thought
to
use
the
'
with
open
'
structure
and
pass
it
the
b
parameter
for
binary
and
then
it
should
create
test.pdf
based
of
my
decoded
string
and
write
it

my
desktop

Yet
this
yields

doing

:
Example
binary
string
in
database
:
""""
65
/
658e9014babd33786821f3130c5f3a1cc1322ddf
""""
So
I'm
assuming
it
starts
after
the
'
/
'
mark
?
"base64.decode(,)"
takes
files
as
args
.
you
want
to
try
though
your
code
example
is
not
encoded
.
Here's
a
working
example
:
I
have
a
string
like
this
:
Original
was
encoded
in
""""
utf-8
""""
My
question
is
:
how
do
i
transform
this
byte-like
into
string
""""
as
is
""""
?
I
mean
","
keeping
the
b
'
","
\
xc2

\
n
...
If
I
use
"str.decode(""utf-8"")"
I
loose
most
of
the
stuff
.
You
can
use
repr(string)
-
that's
exactly
how
the
string
with
'
b
'
prefix
and
escape
sequences
is
created
.
some
change
output
","
t3
is
python
file
t3.py
Although
you
delete
the
h
","
the
object
was
still
referenced
by
g
and
f
.
gc
Python
use
reference
count
to
reclaim
memory
.
That
is
because
deleting
an
object
does
not
automatically
delete
objects
that
it
references
.
Meaning
lets
say
we
have
-
When
we
do
del
l
","
it
deletes
the
name
l
","
not
the
object
it
references
.
Example
-
It
just
decreases
the
reference
for
the
object
by
1
","
when
the
references
for
an
object
reaches
0
it
can
get
garbage
collected
.
So
in
your
binary
search
tree
case
","
when
you
do
-
You
are
just
deleting
the
local
variable
/
name
min_right
","
not
the
object
it
references
.
To
delete
the
attribute
:
It
will
be
gone
and
not
None
.
To
set
it
to
None
:
Don't
use
an
intermediate
variable
!
You
have
a
situation
that
looks
like
this
:
i.e.
three
references
to
the
same
underlying
object
.
All
that
del
h
does
is
remove
the
name
h
","
like
this
:
The
underlying
object
doesn't
change
","
and
the
two
other
names
still
provide
a
reference
to
it
","
all
you've
done
is
remove
one
reference
to
the
Foo
instance
.
h
is
now
a
NameError
","
but
g
and
f.attr
will
work
just
fine
.
I
don't
know
why
you
would
conclude
that
-
if
you
did
succeed
in
breaking
the
reference
from
f.attr
to
the
Foo
instance
","
you
would
get
an

Imagine

You

fix
this
by
adding
while

for
loop

sending
a

Why
is
that

Do
I

Actually
","
there
are
a
few
problems
here

First
","
the

Update
I'm
going

I
think
it's
still
useful

to
your
question

possibly
due
to
a
morning
caffeine
deficit
","
who
knows
?

.
Since
your

calling
send

a
single
message

then
exiting
immediately
","
the

probably
never
have
time

You
would
typically
expect
the

If

insert

things

work

This
works

","
this
isn't
a
great
solution...anything

synchronization

A
different
way
of
solving
this
would
be
to
have
your

open
both
a
PUB
socket
and
a
REP
socket
.
To
send
a

to
all

your
tool
would
open
a
REQ
socket
to
the
broker
","

would
then
publish
it

all

The
problem

this

Since

it
is
likely
that
your
are
simply
losing
the
message

there

a

it

Your

want

reduce

Perhaps
something

would
be
better

I
understand
this

more
code

I
think
in
the
end
it's
a

clearer

also
might
force
you

come
up

Depending
on
what
you're
doing
.
Because
functions
are
also
objects
in
Python
it
is
possible
to
do
so
.
But
is
it
a
good
solution
?
It
seems
though
that
you're
trying
to
handle
a
problem
which
maybe
could
be
better
solved
with
more
of
an
object
oriented
approach

Output

In
my
view
this
would
be
a
better
approach

if
this
is
possible
/
reasonable
in
your
case
)
:
You
just
call
some_method()
on
your
class
","
maybe
without
even
knowing
what
exact
type
of
object
you're
dealing
with
(
regarding
inheritance
)
.
The
class
itself
knows
what
to
do
and
reacts
accordingly
when
its
method
has
been
called
.
This
of
course
doesn't
work
when
you
work
with
external
libraries
which
you
have
no
influence
on
.
Your
code
is
""""
technically
correct
""""
(
it
does
what
you
ask

at

pretty
useless

FWIW
is
the
same
as
:

I
assume
you
understood
this
already
.
Now
you
probably
have
a
reason
to
try
to
pass
both
the
method
AND
instance
to
external_func()
","
or
there
might
be
a
better
way
to
solve
your
real
problem
...
This
is
how
it
works
for
me

This
appears
to
work
correctly

Is
this
the
right

suggestions

When
you
want
to
use
a
module
in
another
one
","
you
have
to
import it
and
so
use
import your_module
.
You
have
to
type
your_module.foo()
if
you
want
to
use
a
method
inside
it
.
With
the
instruction
from
your_module
import attr1
","
foo1
","
[
...
]
you
are
modifying
the
module's
global
variables
","
so
that
you
can
use
attr1
or
the
method
foo1
as
if
they
were
in
your
module
.
A
concrete
example
is
:
if
you
want
to
use
the
math
module
","
you
type
import math
and
when
you
want
to
use
the
constant
pi
you
type
math.pi
","
but
if
you
are
sure
there
will
be
no
clash
with
the
other
names
","
you'll
type
from
math
import pi
and
you
will
use
the
constant
pi
as
if
you
declared
it
in
your
module
.
Indeed
-
if
AAA.py
imports
something
from
BBB.py
at
top
level
and
vice
versa
","
it
doesn't
work
as
intended
.
There
are
two
ways
you
can
solve
it
:
Import
the
modules
from
each
other
.
This
way
they
are
both
present
as
their
namespace
and
will
be
filled
during
the
import process
.
So
just
do
import BBB
and
use
BBB.BBB()
for
instantiating
the
class
:
Do
the
import where
you
need
it
:
This
way
the
link
between
the
two
modules
is
""""
looser
""""
and
not
so
tight
.
Not
sure
whether
it's
any
faster
","
but
you
could
rewrite
that
code
using
itertools.combinations
and
get
the
min
using
a
key
function
calculating
the
""""
distance
""""
.
If
this
does
not
help
","
you
might
consider
temporarily
turning
the
dictionaries
in
_list
into
lists
","
holding
just
the
values
of
the
relevant
fields
.
Instead
of
using
dictionary
lookup
","
you
can
then
just
zip
those
lists
together
with
the
weights
.
Afterwards
","
turm
them
back
into
dicts

This
should
be
a
bit
faster
","

it
will
only
work

the
dicts
do
not
have
any
other
fields

those

self.__fields

otherwise
the
dicts
can
not
be
reconstructed
from
the
lists

at
least
not
as
easily
)
.
Alternatively
","
you
might
use
tuples
instead
of
lists
and
use
another
dictionary
to
map
those
tuples

the
original
dictionaries

Or
try
this
","
using
the
indices
of
the
elements

of
the
elements
themselves
(
not
tested
)

In
my
python
application
I
have
a
big
list
(
now
with
almost
9000
indexes
)
.
I
need
to
find
the
two
most
similar
items
in
this
list
.
So
","
what
I
have
now
is
something
like
:
In
the
code
","
weights
is
a
dict
","
obj1
and
obj2
are
both
objects
in
which
the
__getitem__
is
implemented
and
the
return
value
also
comes
from
a
dict
.
And
self.__fields
is
a
list
with
the
selected
fields
(
it
has
now
9
items
)
.
My
problem
is
","
this
loop
is
taking
too
much
time
to
complete
.
Even
after
5
hours
","
the
i
variable
still
in
the
first
100th
list
items
.
With
this
next
silly
code
","
I
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
problem
is
not
the
size
of
the
list
(
the
silly
code
finishes
with
5
minutes
of
difference
)
.
Therefore
","
the
problem
seems
to
be
in
the
most
internal
loop
of
my
code
:
I
know
Python
","
but
I'm
not
a
Python
specialist
.
I
conclude
that
the
access
to
the
values
of
three
objects
through
their
key
is
a
slow
operation
.
Some
time
ago
","
I
saw
in
some
blog
that
list
comprehensions
and
/
or
lambda
operations
can
be
faster
.
So
","
my
question
is
:
how
do
I
make
this
most
internal
loop
faster
using
list
comprehensions
and
/
or
lambda
?
Feel
free

give
any
other
advice

you
want

You
can
try
this
-
Assume
that
I
have
the
following
data
How
do
I
find
all
indices

","
say
","
date_list

This

be
an
easy
problem

I
can't

it
out

If

actually
create

I
want

keep

ConfigParser
stores
all

Is
there
a

The
http://127.0.0.1:8000/song/299d8fe1-7d9f-434a-ba64-94fb7a16b1a6/gives
me
the
desired
page
based
on
the
uuid
of
the
song
and
works
fine
.
(
It's
the
second
url
.
)
Here
is
the
urls.py
The
third
url
","
the
one
the
arrow
is
pointing
at
","
gives
me
a
404
error
","
with
the
message
""""
No

given
query

""""
I'm
guessing
there's
an
error
with
the
regex
","
but
I
can't
figure
it
out
.
EDIT
Here
are
the
views
for
both
the
song
and
song
info
:
views.py
you
should
use
this
url
Here
","
[
^
/
]
represents
any
type
of
character
but
/
","
and
the
+
right
after
matches
this
class
of
character
one
or
more
times
.
You
do
not
want
the
final
/
to
be
in
the
uuid
var
","
so
put
it
outside
the
parentheses
\
S
+
matches
any
sequence
of
characters
","
including
'
/
'
.
So
your
second
regex
is
matching
the
entire
string
of
""""
299d8fe1-7d9f-434a-ba64-94fb7a16b1a6
/
song_info
/
""""
as
the
UUID
parameter
","
and
sending
it
to
views.song
","
which
unsurprisingly
does
not
find
a
matching
song
.
You
should
make
your
regexes
more
discriminating
:
Also
","
you
should
usually
put
your
regexes
in
order
of
more
specific
to
more
general
;
Django
matches
in
order
","
so
if
you
had
put
song_info
first
that
would
also
have
solved
your
problem
.
If
you
want
to
run
a
Python
code
in
a
separate
process
","
you
could
use
multiprocessing
module
:
I
wondered
whether
using
a
subprocess
module
and
multiprocess
module
in
the
same
function
is
prohibited
?
No
.
You
can
use
both
subprocess
and
multiprocessing
in
the
same
function
(
moreover
","
multiprocessing
may
use
subprocess
to
start
its
worker
processes
internally
)
.
Reason
I
want
this
is
that
I
have
two
things
to
run
:
first
an
exe
file
","
and
second
a
function
","
each
needs
it
own
process
.
You
don't
need
multprocessing
to
run
an
external
command
without
blocking
(
obviously
","
in
its
own
process
)
;
subprocess.Popen()
is
enough
:
Subprocess.Popen
is
definitely
what
you
want
if
the
""""
worker
""""
process
is
an
executable
.
Threading
is
what
you
need
when
you
need
things
to
happen
asynchronously
","
and
multiprocessing
is
what
you
need
if
you
want
to
take
advantage
of
multiple
cores
for
the
improved
performance
(
although
you
will
likely
find
yourself
also
using
threads
at
the
same
time
as
they
handle
asynchronous
output
of
multiple
parallel
processes
)
.
The
main
limitation
of
multiprocessing
is
passing
information
.
When
a
new
process
is
spawned
","
an
entire
separate
instance
of
the
python
interpreter
is
started
with
it's
own
independent
memory
allocation
.
The
result
of
this
is
variables
changed
by
one
process
won't
be
changed
for
other
processes
.
For
this
functionality
you
need
shared
memory
objects
(
also
provided
by
multiprocessing
module
)
.
One
implementation
I
have
done
was
a
parent
process
that
started
several
worker
processes
and
passed
them
both
an
input
queue
","
and
an
output
queue
.
The
function
given
to
the
child
processes
was
a
loop
designed
to
do
some
calculations
on
the
inputs
pulled
from
the
input
queue
and
then
spit
them
out
to
the
output
queue
.
I
then
designated
a
special
input
that
the
child
would
recognize
to
end
the
loop
and
terminate
the
process
.
On
your
edit
-
Popen
will
start
the
other
process
in
parallel
","
as
will
multiprocessing
.
If
you
need
the
child
process
to
communicate
with
the
executable
","
be
sure
to
pass
the
file
stream
handles
to
the
child
process
somehow
.
New
to
multiprocessing
in
python
","
consider
that
you
have
the
following
function
:
Now
the
point
is
that
I
want
the
doit.main
to
run
in
another
process
and
to
be
non
blocking
","
so
the
code
in
do_something_else
will
run
immediately
after
the
first
has
been
launched
in
another
process
.
How
can
I
do
it
using
python
subprocess
module
?
Is
there
a
difference
between
subprocessing
and
creating
new
process
aside
to
another
one
","
why
would
we
need
a
child
processes
of
other
process
?
Note
:
I
do
not
want
to
use
multithreaded
approach
here
.
.
EDIT
:
I
wondered
whether
using
a

around

this
","

I
found
the
solution
for
my
question
along
similar
lines
as
what
JAB

.
I
will
first
do
a
groupby
using
the
column
id

After
this
","
I
will
apply
the
resample
method
","
and
then
use
the
reset_index()
method
to
get
back
a
DataFrame
that
looks
more
or
less
what
I
have
before
:
The
pattern
I
use
for
this
problem
is
to
pivot
the
table
so
you
only
have
the
date
as
an
index
.
This
will
allow
the
resample
function
to
work
.
You
can
then
stack
the
dataframe
and
reset
the
index
to
put
the
field
id
back
as
a
column

the
list
with
the
names
and
their
averages
next
to
them
?
I
have
tried
the
avg
function
but
got
stuck
.
First
this
find
the
average
of
the
data
","
and
adds
it
to
the
list
datam
","
as
well
as
the
name
.
Then
it
sorts
this
by
the
second
item
(
index
1
","
the
mean
)
.
It
also
reverses
it
","
to
go
from
Hight
to
Low
.
printing
this
gives
the
following
:
Because
it
means
to
match
the
previous
token
","
the
*
","
as
few
times
as
possible
","
which
is
0
times
.
If
you
would
it
to
extend
to
the
end
of
the
string
","
add
a
$
","
which
matches
the
end
of
string
.
If
you
would
like
it
to
match
at
least
one
","
use
+
instead
of
*
.
The
reason
the
first
group
.
*
?
matches
24036
is
because
you
have
the
\
s
token
after
it
","
so
the
fewest
amount
of
characters
the
.
*
?
could
match
and
be
followed
by
a
\
s
is
24036
.
@iobender
has
pointed
out
the
answer
to
your
question
.
But
I
think
it's
worth
mentioning
that
if
the
numbers
are
separated
by
space
","
you
can
just
use
split
:
This
is
simpler
","
easier
to
understand
and
often
faster
than
regex
.
I'm
trying
to
parse
a
text
document
with
data
in
the
following
format
:
24036
-
977
.
I
need
to
separate
the
numbers
into
separate
values
","
and
the
way
I've
done
that
is
with
the
following
steps
.
This
does
the
job
","
however
I
was
curious
about
why
using
(
.
*
?
)
in
the
second
group
causes
the
regex
to
fail
?
I
tested
it
in
the
online
regex
tester(https://regex101.com/r/bM2nK1/1)
","
and
adding
the
?
in
causes
the
second
group
to
return
nothing
.
Now
as
far
as
I
know
.
*
?
means
to
take
any
value
unlimited
times
","
as
few
times
as
possible
","
and
the
.
*
is
just
the
greedy
version
of
that
.
What
I'm
confused
about
is
why
the
non
greedy
version
.
*
?
takes
that
definition
to
mean
capturing
nothing
?
I
am
using
a
3rd
party
python
library
that
creates
.
svg's
(
specifically
for
evolutionary
trees
)
which
has
a
render
function
for
tree
objects
.
What
I
want
is
the
svg
in
string
form
that
I
can
edit
.
Currently
I
save
the
svg
and
read
the
file
as
follows
:
This
works
","
but
is
it
possible
to
use
a
tempfile
instead
?
So
far
I
have
:
Can
anyone
explain
why
this
doesn't
work
and
/
or
how
I
could
do
this
without
creating
a
file
(
which
I
just
have
to
delete
later
)
.
The
svg_string
I
go
on
to
edit
for
use
in
a
django
application
.
EDIT
:
Importantly
","
the
render
function
can
also
be
used
to
create
other
filetypes
e.g
.
.
png
-
so
the
.
svg
extension
needs
to
be
specified
.
You
should
not
define
yourself
the
name
of
your
temporary
file
.
When
you
create
it
","
the
name
will
be
randomly
generated
.
You
can
use
it
directly
.
First
","
there's
a
duplication
in
your
code
(
reading
target
file
twice
)
.
And
you
can
use
shutil.copyfileobj
and
hashlib.update
for
memory-efficient
routine
.

I
didn't
test
this

how
it

now
:
Currently
the

just
shy

it's
not
that
taxing

the

do
this

I
have
data
from
a

this

i.e
the
amount

exit_status

or
exit_status
=

-
11
)
versus
start_time
in
bins
of
1
hour
.
Since
there
are
several
distinct
exit_status
codes
","
I
need
to
plot
it
in
the
form
of
a
stacked
bar
chart
where
each
distinct
exit
status
is
given
a
different
color
.
Can
anyone
please
help
me
?
I've
been
stuck
on
this
for
2
days
!
!
Thanks
!
Here's
how
I
would
solve
it
:
Read
the
csv-file
.
This
can
be
done
using
the
csv
module
for
python
Read
and
/
or
convert
the
date
stamps
according
to
your
bin
size
","
and
iterate
through
each
line
","
adding
to
the
correct
hour
bin
.
I
just
do
it
the
dirty
way
and
cut
the
minutes
and
seconds
:
row
[0]
[
:
-
5
]
returns
15
/
07
/
2015
11
","
a
date
and
hour
to
work
with
.
You'll
end
up
with
a
list
status_records
which
consists
of
two
dicts
","
representing
the
two
status
options
","
which
then
contain
the
hour
bins
:
""""
1
""""
:
{
""""
15
/
07
/
2015

the
xmltodict
library
makes
it
easy
to
turn
the
XML
data
into
nested
dictionaries
","
more
or
less
like
JSON
.
A
set
of
helpers
that
parse
the
contents
and
generate
appropriate
C-struct
strings

all
that's
really
needed

If

can
work
with
dictionaries

You
can
do
something

Which
will
produce
something
like
:
I'd
try
to
get
it
working
with
basic
functions
first
before
trying
to
build
up
a
class
scaffold
.
It
would
be
pretty
easy
to
hide
the
details
in
a
class
using
property
descriptors
:
I
need
some
advice
.
Two
questions
","
does
something
already
exist
for
this
","
what
modules
should
I
use
to
develop
this
.
I
have
some
structures
that
come
from
an
XML
file
.
I
want
to
represent
them
in
Python
Classes
(
maybe
using
a
factory
to
create
a
class
per
structure
)
.
But
I
want
these
classes
to
have
a
function
that
will
emit
the
structure
as
a
C
Struct
.
From
my
research
ctypes
seems
like
the
recommended
thing
to
use
to
represent
the
structures
in
Python
classes
","
but
I
don't
see
any
methods
for
anything
that
will
emit
C
Stucts
for
the
creation
of
a
header
file
.
A
third
","
unrelated
detail
was
the
problem
:
pyenv
.
There's
a
bug
report
here
","
but
long
story
short
is
that
pyenv
uses
shims
to
intercept
package
imports
and
route
them
correctly
.
This
means
that
pyenv
has
to
muddle
with
the
path
.
When
I
run
python
directly
","
the
shims
are
apparent
in
the
python
path
:
However
","
in
the
dynamically
imported
package
","
the
same
code
results
in
an
output
of
:
So
","
the
issue
appears
to
be
that
pyenv
isn't
doing
its
shim
magic
during
dynamic
imports
.
To
solve
the
problem
","
I
used
pip
install
-
-
user
to
force
pip
to
install
to
the
place
where
the
dynamic
import is
looking
","
rather
than
where
pyenv
wants
the
install
to
go
.
(
also
add
a
-
I
if
you've
previously
installed
the
package
to
force
a
reinstall
)
It
can
also
be
solved
by
appending
the
install
location
(
in
my
case
","
/
usr
/
lib
/
python2.7
/
site-packages
)
to
the
python
path
using
sys.path.append
","
but
that
smells
awful
and
could
cause
problems
down
the
line
for
other
people
.
Virtualenvs
are
notorious
.
They
tinker
around
with
paths
lots
of
times
and
mess
up
quite
a
lot
of
things
.
You
need
to
check
the
PATH
variable
inside
b.py
in
both
scenarios
.
This
will
most
probably
not
be
the
same
.
You'd
need
to
set
the
path
to
include
your
c.py's
directory
.
You
can
check
the
PATH
in
main.py
and
if
it
is
correct
there
","
it
would
mean
that
one
of
your
other
imports
is
changing
your
sys.path
ina
way
to
remove
that
.
So
","
I
have
a
directory
structure
:
In
main.py
","
modules
are
dynamically
loaded
at
runtime
","
depending
on
which
modules
are
specified
.
(
This
allows
for
a
hypothetical
c.py
to
be
added
","
main.py
to
be
rerun
","
and
the
program
to
detect
the
addition
of
c.py
and
run
it
.
)
The
problem
is
that
b.py
imports
a
module
installed
via
pip
(
in
a
virtualenv
)
.
(
I'm
going
to
refer
to
it
as
a
library
to
help
avoid
confusion
.
)
When
b.py
is
run
directly
(
python
b.py

the
library
imports
just
fine
.
When
the
shell
is
opened
and
the
library
is
imported
by
hand
","
it
works
.
But
","
when
main.py
is
run
and
b.py
is
dynamically
imported
(
using
pkgutil.iter_modules
to
detect
the
modules

then
importlib.import_module
to
import the
required
ones

the
library
that
b.py
imports
isn't
found
-
an
ImportError
:
No
module
is
thrown
.
To
recap
:
a
module
imports
an
installed
library
","
and
this
works
when
the
module
is
run
directly
or
when
the
library
in
question
is
imported
manually
in
the
python
interpreter
","
but
when
the
module
is
dynamically
imported
","
the
library
isn't
found
.
What
gives
?
I
have
a
model
:
and
I
have
a
form
:
the
min_value
option

I
didn't
want
to
remove
the
ksize

I
needed
it

You

I
am
learning
Artificial
Neural
Network

ANN

recently

have
got
a
code
working
and
running
in
Python
for
the
same

on
mini-batch

I
followed

Deep
Learning
where
there
is

for
the
beginners
.
There
is
also
a
fully
working
code
for
handwritten
digit
recognition
which
works
fine
for
me
too
.
However
","
I
am
trying
to
tweak
the
code
a
bit
by
means
of
passing
the
whole
mini-batch
together
to
train
by
backpropagation
in
the
matrix
form
.
I
have
also
developed
a
working
code
for
that

but
the
code
performs
real
slow
when
run
.
Is
there
any
way
I
can
implement
a
full
matrix
based
approach
to
mini-batch
learning

?
Here

my

from

seconds
to

+
seconds
on
my
machine
.
As
I
am
new
to
python
","
I
use
what
is
readily
available
.
This
snippet
only
requires
numpy
to
run
.
Give
it
a
try
.
What
is
the
most
efficient
way
to
find
the
intersection
of
2
lists
when
both
lists
contain
non-hashables
?
Basically
","
let's
say
I
have
the
following
lists
(
which
I
completely
made
up
)
:
We
can
see
that
the
first
element
of
A
is
the
same
as
the
first
element
of
B
.
I
can
do
the
simple
thing
by
creating
a
for
loop
:
but
I'm
just
wondering
if
there
is
a
more
efficient
","
cooler
","
or
simpler
way
.
For
example
","
there
is
:
...
but
obviously
I
can't
use
set
or
frozenset
for
non-hashables
because
I
get
Is
there
anything
like
this
for
non-hashables
?
Hashing
is
what
makes
the
set
efficient
.
If
you
can't
hash
","
then
you
can't
take
advantage
of
that
efficiency
-
you
have
to
compare
every
object
with
every
other
object
and
you
get
an
O(nÂ²)
algorithm
instead
of
an
amortized
O(n)
one
.
However
","
if
you
care
only
about
object
identity
and
not
equality
","
then
you
can
make
dicts
mapping
the
object
ids
to
the
objects
","
and
take
the
intersection
of
the
ids
:
If
you
want
a
more
code-efficient
solution
or
you
do
care
about
object
equality
","
then
@Neil's
answer
should
suffice
.
A
simple
solution
using
list
comprehension
:
intersection
=
[
element
for
element
in
A
if
element
in
B
checks
if
two
elements
of
the
same
value
are
there
.
For
example
","
for
"[1, 2, 3]"
and
"[0, 1, 5]"
","
it
will
return
[1]
.
Well
","
here's
another
way
.
(
I
assume
x
is
your
original
2d
array
.
)
Still
uses
a
Python
list
generator
expression
","
however
.
I
can't
think
of
any
reason
you
would
need
Instead
of
Which
you
can
get
simply
with
a.T
If
you
really
need
a
list
","
then
you
can
use
list(a.T)
Here
is
one
way
:
Here
is
another
one
:
What
would
be
the
best
way
of
converting
a
2D
numpy
array
into
a
list
of
1D
columns
?
For
instance
","
for
an
array
:
I
would
like
to
get
:
This
works
:
but
I
was
wondering
if
there
is
a
better
solution
using
pure
Numpy
functions
?
I
think
the
error
you
report
can
only
happen
if
nums
is
an
empty
list
.
In
that
situation
","
nums
[
len(nums)
-
1
]
is
not
a
valid
index
(
as
there
are
no
valid
indexes
into
an
empty
list
)
.
For
this
problem
","
there's
really
not
much
point
to
special
casing
the
last
two
items
in
the
list
.
You
can
make
your
code
much
simpler
by
handling
all
the
cases
with
one
loop
:
As
the
comment
says
","
the
loop
body
where
I
use
list
indexes
won't
run
if
the
length
of
the
list
is
less
than
2
.
That's
because
the
range
will
be
empty
","
and
iterating
on
an
empty
sequence
does
nothing
.
A
slightly
fancier
approach
would
be
to
use
zip
on
two
iterators
of
num
that
are
offset
by
one
place
.
This
is
more
advanced
Python
stuff
","
so
if
you
don't
understand
it
yet
","
don't
worry
too
much
about
it
:
This
approach
to
iterating
over
pairs
using
zip
is
inspired
by
the
itertools
documentation
","
where
it's
given
in
the
pairwise
recipe
:
I
need
to
return
True
if
the
array
contains
a
2
next
to
a
2
somewhere
.
But
it
gives
me
an
error
that
"says:""list"
index
out
of
range
""""
.
What
should
i
change
?
I'm
pretty
new
to
the
stuff
","
so
probably
my
code
is
one
of
the
longest
ways
to
solve
it
","
but
i
appreciate
any
help

I
need
some
major
improvements
in
my
programming
/
coding
and
it's
already
been
a
month
of
this
computer
language
field
.
Right
now
I'm
trying
to
create
a
class
with
3
functions
(
lunch
","
breakfast
","
and
dinner
)
and
let's
say
I
want
to
call
the
function
lunch
and
add
'
Strawberry
'
to
the
lunch
list
;
it's
supposed
to
add
1
to
the
list
count
(
list_count
)
for
amount
of
foods
entered
in
the
list
count
so
far
","
and
adds
'
strawberry
'
to
the
dictionary
.
So
what
I'm
trying
to
do
is
I
created
a
blank
dictionary
list
(
lunch_list
)
and
created
a
starting
count
of
food
items
(
lunch_count
)
So
if
I
call
lunch
in
the
Food
class
","
I'm
trying
to
make
the
result
like
this
:
I
was
ready
to
write
this
script
but
after
writing
this
I
confused
myself
a
lot
more
.
I
feel
lost
.
This
is
going
to
be
embarassing
for
me
but
here
is
my
code
:
It
doesn't
seem
like
your
'
Strawberry
'
parameter
matches
the
lunch_count
parameter
in
your
lunch
function
.
In
the
lunch
method
","
you
then
can
increment
it
by
one
every
time
you
call
lunch
","
rather
than
adding
it
as
a
parameter
.
If
you
are
new
to
Python
","
I
would
recommend
Learn
Python
the
Hard
Way
.
Well
this
is
a
bit
silly
","
but
I
tried
a
different
example
and
my
connection
is
working
fine
now
.
Only
difference
I
can
see
is
that
the
second
one
used
HTTPHandler
instead
of
Proxy
","
as
I
have
an
apparently
solution
I'm
not
too
worried
","
but
woudl
still
be
interested
to
know
why
I
had
this
issue
in
the
first
place
.
Your
question
sets
the
proxy
URL
to
http://user:password@http://newyork.wonderproxy.com:11001
which
isn't
valid
.
If
you

You

For

you
can
use

evaluate

what
your

Python

the

You

evaluates

True
if
both
a

0

b

otherwise
it
evaluates

This
evaluates

evaluate

True

otherwise
it
evaluates

False

is
what
you
want

So
pos_neg
automatically
returns
either
True

on
the
specified
inputs

Perhaps
you
were
thinking

testing
each

then
using
an

return

the

True

return
False
if
the

Hi

but
I
think
you're
doing
a
rather
simple
mistake
(
as
indicated
by
gzc
)
:
an
instance
of
class
Bars
is
a
collection
of
bars
from
different
instruments
that
all
have
the
same
timestamp
.
So
","
when
your
onBars
event
is
called
","
you
actually
have
to
loop
through
all
the
instruments
in
the
dictionary
.
The
question
you
are
asking
-
-
about
what
happens
when
-
-
relates
to
events
that
occur
upstream
of
Flask...like
when
gunicorn
starts
up
.
Flask
is
a
Web
Server
Gateway
Interface
(
WSGI
)
application
framework
.
WSGI
is
a
Python-specific
framework
that
defines
how
a
web
server
will
interface
with
an
application
.
(
The
Java
equivalent
is
a
Java
servlet
.
)
The
server
will
use
Python's
WSGI
protocol
to
call
Flask
when
appropriate
.
The
Flask
documentation
on
deploying
a
standalone
WSGI
application
shows
how
to
set
this
up
manually
","
and
gives
you
a
little
insight
into
what's
going
on
upstream
of
Flask
.
The
section
on
Gevent
is
useful
because
it
explicitly
shows
the
import statement
for
yourapplication
and
its
relationship
to
the
HTTP
server
:
The
source
code
for
gunicorn
shows
a
similar
approach
","
loading
the
WSGI
application
once
per
worker
","
and
then
running
indefinitely
.
...
Flask's
application
context
But
you
may
be
searching
for
a
way
to
create
some
new
variable
or
instantiate
a
new
database
connection
or
establish
a
unique
session
cookie
-
-
things
that
should
occur
every
time
a
request
is
processed
","
and
not
just
once
when
the
application
code
is
loaded
.
For
this
","
you
should
look
into
Flask's
application
context
.
From
the
cited
page
:
The
application
context
is
created
and
destroyed
as
necessary
.
It
never
moves
between
threads
and
it
will
not
be
shared
between
requests
.
As
such
it
is
the
perfect
place
to
store
database
connection
information
and
other
things
.
I
would
like
some
information
about
how
the
code
gets
executed
when
a
Flask
application
is
deployed
(
say
","
with
gunicorn
)
.
For
example
","
suppose
I
have
the
following
in
views.py
:
When
does
foo
get
sorted

Only
once
when
the
server
starts
?
Every
time
there's
a
request
?
Something
else
?
The
presence
of
before_first_request
and
before_request
in
the
documentation
seem
to
offer
clues
","
but
I
can't
understand
the
problems
they're
meant
to
solve
until
I
understand
how
exactly
the
code
is
run
on
a
server

Can
you
explain
step-by-step

e.g
.
First
A

spider

be
the
solution

When

you
could
add
arguments
like
scrapy
crawl
some_spider

a
foo=bar
","
and
the
spider
would
receive
the
values
via
its
constructor
","
e.g
.
:
What's
more
","
as
scrapy.Spider
actually
sets
all
additional
arguments
as
instance
attributes

you
don't
even
need
to
explicitly
override
the

just
access
the
.
foo
attribute

I
am
running
a
CrawlSpider

I
want
to
implement
some
logic
to
stop
following
some
of
the
links
in
mid-run
","
by
passing
a
function
to
process_request
.
This
function
uses
the
spider's
class
variables
in
order
to
keep
track

the
current
state
","

depending
on
it

on
the

URL

","
links
get
dropped

continue

be
processed

I
think
that
if
I
were
to
run
several
spiders
on
the
same
machine
","
they
would
all
use
the
same
class
variables

is
not
my
intention

Is
there
a
way
to
add
instance
variables

CrawlSpiders
?
Is
only
a
single
instance
of
the
spider
created

I
run

could
probably
work
around
it

adding

thorough

to
proxying

types
","
but
here's
a
simplified
and
rather
brutish
example
for
the
same
.
I
hope
it
helps
in
understanding
how
to
create
such
forwarding
methods

After
your

the

will
have

the
second

you
try

open
the
dialog

I
find
it
odd
that
you're
doing
all
of
the
initialization
of
your
Dialog
class
outside
of
the
Dialog
class
.
Instead
","
I
would
recommend
moving
the
creation

popLayout
","
and
all
of
the
creation
and
setup
of
table
","
inside
your
Dialog
class
.
This
way
the
layout
gets
created
each
time
the
dialog
is
opened
.
You'll
need
to
add
gameResults
as
a
parameter
to
the
__init__
method
of
Dialog
","
and
you
can
also
remove
the
layout
parameter
you
have
there
at
the
moment

it
isn't
used

After
doing
this
","
your
Dialog
class
should
look

the
following

your
doStuff()

look

the
following

these
changes

was
able

open

leave
it
up

you
to
move
your
main
window
set-up
code

your
Window
class
in
the
same
way

note

have
only
tested
this

time
doStuff

called

there
are
results

first

second

get

=
QHBoxLayout()

start
of
doStuff

I
thought
would
fix
the
problem
gives
me
this

That
doesn't
make
much
sense

me

all

it

can't
find
the
problem

a
lot
of
my
code
could
be
improved
as
well
as
I
am
very
new

classes

If

have
any
tips

open
the

better

other
helpful
tips

it

that
the

The
issue
with
this
is
that
I'd
wish
to
have
a
separate
config
file
for
the
arguments
(
since
its
usually
not
a
single
number

also
be
able
to
use
the

option

Also
","
I
usually
run
multiple
different
sbatch
jobs
simultaneously
(
with
different
configurations
)
","
thus
it
would
be
nice
if
changing
the
configuration
file
does
not
make
the
different
sbatch
runs
get
in
the
way
with
one
another
(
since
if
the
job
gets
queued

then
the
config
file
changes
later

it
will
run
the

recent
config
file

than
the
copy
of
the
config

I
ran
sbatch

.
To
get
around
this
issue
I
discovered
that
when
I
run
a
sbatch
script
","
SLURM
actually
copies
the
submission
script
to
its
internal
database
(
I
disovered
it
after
asking
:
Changing
the
bash
script

to
sbatch
in
slurm
during
run
a
bad
idea
?
)
.
Therefore
","
I
actually
decided
to
hard
code
the
configuration
into
the
bash
submission
script
(
making
the
submission
script
the
config
file
essentially
)
.
That
way
I
just
edit
the
submission
script
and
then
run
the
file
.
However
","
I'd
like
to
stop
this
since
this
makes
me
write
in
bash
which
I
want
to
avoid
at
all
cost
.
Ideally
","
I'd
like
to
run
a
sbatch
that
directly
runs
python
.
Since
this
might
not
be
possible
","
I
wanted
to
know
what
other
options
did
exist
to
solve
this
issue
.
For
example
","
is
it
possible

have
slurm
copy
a
different
file
(
like
a
python
config
file
)
to
its
internal
database
so
that
when
it
queues
the

runs
the
job
that
I
exactly
want
to
run
?
(
notice
that
running
a
sbatch
job

changing
the
config

do
this

since
this
might
cause

do
something

I'm
successfully
able
to
create
import hooks
to

The

I
used

the

this
question
:

;
when

as
this
:

anyone

why

not
work
in

Is
there
something
I
am
missing
?
The
problem
is
that
in
both
of
the
examples
you
point
to
","
load_module()
does
not
add
the
loaded
module
to
sys.modules
.
Normally
","
it
should
do
so
(
and
then
PyPy
works
like
CPython
)
.
If
load_module()
does
not
add
the
module
to
sys.modules
","
then
every
single
import a
will
call
load_module()
again
and
return
a
new
copy
of
the
module
.
For
example
","
in
the
example
from
python:Import
module
from
memory
:
This
is
documented
in
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0302/#id27.
The
load_module()
method
is
responsible
for
doing
more
checks
than
these
simple
examples
show
.
In
particular
","
note
this
line
(
emphasis
in
the
original
)
:
Note
that
the
module
object
must
be
in
sys.modules
before
the
loader
executes
the
module
code
.
So
","
the
fact
that
PyPy
behaves
differently
than
CPython
in
this
case
could
be
understood
as
a
behavior
difference
that
follows
from
code
that
fails
to
respect
the
docs
.
But
anyway
","
my
opinion
is
that
it
should
be
fixed
.
I've
created
an
issue
at
https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2382/sysmeta_path-not-working-like-cpythons.

name
to
retrieve
your
tensor
:
Now
you
want
to
recreate
the
same
scope
and
get
back
a

b
.
For
b
","
you
don't
even
need
to
be
in
the

","
you
just
need
the
exact
name
of
b
.
tf.get_variable()
won't
work
to
get
an
operation
.
Therefore
","
I
would
define
a
new
variable
storing
"tf.maximum(1,2)"
to
retrieve
it
later
:
Note
that
you
need
to
define
b
using
tf.get_variable()
in
order
to
retrieve
it
later
.
My
question
is
related
to
this
Tensorflow
:
How
to
get
a
tensor
by
name
?
I
can
give
names
to
operations
.
But
actually
they
named
differently
.
For
example
:
tf.get_variable
creates
variable
with
exactly
the
same
name
as
I
ask
.
Operations
add
prefixes
to
scope
.
I
want
to
name
my
operation
so
that
I
can
get
it
.
In
my
case
I
want
to
get
b
with
tf.get_variable('b')
in
my
scope
.
How
can
I
do
it
?
I
can't
do
it
with
tf.Variable
because
of
this
issue
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/1325
May
be
I
need
to
set
addition
parameters
to
variable
scope
","
or
to
operation
","
or
somehow
use
tf.get_variable
?
I
want
to
force
a
line
break
after
every
10
numbers
or
9
nine
splits
on
a
txt
file
in
python
?
How
would
I
go
about
this
?
So
say
i
have
int
a
txt.file
and
output
should
be
so
essentially
break
after
every
10
numbers
","
or
9
line
splits
I
have
tried
:
But
this
doesn't
quite
solve
it
.
Also
note
that
the
line
lengths
can
vary
.
So
the
first
line
could
have
5
numbers
and
the
second
line
have
9
and
the
third
10
and
the
fourth
10
How
about
using
[count]
to
count
the

looks
like
everything

one
more

someone
help

I've
a
few
lists
:
slice
is
a
list
of
indices
I
need
to
get
from
slicing
array
.
interval
is
a
list
of
indices
used
to
stop
the
slicing
when
slice
[i]
is
interval
[j]
where
i
and
j
are
looping

.
I
need
to
form
a
list
of

based
on

and
intervals
based
on
the
condition
that
when
slice
[i]
is
not
interval
[j]
here
in
my
case
:
when
slice
[i]
and
interval
[j]
are
equal
for
value
12
.
So
I
need
to
form
a
list
of

from

which
is

when
slice
[i]
is
interval
[j]

intermediate
and
the
slicing
is
continued
.
which
is
now
the
next
value
in
interval
is
17
so
till
we
have
17

form
another
list
from
array
[
slice
[6]

slice
[

+
1

add
this

This
continues

final
output

the
intervals

append
the

because
i

they

alike

i

it

be
more
clear
to
comprehend
this
way

In
the
context
of
Django
","
record
level
operations
are
those
that
on
a
single
records
.
An
example
is
when
you
define
custom
methods
in
a
model
:
Table
level
operations
are
those
that
act

an
example

these
are
when
you
define
a
ModelManager

PS
:
I
took
these
examples
from
django
documentation
.
I
do
not
know
specifically
how
Django
people
use
the
terms
","
but
'
record-level
operation

should
mean
an
operation

1

a
'
table-level
operation

should
mean
an
operation

the
table
as
a
whole
.
I
am
not
quite
sure
what
an
operation
on
all
rows
should
be
-
-
perhaps
both
","
perhaps
it
depends
on
the
result
.
In
Python
","
the
usual
term
for
'
record-level
'
would
be
'
element-wise

.
For
Python
builtins
","
bool
operates
on
collections
:
"bool([0, 1, 0, 3])"
=
True
.
For
numpy
arrays
","
bool
operates
(
at
least
usually
)
on
elements

`
"bool([0, 1, 0, 2])"

Also
compare
"[1,2,3]"

"[1,2,3,1,2,3]"

I
hope
this
helps
.
See
if
it
makes
sense

Here
both
B

C
are
derived
from
A

but
with
different
__init__()
parameters

My
question
is
how
to
write
the
correct

elegant
code
here
to
initialize

the

Maybe
another
question
is--is
it
a
good
coding
practice
to
do
this
variable
setting
in
__init()
__
function
or
it
is
better
to
use
simpler
__init__()
function
","
and
do
set()

seems
not

do

?
Multiple
inheritance
in
Python
requires
that
all
the
classes
cooperate
to
make
it
work
.
In
this
case
","
you
can
make
them
cooperate
by
having
the
__init__
method
in
each
class
accept
arbitrary
*
*
kwargs
and
pass
them
on
when
they
call
super()
.
__init__
.
For
your
example
class
hierarchy
","
you
could
do
something
like
this
:
Note
that
if
you
wanted
D
to
use
the
argument
values
directly
(
rather
than
using
self.a
","
etc.
)
","
you
could
both
take
them
as
named
arguments
and
still
pass
them
on
in
the
super()
call
:
Accepting
and
passing
on
some
args
is
important
if
some
of
the
parent
classes
don't
save
the
arguments
(
in
their
original
form
)
as
attributes
","
but
you
need
those
values
.
You
can
also
use
this
style
of
code
to
pass
on
modified
values
for
some
of
the
arguments
(
e.g
.
with
"super(D, self)"
.
"__init__(a=a, b=b, c1=2*c1, c2=5*c2, **kwargs)"
)
.
This
kind
of
collaborative
multiple
inheritance
with
varying
arguments
is
almost
impossible
to
make
work
using
positional
arguments
.
With
keyword
arguments
though
","
the
order
of
the
names
and
values
in
a
call
doesn't
matter
","
so
it's
easy
to
pass
on
named
arguments
and
*
*
kwargs
at
the
same
time
without
anything
breaking
.
Using
*
args
doesn't
work
as
well
(
though
recent
versions
of
Python
3
are
more
flexible
about
how
you
can
call

*
args
","
such
as
allowing
multiple
unpackings
in
a
single
call
:
"f(*foo, bar, *baz)"
)
.
If
you
were
using
Python
3
(
I'm
assuming
not
","
since
you're
explicitly
passing
arguments

","
you
could
make
the
arguments
to
your
collaborative
functions
""""

would
prevent
users
from
getting
very
mixed
up
and
trying
to
call
your
methods

positional
arguments

Just
put
a
bare

the
argument
list
before
the
other
named
arguments

:
I
want
to
get
a
list
of
three
models
","
where
all
parameters
are
fixed
except
for
C
corresponding
to
the
1
","
10
","
and
100
in
each
model
.
I
have
the
following
two
functions
.
I
then
build
a
model
and
specify
a
dictionary
of
parameters
.
And
generate
the
models
using
the
functions
I
just
defined
.
However
","
the
outcome
is
the
same
model
(
using
the
last
parameter
","
i.e.
100
)
being
repeated
3
times
.
It
seems
there
is
some
aliasing
going
on
.
model
refers
to
the
same
object
throughout
each
iteration
of
the
list
comprehension
in
model_GridSearch
","
so
you're
just
assigning
a
C
value
3
times
to
the
same
object
.
You
can
do
a
few
different
things
to
fix
this
:
you
could
a
copy
of
the
object
using
the
copy
module
","
or
pass
in
the
class
into
the
models_GridSearch
function
instead
of
an
instance
","
and
instantiate
an
object
on
each
iteration
.
You
could
also
refactor
your
code
in
various
ways
to
fix
things
.
It
all
depends
on
your
goals

IMPORTANT
CHANGE
:
The
following
command
also
works

There
must
then
be
an
issue
with

I
run

there
is
an
obvious

here
with
how

the

I've
read
a

about
different
techniques

iterating

it

that
consensus

not
to
iterate

all
(

instance
","
see
a
comment
here

There
are
several
similar
questions
on

my
case

a
bit
different
as
I
have
to
combine
""""
iterating
""""
(
or
not
iterating
)
and
accessing
previous
values
.
Let's
say
there
are
N
(
N
is
small
","
usually
4
","
might
be
up
to
7
)
1-D
numpy
arrays
of
float128
in
a
list
X
","
all
arrays
are
of
the
same
size
.
To
give
you
a
little
insight
","
these
are
data
from
PDE
integration
","
each
array
stands
for
one
function
","
and
I
would
like
to
apply
a
Poincare
section
.
Unfortunately
","
the
algorithm
should
be
both
memory
-
and
time-efficient
since
these
arrays
are
sometimes
~
1Gb
each
","
and
there
are
only
4Gb
of
RAM
on
board
(
I've
just
learnt
about
memmap'ing
of
numpy
arrays
and
now
consider
using
them
instead
of
regular
ones
)
.
One
of
these
arrays
is
used
for
""""
filtering
""""
the
others
","
so
I
start
with
secaxis
=
X.pop(idx)
.
Now
I
have
to
locate
pairs
of
indices
where
(
secaxis
[
i-1
]
>
0
and
secaxis
[i]
<
0
)
or
(
secaxis
[
i-1
]
<
0
and
secaxis
[i]
>
0
)
and
then
apply
simple
algebraic
transformations
to
remaining
arrays
","
X
(
and
save
results
)
.
Worth
mentioning
","
data
shouldn't
be
wasted
during
this
operation
.
There
are
multiple
ways
for
doing
that
","
but
none
of
them
seem
efficient
(
and
elegant
enough
)
to
me
.
One
is
a
C-like
approach
","
where
you
just
iterate
in
a
for-loop
:
This
is
clearly
very
inefficient
and
besides
not
a
Pythonic
way
.
Another
way
is
to
use
numpy.nditer
","
but
I
haven't
figured
out
yet
how
one
accesses
the
previous
value
","
though
it
allows
iterating
over
several
arrays
at
once
:
Third
possibility
is
to
first
find
sought
indices
with
efficient
numpy
slices
","
and
then
use
them
for
bulk
multiplication
/
addition
.
I
prefer
this
one
for
now
:
But
this
is
seemingly
done
in
7
+
2*(N
-
1
)
passes
","
moreover
","
I'm
not
sure
about
secaxis
[inds]
type
of
addressing
(
it
is
not
slicing
and
generally
it
has
to
find
all
elements
by
indices
just
like
in
the
first
method
","
doesn't
it
?
)
.
Finally
","
I've
also
tried
using
itertools
and
it
resulted
in
monstrous
and
obscure
structures
","
which
might
stem
from
the
fact
that
I'm
not
very
familiar
with
functional
programming
:
Not
only
this
looks
very
ugly
","
it
also
takes
an
awful
lot
of
time
to
complete
.
So
","
I
have
following
questions
:
Of
all
these
methods
is
the
third
one
indeed
the
best
?
If
so
","
what
can
be
done
to
impove
the
last
one
?
Are
there
any
other
","
better
ones
yet
?
Out
of
sheer
curiosity
","
is
there
a
way
to
solve
the
problem
using
nditer
?
Finally
","
will
I
be
better
off
using
memmap
versions
of
numpy
arrays
","
or
will
it
probably
slow
things
down
a
lot
?
Maybe
I
should
only
load
secaxis
array
into
RAM
","
keep
others
on
disk
and
use
third
method
?
(
bonus
question
)
List
of
equal
in
length
1-D
numpy
arrays
comes
from
loading
N
.
npy
files
whose
sizes
aren't
known
beforehand
(
but
N
is
)
.
Would
it
be
more
efficient
to
read
one
array
","
then
allocate
memory
for
one
2-D
numpy
array
(
slight
memory
overhead
here
)
and
read
remaining
into
that
2-D
array
?
I'll
need
to
read
your
post
in
more
detail
","
but
will
start
with
some
general
observations
(
from
previous
iteration
questions
)
.
There
isn't
an
efficient
way
of
iterating
over
arrays
in
Python
","
though
there
are
things
that
slow
things
down
.
I
like
to
distinguish
between
the
iteration
mechanism
(
nditer
","
for
x
in
A
:
)
and
the
action
(
alist.append(...)
","
x
[
i+1
]
+
=
1
)
.
The
big
time
consumer
is
usually
the
action
","
done
many
times
","
not
the
iteration
mechanism
itself
.
Letting
numpy
do
the
iteration
in
compiled
code
is
the
fastest
.
is
much
faster
than
The
np.nditer
isn't
any
faster
.
nditer
is
recommended
as
a
general
iteration
tool
in
compiled
code
.
But
its
main
value
lies
in
handling
broadcasting
and
coordinating
the
iteration
over
several
arrays
(
input
/
output
)
.
And
you
need
to
use
buffering
and
c
like
code
to
get
the
best
speed
from
nditer
(
I'll
look
up
a
recent
SO
question
)

Just
judging
from
experience
","
this
approach
will
be
fastest
.
Yes
it's
going
to
iterate
over
secaxis
a
number
of
times
","
but
those
are
all
done
in
compiled
code
","
and
will
be
much
faster
than
any
iteration
in
Python
.
And
the
for
f
in
X
:
iteration
is
just
a
few
times
.
@HYRY
has
explored
alternatives
for
making
the
where
step
faster
.
But
as
you
can
see
the
differences
aren't
that
big
.
Other
possible
tweaks
If
X
was
an
array
","
res
could
be
an
array
as
well
.
But
for
small
N
I
suspect
the
list
res
is
just
as
good
.
Don't
need
to
make
the
arrays
any
bigger
than
necessary
.
The
tweaks
are
minor
","
just
trying
to
avoid
recalculating
things

This
use
of
np.where
is
just
np.nonzero
.
That
actually
makes
two
passes
of
the
array
","
once
with
np.count_nonzero
to
determine
how
many

it

.
And
a
second
loop
to
fill

those

So
multiple

fine

it

simple

I'm
a
Python
beginner
","
I'm
trying
to
study
some
codes
from
some
websites
.
I
found
in
GitHub
an
algorithm
which
does
a
Bruteforce
search
for
arithmetic
expressions
.
The
code
is
:
it
simply
ends
trying
any
arithmetic
expression
using
my
numbers
","
then
prints
the
ones
which
get
the
target
as
result
(
the
result
I
have
)
.
I'm
wondering
","
how
can
I
make
it
print
any
solution
the
script
tried
when
the
expression
doesn't
have
as
result
the
target
I've
set
?
edit
:
This
is
the
code
I
tried
:
I
get
the
actual
product
as
result
","
but
I
get
results
for
small
operations
in
expressions
:
While
I'm
actually
trying
to
get
only
42
at
the
start
of
the
string
.
The
recursion
terminates
by
yielding
str(num[0])
if
num
[0]
equals
target
and
nothing
otherwise
.
If
something
is
yielded
","
the
string
expression
is
built
on
successive
yields
.
To
get
all
expressions
","
something
must
always
be
yielded
.
I
choose
to
also
yield
whether
the
target
was
reached
.
Instead
","
the
expression
could
be
evaluated
before
printing
.
There
is
a
glitch
in
the
original
.
The
product
is
appended
to
the
end
","
but
the
first
number
matching
the
product
from
the
front
is
replaced
.
I
believe
that
the
result
could
be
omission
of
expressions
","
in
which
case
the
algorithm
is
not
complete
.
Since
replace
cannot
be
done
starting
at
the
end
","
the
product
should
be
placed
at
the
front
(
"subnumbers.insert(0, product)"
)
so
that
it
is
the
product
that
gets
replaced
.
I
will
let
you
experiment
with
what
difference
this
makes
.
But
I
believe
the
code
would
have
been
slightly
easier
to
understand
if
written
correctly
.
Put
the
my_list
=
[]
inside
the
outer
loop
to
reinitialize
it
each
time
.
Also
","
if
you
don't
want
the
newline
","
don't
append
it
to
my_list
.
If
you
want
all
the
output
on
the
same
line
use
the
optional
arg
end
to
the
print
function
.
I
agree
with
@Neil
It
looks
like
you
want
a
2d
array
.
Here's
another
way
to
do
it
.
This
will
create
a
0
-
9
number
object
5
to
9
times
.
e.g
[
[
2
","
3
","
4
","
5
...
]
","
[
1
","
2
","
2
","
3
...
]
...
]
Then
you
just
iterate
over
the
object
to
print
it
out
the
way
you
want
UPDATE
Given
the
comment
you
replied
with
here
is
example
of
a
random
number
file
generator
.
If
you
want
more
numbers
on
each
line
format
the
text
inside
the
write
method
.
E.G
This
code
creates
sublists
inside
my_list
","
and
prints
out
each
sublist
every
iteration
.
So
your
output
might
be
something
like
this
:
but
my_list
would
store
all
the
sublists
","
like
this
:
[
"[0, 4, 8]"
","
"[3, 1, 5]"
","
...
","
"[9, 2, 5]"

Thanks

The
reason
that
gameloop

run
is
that
you
have
missed
the
brackets
from
instructionread=instructionread.lower

)
This
means
that
instead
instructionread
being
given
the
value
""""
y
""""
it
gets
the
value
of
a
<
built-in
method
lower
of

object

","
so
the
gameloop
doesn't
run

Note
that
gameloop
has
no
loop
(

the
one
that
goes
ones
through
the
events
)
.
The
procedure
is
run
once
","
and
then
the
program
quits
.
So
","
if
I
input
a
word
""""
tkinter
""""
then
it'll
give
me
the
letter

However
","
if
I
input
""""

k
i
n

How

I

do

My
answer
is
to
use
inheritance
iff
your
classes
are
designed
to
be
inherited
.
Use
composition
in
all
the
other
cases

In
practice
","
this
usually
means
that
if
the
code
that
you
are
extending
exists
in
a
realm
out
of
your
control
","
don't
subclass
it
unless
their
documentation
talks
about
how
you
can
subclass
it
effectively
.
In
this
case
","
since
it
seems
like
you
are
the
author
of
the
class
hierarchy
","
inheritance
seems
to
make
sense
(
though
some
of
your
assertions

D

not
so
easy
to
implement
as
you
have
supposed
since
none
of
the
superclass
__init__

get
called
)
.
You
probably
should
familiarize
yourself
with
the
design
pattern
in
Raymond
Hettinger's
""""
super
considered
super
""""

now
the
implementation
of
D
is
trivially
simple
:
Note
that
we
don't
even
need
to
define
__init__
because
all
of
the
constructors
of
the
super
classes
can
accept
arbitrary
keyword
arguments
.
Instantiating
a
D
looks
like
:
Assume
I
have
a
series
of
classes
as
follows
:
If
now
D

a
both
B

C

it

be
implemented
as

D
can
be
understood
as
a
combination
of
B
and
C
which
seems
a
bit
more
complicated
than
the
multi-inheritance
case
.
Well
","
Now
let's
imaging
class
D2

a
combination
of
5
pieces

B

3
pieces

C

class
D3
is
made
of
D2

an
additional
C(with different parameter than the ones in D)
","

D4
is
made
of
D2
and
2
additional
pieces
of
C(these 2 additional C has same parameter but different from the ones in D2)
.
It
seems
D2
is
good
to
use
composition
","
but
D3
is
good
to
use
inheritance

D2

C

good
to
use
inheritance

the
disadvantage

get
the
parameter
c
or
I
need
to
store
the

c
in
D
directly(besides the one as d.c.c1)

there
any
philosophical
consistent
way

I'm
trying
to
run
a
tensorflow
graph
to
train
a
model
and
periodically
evaluate
using
a
separate
evaluation
dataset
.
Both
training
and
evaluation
data
is
implemented
using
queue
runners
.
My
current
solution
is
to
create
both
inputs
in
the
same
graph
and
use
a
tf.cond
dependent
on
an
is_training
placeholder
.
My
issue
is
highlighted
by
the
following
code
:
I
also
had
to
comment
out
the
image_summary
line
133
of
tensorflow
/
models
/
image
/
cifar10
/
cifar10_inputs.py
.
This
yielded
the
following
results
:
It
would
seem
in
the
mixed
case
both
inputs
are
being
read
/
parsed
","
even
though
only
1
is
used
.
Is
there
a
way
of
avoiding
this
redundant
computation
?
Or
is
there
a
nicer
way
of
switching
between
training
/
evaluation
data
that
still
leverages
the
queue-runner
setup
?
After
some
experimentation
","
my
current
best
solution
is
to
have
a
main
graph
featuring
training
inputs
and
a
separate
graph
with
just
evaluation
data
operations
.
I
open
a
separate
session
to
get
evaluation
data
and
feed
this
to
the
training
graph
when
I
want
to
evaluate
.
Highly
inelegant
(
and
evaluation
runs
take
longer
than
they
ideally
would
as
they
have
to
come
ot
of
one
session
only
to
be
fed
to
another
)
","
but
assuming
evaluation
runs
are
rare
compared
to
training
runs

this
seems
preferable

the
original
version

this
approach

problems

I
find
the
regularization
losses
go
to
infinity

the
DataSupplier
graph
is
on
the
same
device
as
the
training
graph

for
the
life

me
explain
why
this
is
the
case

the

Have
you
read
the
last
section

this

multi
inputs
?
I
think
you
can
add
a
is_training
argument
to
your
input
function
to
distinguish
training
data
from
eval
data
.
Then
you
can
reuse
sharing
variables
to
get
the
logits
for
eval
data

build
a
op
for
eval

run

Since
you
skipped
the

hard

say
what's
wrong
.
But
I
suspect
that
you
just
don't
catch
GET
parameters
correctly
.
To
do
this
you
can
either
use
variable
rules
with
dynamic
name
component
in
your
route

or
access

Why
the

and
how
can
I
fix

The

at

the

ValueError
:

a

        dtype='|S4')"
You're
trying
to
score
your
model
with
precision
and
recall
.
Recall
that
these
scoring
methods
are
formulated
in
terms
of
true
positives
","
false
positives
","
and
false
negatives
.
But
how
does
sklearn
know
what
is
positive
and
what
is
negative
?
Is
it
'
ham
'
or
'
spam
'
?
We
need
a
way
to
tell
sklearn
that
we
consider
'
spam
'
the
positive
label
and
'
ham
'
the
negative
label
.
According
to
the
sklearn
documentation
","
the
precision
and
recall
scorers
by
default
expect
a
positive
label
of
1
","
hence
the
pos_label=1
part
of
the
error
message
.
There
are
at
least
3
ways
to
go
about
fixing
this
.
1
.
Encode
'
ham
'
and
'
spam
'
values
as
0
and
1
directly
from
the
data
source
in
order
to
accommodate
the
precision
/
recall
scorers
:
2
.
Use
sklearn's
built-in
function
(
label_binarize
)
to
transform
the
categorical
data
into
encoded
integers
in
order
to
accommodate
precision
/
recall
scorers
:
This
will
transform
your
categorical
data
to
integers
.
3
.
Create
scorer
objects
with
custom
arguments
for
pos_label
:
As
the
documentation
says
","
the
precision
and
recall
scores
by
default
have
a
pos_label
argument
of
1
","
but
this
can
be
changed
to
inform
the
scorer
which
string
represents
the
positive
label
.
You
can
construct
scorer
objects
that
have
different
arguments
with
make_scorer
.
After
making
any
of
these
changes
to
your
code
","
I'm
getting
average
precision
and
recall
scores
of
around
0.990
and
0.704
","
consistent
with
the
book's
numbers
.
Of
all
the
3
options
","
I
recommend
#
3
the
most
because
it
is
harder

What
could

the
problem

The

in
case
anyone
wants

try

subprocess.run
was
added
in
Python
3.5
as
a
simplification

you

do
anything
else
meanwhile
.
For
other
cases
","
you
still
need
to
use
subprocess.Popen
.
The
main
difference
is
that
subprocess.run
executes
a
command
and
waits
for
it
to
finish
","
while
with
subprocess.Popen
you
can
continue
doing
your
stuff

the

finishes
and
then
just
repeatedly
call
subprocess.communicate
yourself
to
pass
and
receive
data
to
your
process
.
Note
that
","
what
subprocess.run
is
actually
doing
is
invoking
for
you
the
Popen
and
communicate

so
you
don't
need
to
make
a
loop

pass

receive
data
nor
wait
for
the
process
to
finish

Check
this
site
for
the
information
of
which
parameters
of
subprocess.run
are
passed
to
Popen
and
which
to
communicate
.
I'm
new
to
the
subprocess
module
and
the
ducumentation
leaves
me
wondering
what
the
difference
is
between
subprocess.popen
and
subprocess.run
.
Is
there
a
difference
in
what
the
command
does
?
Is
one
just
newer
?
Which
is
better
to
use
?
There
are
couple
of
issues
with
the
code
.
First
since
you're
using
long
I
guess
you're
running
it
on
Python
2
.
On
Python
2
range
will
generate
a
list
and
you'll
run
out
of
memory
since
problem
description
states
that
max
N
is
10^9
.
You
could
fix
that
problem
by
switching
to
xrange
that
returns
xrange
object
instead
.
If
you
make
the
change
described
above
the
second
issue
would
be
speed
.
Since
max
N
is
10^5
you'd
potentially
have
to
iterate
over
10^14
numbers
which
takes
far
too
long
.

You
have
to
use
:
instead
of

How
do
you
select
python
Tuple
/
Dictionary
values
where
the
index
is
greater
than
some
number
.
I
would
think
the
code
should
look
similar
to
the
following
assuming
we
create
a
Tuple
:
dt
=
(
100
","
200
","
300
","
400
)
dt
[
dt.index
>
1
]
You
could
just
slice
the
tuple
.
recently
I
have
been
trying
to
make
a
spin-off
of
Collatz
conjecture
using
python
3.0
.
The
program
works
as
it
should
with
positive
integers
","
but
it
will
not
work
with
negative
integers
.
In
the
program
I
check
if
the
number
is
negative
and
if
so
I
square
it
","
and
then
proceed
with
collatz
","
rules
.
Unfortuanitly
it
gives
off
no
error
messages
.
Code
below
:
feel
free
to
try
out
my
code
","
it
only
uses
python
3
and

In
the
mapping
used
by
the
Collatz
conjecture
","
a
positive
value
always
maps
to
another
positive
value
.
So
you
only
need
to
check
for
negative
values
as
part
of
your
initialisation
:
The
loop
while
not
number
!
=
1
:
can
be
deleted
.
It
will
only
run
if
number
is
equal
to
1
(
there
is
a
double
negative
)
.
If
you
enter
1
","
this
loop
will
run
once
","
assign
3*1+1
to
number
","
and
then
the
second
loop
will
start
.
In
other
words
","
this
loop
is
pointless
:
delete
it
.
Note
the
line
number
*
*
2
will
not
change
the
value
of
number
","
since
there
is
no
assignment
.
The
problem
is
that
x
is
not
an
integer
","
it
is
a
string
.
In
this
case
you
are
asking
Python
to
count
up
to
something
which
","
as
far
as
Python
is
concerned
","
has
no
numerical
value
.
Adding
an
int()
statement
and
printing
the
correct
thing
should
do
the
trick
.
Sorry
","
but
everything
.
For
the
sake
of
time
here's
the
code
they
want
:
EDIT
:
Problems
with
your
code
:
You
don't
convert

Can
someone
tell
me
how
to
rotate
only
part

an

this

How
to
find
coordinate
/
center
of
this
image
:
i
can
rotate
all
pict
using
this
You
can
solve
this
problem
as
such
.
Say
you
have
img
=
"Image.open(""nime1.png"")"
Create
a
copy
of
the
image
using
img2
=
img.copy()
Create
a
crop
of
img2
at
the
desired
location
using
img2.crop()
.
You
can
read
how
to
do
this
here
Paste
img2
back
onto
img
at
the
appropriate
location
using
img.paste()
Notes
:
To
find
the
center
coordinate
","
you
can
divide
the
width
and
height
by
2
:
)
You
can
crop
an
area
of
the
picture
as
a
new
variable
.
In
this
case
","
I
cropped
a
120x120
pixel
box
out
of
the
original
image
.
It
is
rotated
by
90
and
then
pasted
back
on
the
original
.
So
I
thought
about
this
a
bit
more
and
crafted
a
function
that
applies
a
circular
mask
to
the
cropped
image
before
rotations
.
This
allows
an
arbitrary
angle
without
weird
effects
.
Another
way
to
get
list
of
"[long, lat]"
without
list
comprehension
:
If
you
would
like
list
of
tuples
instead
:
If
you
want
to
convert
to
floats
too
:
The
direct
translation
of
your
code
into
a
list
comprehension
is
:
The
obSet
[
'
total_results
'
]
is
informative
but
not
needed
","
you
could
just
loop
over
obSet
[
'
results
'
]
directly
and
use
each
resulting
dictionary
:
Now
you
have
a
list
of
strings
however
","
as
each
'
location
'
is
still
the
long
","
lat
formatted
string
you
printed
before
.
Split
that
string
and
convert
the
result
into
a
sequence
of
floats
:
Now
you
have
a
list
of
lists
with
floating
point
values
:
If
you
must
have
tuples
rather
than
lists
","
add
a
tuple()
call
:
The
latter
also
makes
sure
the
expression
works
in
Python
3
(
where
map()
returns
an
iterator
","
not
a
list
)
;
you'd
otherwise
have
to
use
a
nested
list
comprehension
:
You
can
iterate
over
the
list
of
results
directly
:
This
will
return
a
list
of
tuple
","
elements
of
the
tuples
are
unicode
.
If
you
want
that
the
elements
of
tuples
as
floats
","
do
the
following
:
To
correct
way
to
get
a
list
of
tuples
using
list
comprehensions
would
be
:
You
can
of
course
replace
to_tuple()
with
a
lambda
function
","
I
just
wanted
to
make
the
example
clear
.
Moreover
","
you
could
use
map()
to
have
a
tuple
with
floats
instead
of
string
:
return
"tuple(map(float,coords_str.split(',')"
)
)
.
obSet
[
'
results
'
]
is
a
list
","
no
need
to
use
range
to
iterate
over
it
:
To
make
this
into
list
comprehension
you
can
write
:
But
","
each
location
is
coded
as
a
string
","
instead
of
list
or
tuple
of
floats
.
To
get
it
to
the
proper
format
","
use
That
is
","
split
the
item
[
'
location
'
]
string
into
parts
using
","
as
the
delimiter
","
then
convert
each
part
into
a
float
","
and
make
a
tuple
of
these
float
coordinates
.
Let's
try
to
give
this
a
shot
","
starting
with
just
1
location
:
>
>
>
(
long
","
lat
)
=
obSet
[
'
results
'
]
[0]
[
'
location
'
]
Alright
","
so
that
didn't
work
","
but
why
?
It's
because
the
longitude
and
latitude
coordinates
are
just
1
string
","
so
you
can't
unpack
it
immediately
as
a
tuple
.
We
must
first
separate
it
into
two
different
strings
.
>
>
>
(
long
","
lat
)
=
obSet
[
'
results
'
]
[0]
[
'
location
'
]
.
"split("","")"
From
here
we
will
want
to
iterate
through
the
whole
set
of
results
","
which
we
know
are
indexed
from
0
to
n
.
"tuple(obSet['results'][i]['location'].split("","")"
)
will
give
us
the
tuple
of
longitude
","
latitude
for
the
result
at
index
i
","
so
:
>
>
>
[
"tuple(obSet['results'][i]['location'].split("","")"
)
for
i
in
range(n)
]
ought
to
give
us
the
set
of
tuples
we
want
.

use

urllib.parse.parse_qs
.
Depending
on
the
library
you
are
using
","
there
might
be
a
convenience
method
to
access
the
data
as
well
","
as
this
is
a
common
use
case
.
Say
you
had
a
list
","
for
example
:
And
you
had
the
following
list
:
How
would
you
create
a
function
that
simply
re-orders
the
second
list
based
on
the
total
number
of
times
an
element
from
the
entire
first
list
matches
any
part
of
an
individual
string
from
the
second
list
?
For
further
clarity
:
in
the
second
list
the
'
a
'
string
would
contain
1
match
the
'
a
b
c
'
string
would
contain
3
matches
the
second
example
list
would
essentially
end
up
in
reverse
order
once
the
function
has
finished
My
attempt
:
Here's
one
unstable
way
to
do
it
:
If
stable
sort
is
required
you
could
leverage
enumerate
:
Above
generates
tuples
where
second
item
is
a
string
from
l2
and
first
item
is
the
count
of
matches
from
l1
:
Then
those
tuples
are
sorted
to
descending
order
:
And
finally
only
the
strings
are
taken
:
In
the
second
version
tuples
have
reverse
index
to
ensure
stability
:
Similar
answer
:
The
most
straightforward
approach
would
be
to
use
the
key
parameter
of
the
sorted
built-in
function
:
The
key
function
is
called
once
per
item
in
the
list
to
be
sorted
.
Still
this
is
inefficient
since
count
takes
linear
time
.
I
have
multiple
CSV
files
in
a
directory
.
Some
contain
more
columns
(
which
would
be
OK
to
drop
)
.
Is
there
an
elegant
way
to
deduplicate
records
between
these
CSV
files
and
reduce
columns
to
a
common
set
of
columns
?
Currently
","
I
will
use
python
/
pandas
to
accomplish
this
.
I
will
load
all
the
files
into
a
single
data
frame
","
note
in
an
additional
column
where
the
records
originated
from
(
filename
)
","
drop
the
additional
columns
and
finally
have
pandas
deduplicate
via
http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.duplicated.html
In
the
last
step
","
I
write
the
deduplicated
files
back
to
disk
based
on
the
filename-identifier
column
.
Is
there
a
simpler
approach
to
this
?
I
do
not
known
how
to
make
it
simpler
.
I
have
an
equal
script
done
for
some
data
of
mine
.
It
just
runs
twice
","
first
to
determine
the
min
/
max
cols
in
all
documents
and
finally
to
rewrite
the
csv
files
in
an
new
folder
","
to
keep
the
original
data
.
I
am
just
using
the
csv
lib
from
python
.
https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html
There
are
no
checks
in
this
script
","
as
it's
just
a
quick
and
dirty
script
.
The
deduplication
is
not
done
.
It
just
cuts
all
data
to
the
same
length
","
but
you
can
replace
the
last
line
with
your
deduplication
code
.
No
","
it's
not
a
bug
.
When
you

you've

give

To
explain

Heroku
works

This
can
be
treated
as
a
binary
text
classification
problem
.
You
should
collect
documents
that
contain
'
adult-content
'
as
well
as
documents
that
do
not
contain

It
may
so
happen
that
a
word
/
phrase
that
you
have
included
in
the
list
arrBad
may
be
present

She
wanted
to
be
the
first

You
need
to
get
a

occurs
in
a
'
adult-content
'
document

a
'
universal
'
document
.
I'd
suggest
you
consider
using
algorithms

Naive
Bayes
(
which
should
work
fairly
well
in

case

if

you
could
consider
the
Support

algorithm
as
well
(
but
that
would
involve
tweaking
a
lot

complex
parameters

I
would
approach
this

a
Text

using
blacklists
of
words
typically
does
not
work
very
well
to
classify
full

The
main
reason
why
blacklists
don't
work
is
that
you
will
have
a
lot
of
false
positives
(
one
example
:
your
list
contains
the
word
'
sexy

which
alone
isn't
enough
to
flag
a
document
as
being

adults

To
do
so
you
need
a

documents

""""

others
""""

PROBLEM
SOLVED
I

solved

just
unindenting
this
part

added

I'm
trying

2.7
the
final
touch
is
simpler
:
Consider
two
lists
A

know
that

B

What
about
the
situation
whereby
elements
in
both
A
and
B
are
lists

i.e.
A

B
are

Use
str.startswith

boolean
indexing

Another
solution
with
str.contains
:
Last
solution
with
filter
:
I
have
a
large
database

I

can

You
may
unwrap
the
string
in
variable
for
each
feature
as
:
Now
","
you
may
check
for
each
feature
as
:
I
guess
you
could
do
something
like
:
Where
using
:
reversed
-
because
bits
are
read
from
LSB
to
MSB
so
we
need
to
iterate
from
right
to
left
.
enumerate
-
because
we
want
to
get
the
associated
index
to
check
in
our
mapping
what
is
the
feature
name
/
attributes

""""
""""

join(bits)
-
because
we

join
all
the
items
on
the
list
to
one
iterable
object
we
can
go
through
.
The
solution
depends
on
your
way
to
enumerate
the
features
.
if
you
enumerate
your
features
from
0
to
63
it
would
be
something
like
this
:
However
","
you
can
easily
adjust
this
method
to
match
other
enumerations
.
I
have
a
list
of
64
bits
.
Here
each
and
every
bit
represents
a
feature
.
If
a
bit
is
1
then
that
particular
feature
is
supported
else
not
.
Is
there
any
way
were
i
can
check
the
bit
and
just
return
its
associated
feature
if
it
is
1
.
Input
:
1111111
Output
:
If
all
bits
are
one
then
I
need
to
print
all
eight
features
masked
in
it
.
You
can
make
a
list
of
features
first
.
Then
make
a
function
.
Then
use
a
loop
to
get
features
for
each
bit
string
.
Note
that
","
it
is
not
very
efficient

it
is
verbose

a

don't

You

Use

Any

TrivialClass
or
a
subclass
that
is
still
an
ancestor

The

argument
specifies
that
T
has

subclass

TrivialClass
;
because
the
class
doesn't

See
the
Annotating
instance
and
class
methods
section
of
PEP
484
.
Note
:
The
first
revision
of
this
answer
advocated
using
a
forward
reference
naming
the
class
itself
as
the
return
value
","
but
issue
1212
made
it
possible

a
better
solution
.
Given
a
class
with
a
helper
method
for
initialization
:
Is
it
possible
to
annotate
the
return
type
of
the
from_int
method
?
I'v
tried
both
cls
and
TrivialClass
but
PyCharm
flags
them

unresolved

sounds
reasonable
at

in

I
have
this
code
which
scrapes
usernames
:
When
it
starts
putting
all
the
names
in
a
list
like
this
After
an
hour

memory
allocation
errors

obviously
I
know
why
this
happens
but
how
can
I
fix
it
?
I
was
thinking
just
getting
the
usernames
from
a
single
page
and
output
them
to
file
immediately
","
delete
contents
of
list
","
repeat
","
but
I
didn't
know
how
to
implement
this
.
You
can
use
Python
Resource
Library
to
increase
your
process
allocated
memory
as
threads
of
a
process
use
memory
of
their
parent
process
they
cannot
allocate
extra
memory
.
The
code
you
use
keeps
all
the
downloaded
documents
in
memory
for
two
reasons
:
you
return
a.string
","
which
is
not
just
a
str
but
a
bs4.element.NavigableString
and
as
such
keeps
a
reference
to
its
parent
and
ultimately
to
the
whole
document
tree
.
you
return
a
generator
expression
","
which
will
capture
the
local
context
(
in
this
case
the
soup
)
until
it
is
used
.
One
way
to
fix
this
would
be
to
use
:
This
way
no
references
to
the
soup
objects
are
kept
","
and
the
expression
is
executed
immediately
and
a
list
of
strs
returned
.
As
this
answer
suggests
you
have
to
use
I
want
to
do
an
automation

Internet

navigate
to
login.live.com
and
set
a
value
into
the
email
textbox
.
Here's
the
simple
script
:
The
last
line
always
returns
the
following
TypeError
:
getElementById()
takes
exactly
1
argument
(
2
given
)
When
I
try
to
add
the
value
through
the
console
of
the
Internet
Explorer
it
works
.
Btw
.
the
getElementsByTagName()
method
works
without
any
Errors
.

for
any
help

Okay
.
.
I
wrote

also
my
question

The

is
called
by
the
string_mod

return

auth-4|duration:144.59
auth-9|duration:154.92

133.92

bigger

132.72
","

less

144.59

154.92

sorry

unclear
explained

So
a

return
the
last
place

is
4

(
index+1

You
could
use

I
would
like
to
understand
how
to
reprint
multiple
lines
in
Python
3.5
.
This
is
an
example
of
a
script
where
I
would
like
to
refresh
the
printed
statement
in
place
.
What
I
am
trying
to
do
is
have
:
Write

refresh

The
values

effectively
giving
me
a

update

I
saw
another
question
from
5
years

with

addition
of
the
end

in
Python
3
+
print
function
","
I
am
hoping
that
there
is
a
much
simpler
solution
.
If
you
want
to
clear
the
screen
each
time
you
call
print()
","
so
that
it
appears
the
print
is
overwritten
each
time
","
you
can
use
clear
in
unix
or
cls
in
windows
","
for
example
:
If
I've
understood
correctly
you're
looking
for
this
type
of
solution
:
This
solution
won't
work
with
some
software
like
IDLE
","
Sublime
Text
","
Eclipse
...
The
problem
with
running
it
within
this
type
of
software
is
that
clear
/
cls
uses
ANSI
escape
sequences
to
clear
the
screen
.
These
commands
write
a
string
such
as
""""
\
033
[
[
80;j
""""
to
the
output
buffer
.
The
native
command
prompt
is
able
to
interpret
this
as
a
command
to
clear
the
screen
but
these
pseudo-terminals
don't
know
how
to
interpret
it
","
so
they
just
end
up
printing
small
square
as
if
printing
an
unknown
character
.
If
you're
using
this
type
of
software
","
one
hack
around
could
be
doing
print('\n' * 100)
","
it
won't
be
the
optimal
solution
but
it's
better
than
nothing

approach

this

toy

timings

If

these

around

is
a
version

it's
easier
to
remember

play
with
this
'
i

dtype

So
this
works

it

much
slower

discussed

np.in1d

several

query
","
then
return
a
JSON
response
based
on
the
results
of
the
query
.
I
ran
a
base
test
of
1
concurrent
request
for
10
requests
","
and
I
got
an
average
response
time
of
60
milliseconds
.
Running
another
test
with
10
concurrent
requests
for
100
requests
returned
an
average
of
150ms
","
100
concurrent
requests
for
1000
returned
1500ms
and
500
concurrent
requests
returned
around
7000-9000ms
.
The
latency
seems
to
be
linearly
increasing
which
makes
sense
","
but
it
seemed
to
increase
TOO
quickly
.
After
doing
a
lot
of
tinkering
and
profiling
","
I
found
that
the
bottleneck
was
the
queries
.
At
the
start
of
the
benchmark
","
the
queries
would
process
and
return
quickly
under
10-50ms
","
but
it
quickly
increased
and
in
some
cases
latencies
of
10000-15000
ms
were
being
seen
.
I
couldn't
figure
out
why
the
db
was
slowing
down
so
much
especially
since
it
is
empty
(
barring
test
data
)
.
I
tried
running
the
application
WITHOUT
a
connection
pool
","
and
the
results
showed
that
latency
went
down
(
7-9s
to
5-6s
)
.
I
did
not
think
this
was
possible
because
everything
I
read
suggested
having
a
connection
pool
will
always
make
things
faster
because
you
avoid
the
overhead
of
establishing
a
new
connection
every
time
you
make
a
request
.
I
also
experimented
with
INCREASING
the
connection
pool
size
(
from
the
default
5
to
50
)
","
and
that
decreased
latency
even
more
than
the
pool-less
setup(5-6s to 3-4s)
.
The
latency
is
still
extremely
high
(
3-4
seconds
for
an
API
seems
unreasonable
by
any
standard
)
","
and
I
am
trying
to
figure
out
how
I
can
decrease
it
even
more
.
Is
the
answer
just
more
connections
?
Note
:
I
am
running
4
uWSGI
processes
with
100
threads
each
on
a
server
with
4GB
ram
and
a
quad
core
processor
.
I
am
using
the
psycopg2-cffi
adapter
for
the
connection
","
and
the
application
is
running
on
PyPy
.
The
linear
increase
is
very
much
normal
","
if
the
database
has
to
process
your
queries
sequentially
.
Essentially
","
all
concurrent
requests
get
started
at
the
same
time
","
but
finish
one
after
another
","
so
","
assuming
a
pool
with
a
single
connection
","
60ms
per
request
","
and
10
concurrent
requests
","
you're
going
to
see
requests
taking
60ms
","
120ms
","
180ms
","
240ms
","
300ms
","
360ms
","
420ms
","
480ms
","
540ms
","

","
600ms
","
...
","
600ms
","
540ms
","
480ms
","
...
.
We
can
calculate
how
much
time
it
takes
for
the
average
request
","
given
n
requests
and
m
concurrent
requests
:
These
numbers
are
similar
to
what
you
are
seeing
.
Now
comes
the
big
question
.
Why
does
the
database
process
queries
almost
sequentially
?
I
can
think
of
a
few
reasons
:
Locking
:
each
started
transaction
needs
to
lock
some
resource
exclusively
so
only
one
(
or
few
)
transaction
can
run
at
a
time
CPU-bound
query
:
each
transaction
takes
significant
CPU
resources
so
other
transactions
must
wait
for
CPU
time
Large
table
scans
:
the
database
cannot
keep
the
entirety
of
the
table
in
memory
and
therefore
must
read
from
disk
for
every
transaction
How
do
you
fix
this
?
This
is
a
complicated
question
","
but
a
few
potential
solutions
:
Optimize
your
queries
;
either
optimize
it
so
that
they
don't
all
fight
for
the
same
resource
","
or
","
optimize
it
so
that
they
don't
take
as
long
Batch
your
queries
so
that
you
need
to
run
fewer
in
total
Cache
your
responses
so
that
they
don't
hit
the
database
at
all
So
currently
I
have
something
like
this
:
Model
:
Admin
:
I
create
these
objects
in
code
-
meaning
I
set
the
report
object
.
But
what
I
would
like
in
the
Django
admin
is
if
I
could
allow
a
user
to
edit
that
report
object
but
only
the
one
set
.
They
would
be
allowed
to
change
it
(
so
hopefully
the
drop
down
menu
would
no
longer
be
there
)
so
the
nice
pencil
icon
would
still
be
there
","
but
things
like
that
""""
+
""""
icon
would
be
gone
.
And
this
is
not
to
say
the
user
can't
edit
all
reports
","
it's
just
that
in
the
ConfirmEmail
Admin
they
can
only
view
that
specific
report
attached
to
it
.
I've
been
smacking
away
at
this
and
can't
seem
to
get
it
work
.
I
would
also
be
inclined
to
just
have
the
current
Report
Form
embedded
into
the
ConfirmEmail
form
-
but
don't
know
how
I
would
go
about
doing
that
.
You
should
first
introduce
a
model
admin
for
your
Report
model
","
then
override
the
has_add_permission
function
of
your
ReportAdmin
.
You
can
also
remove
/
disable
the
+
button
using
javascript
in
the
page
","
but
be
aware
that
the
user
can
cause
damage
if
he
knows
the
add
url
","
or
disables
javascript
.
According
to
the
docs
on
rect
:
The
Rect
object
has
several
virtual
attributes
which
can
be
used
to
move
and
align
the
Rect
:
x
","
y
top
","
left
","
bottom
","
right
topleft
","
bottomleft
","
topright
","
bottomright
midtop
","

","
midbottom
","
midright
center
","
centerx
","
centery
size
","
width
","
height
w
","
h
I've
bolded
center
.
I
was
looking
through
a
pygame
tutorial
and
encountered
the
following
part
of
a
script
:
The
last
line
set
the
center
of
the
rect
at
(
200.150
)
I
looked
through
the
pygame
documentation
and
there
is
no
center
attribute
in
the
Rect
class
.
But
the
script
works
...
why
?
Consider
True
is
1
and
0
is
False
.
Since
a
is
set
to
False
(
a=False
in
first
statement
of
code
)
","
the
first
part
'
a==True
'
i.e.
0
=
=
1
will
return
0
(
False
)
.
Then
remaining
will
be
False
or
True
since
'
a==True
'
is
False
.
So
it
will
be
like
0
or
1
(
False
or
True
)
.
We
know
that
0
AND
0
=
0
1
AND
0
=
0
1
AND
1
=
1
0
OR
0
=
0
0
OR
1
=
1
1
OR
1
=
1
So
in
your
case
","
0
OR
1
will
result
to
1
i.e.
True
.

Basically
I'm
trying

take
the
print

make

a

tried

argument
of
str()
.
str()
expects
one
object
to
be
converted
","
and
*
x
gives
5

Try
this
:
This
will
go
through
the
list
and
join
each
element
together
with
an
underscore

Try
it
on
IDEOne
You
can
also
use
"map(function, sequence)"
to
shorten
the
join()

The
function

is
str()

convert
the
numbers
into
string
form
","
and
to
the
x
list
.
Here's
with
map()
:
You
can
convert
the
list
of
ints

a
list
of
strings

use
join

not
work

print
does
some
work

you

All
non-keyword

are
converted

str()
does

So
","
print
did
the

with
two
optional

encoding

By
calling
"str(*x, sep='_')"

you
are
passing

5

a

Can
anybody
help
me

The
reason
you
see
only
the
first
character
is
that
by
calling
c_char()
you
create
a
single
char
value
that
Python
treats
like
a
str
(
Python
2
)
object
or
bytes
(
Python
3
)
object
of
length
1
.
You
are
probably
lucky
that
you
do
not
get
a
segmentation
fault

By
writing
more
than
1
byte
or
a
NULL-terminated
string
of
length
>
0
(
e.g
.
with
strcpy
)
in
the
C
code
","
you
actually
produce
an
undetected
buffer
overflow
.
ctypes
does
not
know
how
many
bytes
you
have
written
at
the
pointer's
memory
location
.
path.value
is
still
a
str
/
bytes
of
length
1
.
It
would
be
better
to
change
the
C
pathinfo
function
into
someting
like
Use
ctypes.create_string_buffer()
to
allocate
memory
in
your
Python
code
and
let
pathinfo
return
the
length
of
the
result
.
Of
course
you
have
to
check
","
whether
char
*
path
is
large
enough
using
bsize
in
your
C-Code
.
The
Python-code
would
look

this

(
such
as
library
modules
which
were
imported
and
used
within
the
module
)
.
One
important
thing
to
note
here
is
-
Imports
without
*
are
not
affected
by
__all__
i.e.
Members
that
are
not
mentioned
in
__all__
are
accessible
from
outside
the
module
using
direct
import
-
from
<
module
>
import
<
member
>
.
An
Example
:
the
following
code
in
a
module.py
explicitly
exports
the
symbols
foo
and
bar
:
These
symbols
can
then
be
imported
like
so
:
If
you
define
__all__
","
then
only
the
attributes
mentioned
there
will
be
imported
via
*
","
while
the
excluded
ones
have
to
be
imported
explicitly
.
So
either
use
or
if
you
really
want
to
use
the
(
discouraged
!
)
from
package
import
*
","
declare
in
package
.
Note
how
tedious
it
will
become
to
keep
this
up-to-date
...
If
a
module
package
defines
__all__
","
it
is
the
list
of
module
names
that
are
imported
by
from
package
import
*
So
if
you
define
__all__
as
empty
list
","
from
package
import
*
will
import nothing
.
Try
defining
it
like
this
:
Also
note
that
you
don't
have
to
do
from
package
import
*
to
use
sub_module
You
can
also
just
do

Python
documentation
says

package
when

This
also
works

__all__

defined
.

a
little
bit
of
code

represent

trying
to
do
:
The
idea
is
that
it
would
have
the
console
output
...
since
it
is
changing
the
global
x
variable
by
adding
one
to
it
.
But
instead
it
is
creating
a
new
global
variable
called
x
","
and
setting
it's
value
to
1
every
time
I
run
the
variableChanger()
function
","
and
I
just
end
up
with
...
What
I
want
to
do
is
access
the
variable
x
that's
at
the
top
of
the
code
and
increment
that
","
so
that
whenever
and
wherever
I
access
it
later
","
it
has
the
incremented
value
.
Is
there
a
way
to
do
that
?

My
justification

why
this
change

valid

in

pull

If

wont

worry

sum

I
think
it

since
the

never
predict
something

Note
:
According
to
the
roc_curve
documentation
","
it
is
clearly
stated
that
thresholds
[0]
represents
no
instances
being
predicted
and
is
arbitrarily
set
to
max(pred)
+
1
.
[
Here
","
2
for
binary
classification
task
]
This
becomes
valid
when
the
fpr
and
tpr
when
calculated
becomes
a
fraction
and
cannot
be
quantified
to
0
or
1
.
Hence
","
the
threshold
varies
from
0
","
1
","
2
.
For
eg
","
when
the
last
2
values
of
pred
array
become
1
","
you
get
3
values
for
threshold
as
fpr
and
tpr
become
fractional
values
.
But
in
our
case
","
both
fpr
and
tpr
had
been
either
of
0
or
1
and
hence
there
wasn't
any
need
for
a
third
value
of
the
threshold
.
Also
","
the
array
elements
in
both
fpr
and
tpr
form
an
increasing
sequence
","
i.e
vary
from
0
→
1
and
must
satisfy
a
shape
>
=
2
.
Therefore
","
it
is
mandatory
to
have
both
0's
and
1's
in
the
array
as
the
starting
and
terminal
values
.
Incase
of
fractional
values
of
fpr
and
tpr
","
the
middle
column
would
contain
these
values
enclosed

Simply
test

As
others
have
pointed
out
","
your
array

the

But
let's
use
the
feature
that
slicing
won't
raise
an
exception
","
that
is
:
In
the
above
example
I
took
a
slice

the
beginning
of
the
array
up

the

","

didn't
get

Python

Thus
","
you
could
do
the
check
as
simply
as
:
and
that's
all
!
Easier
solution
for
this
problem
would
be
:
If
you
want
to
check
for
9
","
even
if
the
list
length
is
less
than
4
","
then
below
is
the
solution
:
It
is
given
in
the
problem
that
the
array
length
may
be
less
than
4
.
Your
are
just
iterating
over
an
array
.
You
should
first
check
whether
the
array
is
at
least
of
length
4
.
If
the
array
is
less
than
4
then
only
iterate
through
the
length
of
the
array
.
You
use
range(4)
.
So
it
will
always
look
for
4
numbers
.
So
when
there
are
only
three
numbers
it
will
still
look
for
a
fourth
one
.
The
fourth
one
doesn't
exist
so
it
throws
an
error
.
Instead
you
need
to
see
what
the
lenght
of
the
list
is
and
then
iterate
over
that
lenght
.
Like
this
:
Or
even
simpler
you
can
iterate
over
a
list
like
this
:
You
have
to
get
the
minimum
checking
length
of
the
input
list
:
The
problem
is
""""
check
the
first
four
numbers
of
a
list
","
to
see
if
any
of
them
is
a
9
""""
.
Now
","
if
the
list
is
less
than
4
","
then
automatically
the
check
will
fail
:
Next
","
you
need
to
check
if
the
first
four
items
contain
nine
.
There
are
many
ways
to
do
this
","
one
of
the
easiest
is
:
Combine
the
two
:
The
issue
with
your
initial
approach
is
you
are
forcing
the
length
to
be
4
","
and
assuming
that
at
minimum
the
array
will
have
4
elements
.
If
the
array
has
3
elements
","
then
your
code
will
not
work
.
To
avoid
this
","
don't
assume
a
specific
length
.
If
you
use
slicing
","
then
you
are
guaranteed
that
you
will
get
at
most
4
items
.
Here
is
an
example
of
this
:
Even
though
i
only
has
two
items
","
the
slice
to
4
works
and
doesn't
raise
an
error
.
Once
i
has
more
than
4
items
","
it
will
limit
to
the
first
four
:
However
","
our
problem
statement
specifically
said
that
check
if
the
first
four
items
contain
9
.
If
we
just
use
the
slice
trick
","
like
this
:
It
will
return
true
even
if
we
pass
it
an
array
like
[
'
1
'
","
'
9
'
]
since
the
slice
will
always
work
.
To
catch
this
condition
-
we
first
check
if
the
length
of
the
list
is
less
than
4
","
because
if
it
is
-
it
automatically
fails
the
condition
.
Thank
you
for
all
your
answers
","
they
have
been
really
helpful
!
I
decided
to
use
the
IF
loop
instead
of
the
FOR
loop
","
like
this
:
As
much
as
I
can
see
","
this
solution
works
no
matter
what
the
length
of
the
list
is
","
and
it
seems
like
it
fits
the
definition
of
the
problem
i.e.
""""
no
matter
what
the
length
of
the

Your

","

the

an

You

first
check

return
False

From
the
discussions
get
to
know
that
you
are
treating
with
list
of
tuple

dict

So
list.pop
always
expect
a
integer
that's
why
you
getting
an
error

And
dict
expect
it's
key
.
So
here
you
have
to
convert
the
input
like
dict
or
pop
up
from
list
with
using
it's
index

You
can
do
it

then
:
I
have
the
following
problem
:
I
have
a
defaultdict
called
word_count
containing

the
number
how
often
they
occur

I
get
this

However
","
this

gives
me
back
things
like
'
\
303\266
'
for
the
German
letter
'
รถ
'
.
Now
I
want
to
go
through
this
dict
","
test
if
one
of
these
things
shown
above
is
there
and
replace
it
with
the
right
thing
like
this
:
Filling
the
defaultdict
:
So
far
it
works
fine
","
I
can
print
the
dict
and
it
gets
me
the
words
with
the
number
.
Now
replacing
the
key
:
Now
this
does
not
work
","
I
guess
because
I
cannot
pop(key)
as
it
expects
an
integer
.
How
else
would
I
do
this
?
I
tried
several
approaches
","
but
nothing
seems
to
work
here

Any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated

Solution
:
Turns
out
this
was
my
fault

I
sorted
the
dict

thereby
turned
it

Setup

have
a

all
the

A
","
B
","
D
","
K

Please
note
some
of
the
columns
have
NaN
as
well
.
How
can
I
calculate
the
entropy
for
each
row
?
i.e.
I
should
find
something
like
following
The
condition
is
that
whenever
the
value
inside
the
log
becomes
zero

NaN
","
the
whole
value
should
be
treated
as
zero

definition

the

will
return
an
error

the

both

A
quick
fix
would
be
to
add
an
extra
dimension

that

3-Dimensional

assuming
here
that

the
image

your
example
"[width, height, image_idx]"

"[height, width, image_idx]"

If
it

way
around

the

indexed
in
the
first
axis

as
it

you
should
replace
Y
[

None
]
with
Y
[
None
","
...
]
.
The
line
Y
[
...
","
None

will
add
an
extra
axis
to
Y
","
making
it
3-dimensional
"[kernel_width, kernel_height, 1]"
and
thus
","
converting
it
to
a
valid
3-Dimensional
convolution
kernel
.
NOTE
:
This
assumes
that
all
your

Some
basic
question
from
beginner
.
Is
there
a
way
to
""""
push
""""
attribute
to
a
decorated
function
not
using
function
arguments
?
Thanks
in
advance
.
If
you
set
the
attribute
on
new_func
instead
","
you
can
access
it
simply
as
decorated_function.some_attr
:
Otherwise
","
wraps
makes
the
original
function
available
as
decorated_function.__wrapped__
in
Python
3
:
In
Python
2
","
the
__wrapped__
is
not
set
by
wraps
","
so
we
need
to
set
it
up
manually
:
However
","
this
sounds
like
an
XY
problem
;
if
you
want
to
pass
a
value
to
the
decorated_function
you
should
let
decorator_
pass
it
as
an
argument
instead
.
Depending
on
whether
you
use
Python
2
or
3
you
can
inject
variables

the
code
.
But
somehow
the
getdata()
from
memory
object
returns
empty
.
Any
help
is
highly
appreciated
.
It's
because
you
stopped
the
asr
with
asr.pause(True)
.
You
only
need
to
write
this
asr.pause(False)
just
before
your
time.sleep
.
You
can
also
use
standard
boxes
in
choregraphe
.
We
can
use
break
statement
inside
if
statement
for
termination
.
Instead
of
break
we
can
write
os.exit
or
sys.exit
os._exit
calls
the
C
function
_exit()
which
does
an
immediate
program
termination
.
Note
the
statement
""""
can
never
return
""""
.
sys.exit()
is
identical
to
raise
SystemExit()
.
It
raises
a
Python
exception
which
may
be
caught
by
the
caller
.
You
can
put
your
code
in
function
.
A
function
you
can
return
the
different
values
.
While
Calling
the
function
you
can
check
what
function
is
returning
.
You
can
use
if
condition
like
Use
break
to
exit
the
loop
.
Use
exit
to
exit
the
program
.
I'm
very
new

know
how

prints

the

I'm

it
still
prints

","
the

does
not
stop
with

continue

Ignore

Here
is
a

I
would
advise
putting

then
manipulating
their

http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6Rjo.png
here
is
my
code
but
it
doesnt
work
as
needed
:
Initially
I
was
not
using
the
unittest
framework
","
so
to
test
that
two
objects
of
the
same
class
are
not
comparable
using
the
operators
<
and
>
=
I
did
something
like
:
after
that
","
though
","
I
decided
to
start
using
the
unittest
module
","
so
I'm
converting
my
tests
to
the
way
tests
are
written
with
the
same
module
.
I
was
trying
to
accomplish
the
equivalent
thing
as
above
with
:
but
this
does
not
quite
work
","
because
o1
<
o2
tries
to
call
the
operator
<
","
instead
of
being
a
reference
to
a
function
","
which
should
be
called
as
part
of
the
test
.
Is
there
a
way
to
accomplish
what
I
need
without
needing
to
wrap
o1
<
o2
in
a
function
?
Use
assertRaises
as
a
context
manager
:
Here
is
an
explanation
of
the
with
statement
.
Here
are
the
docs
.
TL;DR
:
It
allows
the
execution
of
a
code
block
with
a
""""
context
""""
","
i.e.
things
to
be
set
up
and
disposed
before
/
after
the
execution
","
error
handling
etc.
In
the
case
of
assertRaises
","
its
context
manager
simply
checks
whether
an
execption
of
the
required
type
has
been
raised
","
by
checking
the
exc
agrument
passed
to
its
__exit__
method
.
I
like
your
way
","
it
is
explicit
","
the
for
loop
is
understandable
by
all
and
it
isn't
all
that
slow
compared
to
other
approaches
.
Some
suggestions
I'd
make
would
be
to
change
your
condition
from
if
c
!
=
b
'
'
to
if
c
since
a
non-empty
byte
object
will
be
truthy
and
","
*
don't
name
your
list
bytes
","
you
mask
the
built-in
!
Name
it
bt
or
something
similar
:
-
)
Other
options
include
itertools.takewhile
which
will
grab
elements
from
an
iterable
as
long
as
a
predicate
holds
;
your
operation
would
look
like
:
This
is
slightly
slower
but
is
more
compact
","
if
you're
a
one-liner
lover
this
might
appeal
to
you
.
Slightly
faster
and
also
compact
is
using
index
along
with
a
slice
:
While
compact
it
also
suffers
from
readability
.
In
short
","
I'd
go
with
the
for
loop
since
readability
counts
as
very
pythonic
in
my
eyes
.
I
have
a
numpy
bytes
array
containing
characters
","
followed
by
b
'
'
","
followed
by
others
characters
(
including
weird
characters
which
raise
Unicode
errors
when
decoding
)
:
I
want
to
get
everything
before
the
first
b
'
'
.
Currently
my
code
is
:
I
suppose
there
is
a
more
efficient
and
Pythonic
way
to
do
that
.
Any
idea
?
You
are
using
a
ProcessPoolExecutor
.
This
will
fork
new
processes
for
performing
work
.
These
processes
will
not
share
memory
","
each
instead
getting
a
copy
of
the
distances
matrix
.
Thus
any
changes
to
their
copy
will
certainly
not
be
reflected
in
the
original
process
.
Try
using
a
ThreadPoolExecutor
instead
.
NOTE
:
Globals
are
generally
viewed
with
distaste
...
pass
the
array
into
the
function
instead
.
I
have
a
numpy
array(matrix)
","
which
I
want
to
fill
with
calculated
values
in
asynchronously
.
As
a
result
","
I
want
to
have
matrix
distances
with
calculated
values
","
but
at
the
end
I
receive
matrix
filled
with
default(-1)
value
.
I
understand
","
that
something
wrong
with
sharing
distances
between
threads
","
but
I
can't
figure
out
what's
exactly
wrong
.
IIUC
and
you
are
talking
about
pandas
-
you
can
use
squeeze
parameter
:
as
a
vanilla
Python
list
:
from
docs
:
squeeze
:
boolean
","
default
False
If
the
parsed
data
only
contains
one
column
then
return
a
Series
Try
"pandas.Series(data=None, index=None, dtype=None, name=None, copy=False, fastpath=False)"
after
reading
your
data
as
data
frame
with
read_csv
.
Pandas
documentation
Another
possibility
is
to
use
iloc
function
","
when
you
deal
with
a
row
","
not
a
column
.
See
here
:

pandas
data
frame

have
a
data
in
a
column
in
a
csv
format
and
want
to
append
it
in
series
in
python
that
it
can
be
displayed
like
:
How
can
it
be
done
?
Should
I
do
it
via
read_csv
and
then
somehow
transform
it
to
series
or
it
is
a
another
way
?
Thanks
!
The
way
in
Python
to
do
it
would
be
:
or
","
in
Python
3.6
:
However
","
this
is
wrong
!
It
will
fail
if
k
and
v
have
spaces

and
it
can
be
a
security
hazard
(
imagine
if
k
=
'

rm

The
right
way

","
insert
the
value

""""
K
""""

""""
v
""""
in
cmd
after
robocopy
command
","
so
that
with
in
the
for
loop
it
will
perform
robocopy
for
all
the
source
and
destination
mentioned
in
dictionary
D
=
{
}
i
would
also
like
that
the
script
checks
for
failures
in
the
robocopy
output
logs
in

if
two

the

some
email
address

I
guess
...
its
not
really
clear
what

do
the

I
never
bothered
at
the
time
but
have
used
Selenium
in
a
different
project

had
a
user
request

provide
an
answer

here's
the
basics
for
getting
going
with
selenium
to
get
past
the
Forbes
splash
page
.
You'll
need
to
install
a
driver
for
selenium
","
either
firefox
driver
","
chrome
driver
or
PhantomJS
which
is
headless
.
If
you're
on
Mac
","
chromedriver
can
be
easily
installed
via
Homebrew
","
or
by
copying
the
single
PhantomJS
driver
file
to
the
path
indicated
in
the
#
comment
Is
it
possible
for
Requests

navigate
its
way

the
Forbes
welcome
page
?
I'm
trying
to
access
this
article

for
most
will
end
up
with
a
splash
screen
welcome
page
before
then
redirecting
to
the
actual
article
itself
.
I
note
in
Chrome
the
URL
of
the
article
is
then
appended
with
a
value
once
it
resolves
to
the
actual
article
","
though
this
seems
random
every
time

I
have
a
sense
this
may
involve
cookies
but
so
far
my
code
has
not
grabbed
any
html
apart
from
the
html
making
up
the
welcome
page

Output
I
imagine
that
as
a
browser
can
eventually
resolve
to
the
article

Requests
should
be
able
to
as
well
","
but
as
I
can't
work
out
what
Forbes
is
doing

I
can't
work
out
how
to
design
the
Requests
argument
appropriately

Any
ideas

You
can
use
None
:
The
awkwardness
arises
from
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the
:
-
n
syntax
.
Since
there's
no
difference
between
:
0
and
:
-
0
","
we
can't
use
this
syntax
to
distinguish
0
from
the
start
from
0
from
the
end
.
In
this
case
it
is
clearer
to
use
the
:
i
indexing
","
and
adjust
the
range
accordingly
:
arr
[
:
None
]
means
0
from
the
end
","
and
usually
is
sufficient
.
Keep
in
mind
the
arr
[
:
i
]
translates
to
"arr.__getitem__(slice(None,i,None)"
)
.
The
:
syntax
is
short
hand
for
a
slice
object
.
And
the
slice
signature
is
:
slice
itself
is
pretty
simple
.
It's
the
__getitem__
method
that
gives
it
meaning
.
You
could
","
in
theory
","
subclass
list
","
and
give
it
a
custom
__getitem__
that
treats
"slice(None,0,None)"
as
"slice(None,None,None)"
.
I
wish
to
write
a
for
loop
that
prints
the
tail
of
an
array
","
including
the
whole
array
(
denoted
by
i==0
)
Is
this
task
possible
without
a
branching
logic
","
ie
a
if
i==0
statement
inside
the
loop
?
This
would
be
possible
if
there
is
a
syntax
for
slicing
with
inclusive
end
index
.
output
:
wanted
output
:
Had
a
brain
freeze
","

this
would
do

What
you
need
is
to
use

and
otherwise
.
By
the
way
you
don't
have
to
create
that
UDF
.
If
you
really
need
to
call
that
function

you
can
simply
replace
"col(""id"")"
+
1
by
"yourUDF(col(""id"")"

if-else
should
come
inside
the

The

should
come
outside

I'm
currently
trying
to
teach
myself
Python
with
the
Python
Crash
Course
book
by
Eric
Matthes
and
I
seem
to
be
having
difficulties
with
excercise
5-9
regarding
using
if
tests
to
test
empty
lists
.
Here
is
the
question
:
5-9
.
No
Users
:
Add
an
if
test
to
hello_admin.py
to
make
sure
the
list
of
users
is
not
empty
.
•
If
the
list
is
empty
","
print
the
message
We
need
to
find
some
users
!
•
Remove
all
of
the
usernames
from
your
list
","
and
make
sure
the
correct
message
is
printed
.
Here
is
my
code
from
hello_admin.py
:
Now
here
is
my
code
for
5-9
which
is
not
outputting
anything
:
Does
anyone
having
any
feedback
for
why
my
code
is
not
outputting
:
""""
We
need
to
find
some
users
!
""""
Thank
you
for
your
time
.
:
)
It's
not
outputting
anything
since
your
if
and
else
blocks
are
inside
the
for
loop
which
iterates
over
usernames
.
Since
usernames
is
an
empty
list
","
it's
not
iterating
over
anything
","
hence
not
reaching
any
of
those
conditional
blocks
.
You
might
want
to
put
instead
:
That
will
print
the
last
username
in
the
usernames
list
twice
","
though
.
Nothing
","
leave
it
as
is
.
That
is
what
I
could
tell
from
their
documentation
:
https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/class_basics.html?highlight=self
If
I'm
using
mypy

my

","
what

my

be
given
?
I
have
a
raw
list
sorteddict
in
the
form
of
:
and
I
want
to
generate
more
legible
data
by
making
it
a
JSON
object
that
looks
like
:
Unfortunately
so
far
","
I
have
only
found
a
manual
way
to
create
data
as
shown
above
","
and
was
wondering
if
there
was
a
much
more
eloquent
way
of
generating
the
data
rather
than
my
messy
script
.
I
got
to
the
point
where
I
needed
to
retrieve
the
last
item
in
the
list
and
ensure
that
there
was
no
comma
on
the
last
line
before
I
thought
I
should
seek
some
advice
.
Here's
what
I
had
:
I
have
used
json.JSONEncode.encode()
which
I
thought
that
was
what
I
was
looking
for
","
but
what
ended
up
happening
is
""""
Frequencies
""""
would
be
prepended
to
each
s
[0]
item
.
Any
ideas
to
clean
the
code
?
I
may
not
be
understanding
you
correctly
-
but
do
you
just
want
to
turn
a
list
of
"[word, frequency]"
lists
into
a
dictionary
?
If
you
then
want
to
write
this
to
a
file
:
You
need
to
make
a
nested
dict
out
of
your
current
one
","
and
use
json.dumps
.
Not
sure
how
sorteddict
works
","
but
:
should
work
.
Additionally
","
you
say
that
you
want
something
json
encoded
","
but
your
example
is
not
valid
json
.
So
I
will
assume
that
you
actually
want
legitimate
json
.
Here's
some
example
code
:
pandas.DataFrame.drop
takes
level
as
an
optional
argument
"df.drop('1995-96', level='start')"
As
of
v0.18.1
","
its
docstring
says
:
I
have
a
multi-index
dataframe
that
looks
like
this
:
I'd
like
to
drop
by
the
specific
values
for
the
first
level
(
level=0
)
.
In
this
case
","
I'd
like
to
drop
everything
that
has
1995-96
in
the
first
index
.
I'm
+
-
in
the
same
case
as
you
.
I
will
explain
my
solution
.
I'm
not
opening
the
pdfs
with
"PdfFileReader('filename.pdf', 'rb')"
but
I'm
passing
the
pdfs
content
in
an
array
for
the
merge
(
pdfs_content_array
)
.
Then
I'm
preparing
the
merger
and
my
output
(
don't
want
to
save
the
generated
file
locally
so
I
have
to
use
BytesIO
to
save
the
merged
content
somewhere
)
calc_page_sum
is
needed
to
compare
the
page
number
results
.
The
most
important
part
is
:
calc_page_sum
+
=
PdfFileReader(bytes_content)
.
getNumPages()
so
I
open
the
bytes
content
with
PdfFileReader
and
get
the
pages
number
.
Then
I'm
appending
the
merger
...
merger.append
","
bytes_content
I'm
writing
the
merge
into
my
bytes
output
and
compare
it
with
the
calc_page_sum
.
That's
it
.
Hope
this
will
help
!
2nd
Version
:
I
am
trying
to
use
PdfFileMerger()
in
PyPDF2
to
merge
pdf
files
(
see
code
)
.
However
","
my
merge
commands
are
subject
to
certain
conditions
and
it
could
turn
out
that
no
merged
pdf
file
is
generated
.
I
would
like
to
know
how
to
determine
the
page
count
after
performing
merges
using
PdfFileMerger()
.
If
nothing
else
","
I
would
like
to
know
if
the
number
of
pages
is
non-zero
.
Maintaining
a
counter
to
do
this
would
be
cumbersome
because
I
am
performing
the
merges
across
several
functions
and
would
prefer
a
more
elegant
solution
.
The
doctest
documentation
has
a
section
about
execution
context
.
My
reading
is
that
the
globals
in
the
module
are
shallow
copied
for
the
tests
in
each
docstring
","
but
are
not
reset
between
tests
within
a
docstring
.
Based
on
that
description
","
I
would
have
thought
the
following
doctests
would
pass
:
But
instead
the
following
tests
pass
!
It
seems
like
the
globals
are
shared
across
tests
across
docstrings
?
But
only
within
function
calls
?
Why
is
this
the
resulting
behavior
?
Does
this
have
something
to
do
with
functions
having
a
dictionary
of
globals
separate
from
the
execution
context
?
Not
exactly
.
While
it
is
true
that
the
globals
are
shallow
copied
","
what
you
are
actually
seeing
is
the
scoping
of
globals
(
using
the
keyword
global
)
and
how
it
actually
operates
at
the
module
level
in
Python
.
You
can
observe
this
by
putting
in
a
pdb.set_trace()
inside
function
f
right
after
the
assignment
(
X
=
2
)
.
Yes
","
the
value
is
indeed
2
within
the
scope
of
f
","
but
let's
take
a
look
of
its
globals
.
Let's
look
at
how
they
compare
in
the
current
frame
and
up
a
frame
.
Ah
ha
","
you
can
see
that
they
are
NOT
actually
the
same
thing
","
and
that
X
is
indeed
1
and
has
not
been
changed
","
because
the
globals
there
are
within
the
<
doctest
doc.f
>
module
created
by
doctest
for
this
reason
.
Let's
continue
.
So
what
you
actually
saw
is
that
the
globals
within
the
doctest
is
not
the
same
one
as
the
one
on
your
source
(
hence
g
will
return
2
because
X
was
really
was
changed
in
the
module
here
by
f
","
but
not
in
the
doctest
module
shallow
copy
scope
)
","
even
though
it
originally
was
copied
from
the
module
but
the
changes
are
not
reflected
back
to
the
underlying
module
since
this
is
how
the
global
keyword
operates
-
at
the
module
level
","
not
across
modules
.

I
can't
target
my

I'm

I
can't
download
everything

from
what
I

still

appcfg

anyone

You
can
import and
use

just
immediately

you

think
to
use

you
may
need

The

If

:
Iterating
over
the
groups
of
partial
entries
looks
like
a
job
for
itertools.groupby
.
But
first
lets
put
relationships
into
a
format
that
is
easier
to
use
","
prehaps
a
back_populates:label
dictionary
?
Next
because
we
will
be
using
itertools.groupby
it
will
need
a
keyfunc
to
distinguish
between
the
different
groups
of
entries
.
So
given
one
entry
from
the
initial
results
","
this
function
will
return
a
dictionary
with
only
the
pairs
that
will
not
be
condensed
/
converted
Now
we
will
be
able
to
traverse
the
results
in
groups
something
like
this
:
The
only
issue
is
that
if
we
build
our
entry
from
base_info
it
will
confuse
groupby
so
we
need
to
make
an
entry
to
work
with
:
Note
that
I
am
using
sets
here
because
they
are
the
natural
container
when
all
contence
are
unique
","
however
because
it
is
not
json-compatible
we
will
need
to
change
them
into
lists
at
the
end
.
Now
that
we
have
an
entry
to
build
we
can
just
iterate
through
the
group
to
add
to
each
new
field
from
the
original
then
once
the
final
entry
is
constructed
all
that
is
left
is
to
convert
the
sets
back
into
lists
And
that
entry
is
done
","
now
we
can
either
append
it
to
a
list
called
new_results
but
since
this
process
is
essentially
generating
results
it
would
make
more
sense
to
put
it
into
a
generator
making
the
final
code
look
something
like
this
:
Then
the
new_results
can
be
gotten
like
this
:
I
have
a
database
schema
in
Postgres
that
looks
like
this
(
in
pseudo
code
)
:
Hopefully
this
makes
intuitive
sense
.
It's
a
users
table
that
has
a
many-to-many
relationship
with
a
permissions
table
as
well
as
a
many-to-many
relationship
with
an
addresses
table
.
In
Python
","
when
I
perform
the
correct
SQLAlchemy
query
incantations
","
I
get
back
results
that
look
something
like
this
(
after
converting
them
to
a
list
of
dictionaries
in
Python
)
:
So
in
this
contrived
example
","
Joe
is
both
a
user

an
admin
.
John

only
a
user

Both
Joe's
home
and
work
addresses
exist

Only
John's
home

So
the

anybody
know
the
best
way

consideration

I've
put
together
a
concrete
example

the
purposes

this
question

in

querying
SQL
databases

general
","
assuming
an
arbitrary
amount

relationships

SQLAlchemy
ORM

this
problem
well

I'm
limited
to
using
SQLAlchemy
Core

so
am

Update
Here's
an
answer
","
but
I'm
not
sure
it's
the
best

most
efficient
solution
.
Can
anyone
come
up
with
something
better
?
If
you
check
the
implementation
of
get_context_name()
","
you'll
see
this
:
And
the
implementation
for
get_context_data()
(
from
SingleObjectMixin
)
:
So
you
can
see
that
get_context_data()
adds
to
the
dictionary
an
entry
with
the
key
context_object_name
(
from
get_context_object_name()
)
which
returns
obj._meta.model_name
when
self.context_object_name
isn't
defined
.
In
this
case
","
the
view
got
self.object
as
a
consequence
of
the
call
to
get()
which
calls
get_object()
.
get_object()
takes
the
model
that
you've
defined
and
automatically
queries
it
from
your
database
using
the
pk
you've
defined

your

However
","
since

You
could
also
do
TState

means
""""

compute
the

its

you
can
reverse
the

For
comparison
","
here
is
a
similar
calculation
in
R
:
I
am
new
to
chi
squared
testing

trying
to
figure
out
what
the
'
standard
'
way
of
running
a
chi-squared
test
and
also
getting
a
95
%
confidence
interval
on
the
difference
between
success
rates

two
experiments

My
data
looks
like
this
:
These
numbers
represent
the
counts

what
was
observed

an

the

What
I'd

:
A
test
statistic

whether
Condition
A's
success
rate

33
%

statistically
different
from
Condition
B's
success

get
a
95

confidence
interval

You
do
need
to
import the
modules
somehow
but
the
“
recommended
”
way
is
a
bit
tricky
since
things
kept
changing
with
new
versions
of
Python
","
see
this
answer
.
Here's
an
example
based
on
the
test
runner
of
the
gorilla
library
that
is
compatible
with
Python
2
and
Python
3
:
Here
/
path

to
/
your
/
package
would
be
the
repository
to
the
package
","
that
is
the
directory
containing
the
readme
","
the
docs
","
and
so
on
like
it
is
commonly
the
case
with
Python's
packages
","
and
package_name
would
be
the
directory
name
inside
the
repository
that
contains
the
root
__init__.py
file
.
In
fact
the
function
module_iterator
also
accepts
a
module
for
its
parameter
package_dotted_path
","
such
as
'
package.subpackage.module
'
for
example
","
but
then
only
the
functions
from
this
specific
module
would
be
retrieved
.
If
a
package
is
passed
instead
","
then
all
the
recursively
nested
modules
will
be
inspected
.
I
am
trying
to
list
all
the
functions
in
every
encountered
module
to
enforce
the
writing
of
test
cases
.
However
","
I
am
having
issues
doing
this
with
just
the
fullpath
to
the
file
as
a
string
and
not
importing
it
.
When
I
use
"inspect.getmembers(fullpath, inspect.isfunction)"
it
returns
an
empty
array
.
Is
there
any
way
to
accomplish
this
?
Here
is
my
code
so
far
:
I
am
trying
to
format
the
results
of
a
query
such
that
results
are
printed
on
their
respective
lines
.
For
example
","
I
am
querying
stores
by
store
number
and
obtaining
the
location
from
a
JSON
file
","
but
when
printing
","
the
store
number
and
location
are
printing
on
separate
lines
:
Code
Snippet
:
(
Searching
for
stores
35
and
96
)
Current
Output
:
Store
:
35
{
'
location
'
:
Iowa
}
Store
:
96
{
'
location
'
:
Minnesota
}
Desired
output
(
or
something
similar
)
:
Store
:
35
","
'
location
'
:
Iowa
Store
:
96
","
'
location
'
:
Minnesota
I
would
write
all
the
output
in
a
variable
and
print
the
variable
only
once
at
the
end
.
This
also
allows
you
to
save
time
(
despite
using
more
memory
)
since
you
need
only
a
single
access
to
the
stdout
.
The
code
is
also
easier
to
follow
(
in
my
opinion
)
:
You
can
also
print
at
the
end
of
each
iteration
(
you
still
access
half
of
the
times
to
the
stdout
)
with
the
following
:
If
you
want
a
new
line
for
each
Store
but
not
for
each
""""
location
""""
:
I
think
this
approach
is
much
more
flexible
","
easier
to
read
in
the
code
and
is
also
faster
.
Hope
to
be
helpful
Adding
end
=
'
'
to
your
first
print
statement
should
fix
the
problem
.
By
specifying
that
the
end
character
is
an
empty
string
you
will
override
the
default
\
n
character
(
by
default
print
statements
end
with
a
new
line
character
)
.
We
will
only
add
end
=
'
'
to
the
first
print
statement
because
we
want
the
new
line
to
print
after
you
print
out
the
location
.
If
you
want
to
separate
your
prints
with
a
","
of
course
you
would
just
add
+
'
","
'
to
your
first
print
statement
.
This
will
work
right
off
the
bat
if
you're
using
Python
3
.
If
you're
using
Python
2.X
you
will
have
to
add
this
line
to
the
top
of
your
file
:
from
__future__
import print_function
Here's
a
simple
example
of
this
in
action
:
If
we
took
the
same
code
but
altered
it
slightly
and
just
removed
the
end
=
'
'
","
this
is
what
would
happen
:
As
you
can
see
each
line
would
end
with
a
new
line
character
","
this
printing
a
new
line
for
each
statement
.
Okay
so
two
ways
I
did
quickly
!
The
second
loop
is
definitely
the
way
to
go
.
It
uses
re.sub
(
as
someone
else
commented
too
)
.
It
replaces
with
the
lowercase
search
term
bear
in
mind
.
Maybe
I'm
misinterpretting
your
question
","
but
wouldn't
re.sub
be
the
best
option
?
Example
:
https://repl.it/DExs
I
wrote
a
script
in
Python
for
custom
HTML
page
that
finds
a
word
within
a
string
/
line
and
highlights
just
that
word
with
use
of
following
tags
where
instance
is
the
word
that
is
searched
for
.
With
the
following
result
:
I
need
to
find
a
word
(
case
insensitive
)
let's
say
""""
port

within
a
string
that
can
be
port
","
Port
","
SUPPORT
","
Support
","
support
etc
","
which
is
easy
enough
.
However
my
strings
often
contain
2
or
more
instances
in
single
line
","
and
I
need
to
append
<
b><font
"color=\""red\"">""+instance"
+
""""
<
/
font
>
<
/
b
>
to
each
of
those
instances
","
without
changing
cases
.
Problem
with
my
approach
","
is
that
I
am
attempting
to
itterate
over
each
of
instances
found
with
findall
(
exact
match
)
","
while
multiple
same
matches
can
also
be
found
within
the
string
.
This
results
in
following
:
when
I
need
I
was
thinking
","
I
would
be
able
to
avoid
this
if
I
was
able
to
find
out
exact
part
of
the
string
that
the
pattern.sub
substitutes
at
the
moment
of
doing
it
","
however
I
was
not
able
to
find
any
examples
of
that
kind
of
usage
","
which
leads
me
to
believe
that
I
am
doing
something
very
wrong

If
anyone
have
a
way
I
could
use
to
insert
<
b><font
"color=""red"">instance"
<
/
font
>
<
/
b
>
without
replacing
instance
for
all
matches(case insensitive)
","
then
I
would
be
grateful

You

then
use
boolean

what
I've
tried

This

the

:
Why
are
the
operations
using
the
numpy
arrays
so
much
slower
than
the
normal
python
array
?
As
general
rule
","
iterative
operations
on
numpy
arrays
is
slower
than
equivalent
ones
on
lists
.
In
part
that's
because
creating
an
array
from
a
list
takes
time
","
whether
it's
the
initial
creation
or
some
intermediate
step
.
Numpy
arrays
gain
their
speed
advantage
when
you
perform
compiled
operations
on
them
-
ones
where
the
iteration
takes
place
at
compiled
speeds
rather
than
interpreted
ones
.
In
your
example
","
the
dictionary
source
isn't
important
Take
the
simple
task
of
adding
1
to
all
values
:
Your
string
formatting
case
:
or
with
list
comprehensions
instead
of
map
:
Performing
this
same
action
on
narr.tolist()
is
nearly
as
good
","
and
better
than
iterating
on
narr
directly
.
[
c
for
c
on
narr
]
produces
a
list
of
4
arrays
;
[
str(i)
for
i
in
c

then
requires
iterating
on
each
of
those
subarrays
.
Making
a
list
of
Point
objects
from
a
numpy
array
is
a
poor
use
of
the
structure
.
You
could
make
a
structured
array
","
and
access
'
x
'
values
for
a
whole
set
of
points
.
That's
the
key
-
use
arrays
when
you
want
to
work
with
the
whole
structure
","
or
at
least
whole
rows
and
columns
.
I
have
a
SQLAlchemy
db.Model
like
this
:
Now
I
have
a
query
like
:
I
want
to
execute
the
update
method
on
all
elements
of
this
query
.
The
following
is
very
inefficient
because
every
call
to
update
takes
2
/
3
seconds
.
How
can
I
run
update
on
all
elements
in
my
query
in
parallel
?
I
ended
up
changing
the
way
I
did
things
","
and
put
a
REST
API
around
the
Action
model
.
Updates
are
done
by
sending
PUT
to
a
/
api
/
action
/
{
id
}
endpoint
.
My
API
client
can
be
asynchronous
so
that
the
requests
are
executed
in
parallel
.
Now
the
REST
API
itself
is
multiprocessed
and
spread
over
multiple
instances
and
SQLAlchemy
ensures
connections
to
the
database
are
concurrent
.
Client
usage
looks
like
this

I
have
been
trying
to
use
the
following
code
to
move
files

are

a
csv
list
.
But
at
most
it
will
copy
the
last
file
in
the
list
but
not
the
rest
.
I
keep
hitting
this
wall
with
every
example
I
have
seen
listed
what
am
I
doing
wrong
?
My
CVS
list
will
have
a
list
like
:
Here's
my
code
The
reason
why
it's
only
the
last
file
that
could
be
copied
(
if
it
was
)
is
because
in
this
line
:
you
are
referencing
rowDict
outside
of
the
first
for-loop
.
So
at
that
execution
moment
","
it
contains
the
last
value
of
this
loop
.
If
I
understand
correctly
what
you
are
trying
to
do
you
could
try
something
like
this
(
untested
code
)
:
So
instead
of
:
Constructing
a
dictionary
with
all
the
values
in
your
CSV
file
Somehow
check
for
every
file
in
your
source
directory
that
it
is
included
in
your
dictionary
(
which
is
what
I
interpreted
you
were
trying
to
do
)
And
move
it
if
it
does
.
You
could
:
For
every
file
extracted
from
your
CSV
","
check
that
it
exists
in
your
source
directory
.
If
it
does
","
you
move
it
to
the
destination
directory
.
Is
that
what
you
were
trying
to
doÂ
?
[
And
if
the
filename
stays
the
same
","
you
only
need
to
specify
the
destination
directory
for
the
second
argument
of
shutil.move()
]
I
think
doing
something
like
this
will
work
(
untested
)
:
As
an
optimization
","
unless
you
need
the
keys
dictionary
for
other
processing
","
you
could
change
the
first
part
so
it
just
creates
the
valid_files
set
variable
used
in
the
second
for
loop
:
This
old
answer
tells
to
apply
mode=ctypes.RTLD_GLOBAL
","
i.e.
in
this
case
I
want
to
use
some
functions

a
shared
library

From
the

I
know
ctypes
is
a
good
choice
.
However
such
library
have
some
undefined

I
should
link
it

another
shared

get

In
g

it

The

need

and
liba.so
has
some
undefined

can
be
solved

But
how
to
do
that
in
ctypes

ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary('liba.so')

how
to

Because
ldd
liba.so
not
show
a

What
you
can
do
is
add
a
third
parameter
that
will
keep
track
of
the
original
size
","
and
have
your
arguments
in
your
overlay_frac()
function
be
based
off
of
that
variable
","
so
that
the
values
don't
alter
in
recursion
.
Here's
how
I've
done
it
:
Implement
the
function
tree
that
takes
a
number
of
slices
n
and
a
rune
as
arguments
","
and
generates
a
stack
of
runes
(
shape
)
scaled
and
overlayed
on
top
of
each
other
.
the
shape
at
the
top
must
be
1
/
n
the
size
of
the
original
shape
.
the
shape
at
the
second
level
must
be
2
/
n
the
size
of
the
original
shape
and
so
on
.
i.e.
the
shape
at
the
bottom
is
the
original
shape
.
So
I
tried
to
do
this
in
a
recursive
manner
using
some
ideas
from
mathematical
induction
.
My
question
is
how
would
you
fix
the
initial
value
of
n
because
this
recursion
keeps
altering
the
value
?
I
can't
set
a
=
n
outside
of
the
recursion
as
n
is
defined
in
the
function
.
Is
there
a
way
for
me
to
set
the
initial
value
of
n
to
another
letter
so
it
wouldn't
change
?
Right
now
I'm
not
even
sure
if
this
code
works
.
But
without
being
able
to
fix
it
","
I
can't
test
it
.
FYI
:
I
am
aware
that
you
guys
might
not
know
what
overlay_frac
and
scale
does
but
the
codes
for
those
are
given
to
me
.
My
question
really
revolves
around
a
way
to
set
the
initial
input
of
a
recursion
so
that
it
will
not
be
affected
as
the
process
loops
.
Adding
another
parameter
is
certainly
a
feasible
option
.
In
the
event
that
you
under
certain
constraints
and
unable
to
change
the
formal
parameters
defined
for
the
outer
function
","
you
may
consider
using
a
helper
function
as
well
.
Both
of
them
are
calling
python.exe
.
As
for
the
python.exe
there
is
no
difference
to
run
.
During
python
installation
","
if
you
selected
'
add
python
to
PATH
'
to
add
path
of
python.exe
into
environment
variables
","
then
","
you
can
run
python.exe
directly
in
PS
.
If
you
didn't
check
it
","
you
may
need
to
locate
the
folder
contains
python.exe
to
run
.
py
file
.
In
addition
","
python.exe
can
be
run
under
other
user
privilege
using
'
start-process
'
with
parameter
'
-
credential
'
.
If
you
run

it
will

I
am
learning

and
trying
to
start

I
came
to
know
I
can
start
the
python
services
either
by
one
of
these
commands
.
Though
both
of
these
gives
the
same
result
","
I
am
curious
to
know
what
is
the
difference
between
these
two
in
terms
of
internal
functions
and
which
is
better
to
use
?
You
can't
pass
CPython-specific
PyXxx
structures
via
CFFI
:
you
need
to
pass
standard
C
data
.
Normally
I'd
answer
that
you
need
to
design
your
cdef()
'
ed
function
with
a
standard
C
interface
","
for
example
something
like
:
Then
you
need
to
manually
convert
the
myimage
to
a
numpy
array
","
somewhere
in
the
""""
...
""""
code
above
.
One
better
alternative
is
to
use
a
Python
callback
:
a
callback
that
makes
the
numpy
array
according
to
spec
and
returns
a
C-standard
float
*
pointer
.
The
numpy
array
itself
is
saved
somewhere
in
the
callback
.
You
could
save
it
as
a
Python
global
","
or
more
cleanly
use
a
""""
handle
""""
you
pass
via
C
.
Requires
the
API
version
","
not
the
ABI
.
In
_example_build.py
:
In
file
example.py
:
Idea
is
to
be
able
to
modify
array
from
library
","
like
an
""""
output
""""
from
a
function
.
Example
:
The
problem
is
that
you're
expecting
input
to
return
you
a
int
which
it
doesn't
do
on
Python
3
.
Python
3
input
works
the
same
way
as
raw_input
on
Python
2
returning
a
string
that
you
need
to
convert
to
other
type
yourself
.
You
should
be
able
to
fix
your
code
by
doing
the
conversions
at
the
required
places
and
switching
all
raw_input
calls
to
input
since
there's
no
raw_input
on
Python
3
.

In
the
Python
Shell
you
can
only
type
one
line
of
code
at
a
time
.
Here
is
an
example
to
illustrate
my
point
further
:
As
you
can
tell
from
the
above
program
","
indention
is
noted
by
three
dots
:
...
","
and
the
only
time
the
Python
Shell
shows
more
then
one
line
at
a
time
","
is
when
it
is
'
echoing
'
back
what
you
typed
in
.
Why
is
it
called
interactive
?
One
of
the
main
reason
its
called
interactive
is
that
to
display
variable
values
or
run
the
module
in
general
","
you
don't
have
to
explicitly
invoke
the
python
interpreter
.
Take
the
example
below
:
As
displayed
above
","
I
was
able
to
print
the
value
of
name
and
run
the
function
func()
without
having
to
use
a
print
command
or
explicitly
calling
the
python
interpreter
.
The
Python
Shell
is
not
really
a
practical
way
to
write
long
/
complex
programs
","
as
writing
code
__init__(see what i did there)
would
prove
to
be
cumbersome
and
awkward
.
A
better
choice
would
be
to
use
the
Python
IDLE
.
It
is
a
script
editor
for
python
that
comes
builtin
into
the
python
installation
package
.
Disclaimer
:
i
could
be
completely
wrong
about
this
.
I
am
simply
going
off
of
the
python
docs
and
my
own
experience
;
)
.
I
don't
know
about
the
meaning
of
calculator
mode
in
Python
","
and
I've
put
the
portion
of
documentation
below
.
If
you
quit
from
the
Python
interpreter
and
enter
it
again
","
the
definitions
you
have
made
(
functions
and
variables
)
are
lost
.
Therefore
","
if
you
want
to
write
a
somewhat
longer
program
","
you
are
better
off
using
a
text
editor
to
prepare
the
input
for
the
interpreter
and
running
it
with
that
file
as
input
instead
.
This
is
known
as
creating
a
script
.
As
your
program
gets
longer
","
you
may
want
to
split
it
into
several
files
for
easier
maintenance
.
You
may
also
want
to
use
a
handy
function
that
youâ€™ve
written
in
several
programs
without
copying
its
definition
into
each
program
.
To
support
this
","
Python
has
a
way
to
put
definitions
in
a
file
and
use
them
in
a
script
or
in
an
interactive
instance
of
the
interpreter
.
Such
a
file
is
called
a
module
;
definitions
from
a
module
can
be
imported
into
other
modules

into
the
main
module

the
collection
of

Here's
the
original
document
.
I
am
new
to
Django
and
I
am
currently
having
problems
in
showing
uploaded
images
in
Django
Admin
.
I
have
followed
many
posted
Q
and
A
here
in
stackoverflow
but
of
those
worked
in
my
problem
.
I
hope
any
active
of
the
coding
ninja
here
could
help
me
with
this
problem
.
Here
is
the
detailed
view
of
the
problem
:
I
have
defined
the
MEDIA_ROOT
and
MEDIA_URL
in
settings.py
This
is
my
upload
model
in
models.py
:
In
my
Application
urls.py
:
In
my
admin.py
:
The
image
was
successfully
stored
at
ProjectDIR
/
media
.
The
HTML
returns
the
url
:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/imagename.jpg
at
img
tag
.
But
the
page
fails
to
load
the
image
(
I
will
be
redirected
to
index
page
whenever
when
using
the
url
http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/imagename.jpg
)
.
I
am
using
Django
version
1.10
As
suspected
","
this
problem
is
about
URLs
in
Django
.
The
problem
occurred
because
I
declared
the
following
urlpattern
in
an
app
urls.py
:
I
solved
the
problem
by
changing
the
code
to
:
And
adding
the
following
code
at
the
project's
main
urls.py
:
Here's
one
method
that
splits
the
data
into
nested
lists
and
then
constructs
a
dict
.
I'm
largely
guessing
at
the
desired
data
structure
.
Disclaimer
:
there
is
likely
a
more
efficient
way
of
doing
this
with
regex
","
and
this
method
isn't
ideal
if
reading
the
entire
file
into
memory
is
going
to
be
an
issue
.
Output
:
I
am
trying
to
parse
and
then
edit
the
text
that
lives
between
{
and
a
}
.
The
information
is
different(in between the curly braces)
so
I
would
need
to
be
able
to
have
these
results
separated
in
some
type
of
buffer
to
test
the
/
test
and
/
example
for
each
one
.
Information
in
file
Script
I
am
not
sure
where
to
start
calling
the
dictionary
as
I
want
to
somehow
call
everything
between
the
first
server
{
and
}
.
The
final
goal
is
to
be
able
to
run
a
curl
to
test
the
example.com
/
test
redirection
and
test.com
/
example
redirect
get
the
output
from
this
and
diff
that
to
what
is
currently
in
our
configuration
files
.
The
purpose
of
this
is
to
audit
these
prior
to
moving
them
to
avoid
keeping
configurations
that
are
no
longer
needed
.
I
had
trouble
finding
info
on
this
","
if
there
is
a
document
somewhere
I
need
to
RTFM
then
please
feel
free
to
drop
a
link
.
Edit
Things
looking
for
script
to
do
:
Take
nginx
server
block's
and
grab
value(s)
of
""""
server_name
""""
Grab
value
of
rewrite
/
test
/
example
<--
actual
string
is
random
Test
both
of
these
value's
with
curl
-
w
""""
%
{
url_effective}\n
""""
-
I
-
L
-
s
-
S
$m
-
o
/
dev
/
null
Then
diff
the
curl
output
to
whats
rewritten
.
Take
note
that
I
don't
need
to
parse
example.com
/
example
as
the
/
example
redirection
is
in
a
different
server
block
.
Hope
this
makes
more
since
.
There
are
thousands
of
server
blocks
hence
the
reason
for
this
.
My
solution
was
to
set
up
the
module
like
this
:
The
setup.py
would
contain
something
similar
to
this
:
and
the
file
a.py
would
contain
the
following
lines
in
the
header
:
The
way
it
works
is
very
simple
:
if
you
don't
do
anything
(
i.e.
if
you
don't
compile
the
cython
files
)
then
module
a.py
imports
module
b.py
;
however
","
if
you
run
python
setup.py
build_ext
-
-
inplace
then
the
compiled
cython
files
will
appear
inside
cython_my_module
and
the
next
time
you
run
a.py
it
will
automatically
import the
cython
module
b.pyx
(
actually
it
will
import the
compiled
library
b.so
)
.
So
far
it
seems
to
work
and
requires
almost
no
effort
.
Hope
it
helps
.
fish2000
solution
seems
more
generic
but
I
haven't
tried
it
yet
.
I
have
a
pure
Python
module
and
I
want
to
rewrite
some
of
submodules
using
Cython
.
Then
I
would
like
to
add
the
new
Cython
submodules
to
the
original
Python
module
and
make
them
available
only
as
an
option
","
meaning
that
cythoning
the
module
is
not
compulsory
(
in
which
case
the
'
old
'
pure
Python
module
should
be
used
)
.
Here
is
an
example
:
where
a.py
contains
import b
.
I
want
to
write
b.py
in
Cython
.
The
idea
would
be
to
add
a
folder
containing
the
.
pyx
file
","
for
example
:
setup.py
would
contain
the
direction
to
compile
b.pyx
and
to
install
the
module
.
However
","
I
would
like
that
if
someone
runs
python
setup.py
install
then
the
pure
Python
code
is
installed
","
whereas
if
an
option
is
added
then
the
Cython
code
is
compiled
and
installed
.
Any
idea
how
to
do
that
?
Also
","
how
should
the
file
a.py
be
modified
in
order
to
import the
correct
module
?
I
am
not
sure
about
your
setup.py
requirement
(
I
don’t
know
why
you
would
need
that
)
but
as
for
the
runtime
import issue
","
I
wrote
a
decorator
to
do
just
that
:
…
this
lets
you
decorate
functions
as
@external
–
and
they
are
replaced
at
runtime
automatically
with
the
Cython-optimized
versions
you’ve
provided
.
If
you
wanted
to
extend
this
idea
to
replacing
entire
Cythonized
classes
","
it’d
be
straightforward
to
use
the
same
logic
in
the
__new__
method
of
a
metaclass
(
e.g
.
opportunistic
find-and-replace
in
the
optimized
module
)
.
The
entire
block
function
definition
for
letterGradeConversion
needs
to
be
indented

Take
a
look

Python
docs
on
indentation

could
you
please
help
me
to
understand

why

When
assigning

a
pandas
object
","
pandas
treats
the
assignment
more
""""
rigorously
""""
.
A
pandas

pandas
assignment
must
pass
stricter
protocols
.
Only
when
you
turn
it
to
a

or
equivalently
"pd.Series([0, 1])"

did
pandas
give
in

allow
you
to
assign

the
way
you'd
imagine
it
should
work
.
That
higher
standard
of
assignment
requires
that
the
indices
line
up
as
well
","
so
even
if
you
had
the
right

it
still
wouldn't
have

You

the

My
command
line
script
takes
several
arguments
including
strings
","
ints
","
floats
and
lists
","
and
it
is
becoming
a
bit
tricky
to
do
the
call
with
all
arguments
:
To
avoid
having
to
write
all
arguments
in
the
command
line
I
have
created
a
text
file
with
all
arguments
which
I
simply
read
line
by
line
to
collect
arguments
.
This
is
working
fine
","
but
is
this
the
best
practice
for
doing
this
?
Are
there
a
more
effective
way
?
This
program
randomly
generates
weights
for
several
artificial
neural
networks
using
a
loop
","
calculates
the
output
of
the
network
and
appends
that
to
the
end
of
each
array
","
then
appends
the
cost
to
the
end
of
each
array
.
When
run
without
sorting
the
arrays
this
program
does
all
calculations
correctly
","
but
when
I
try
to
sort
the
array
by
the
last
item
in
each
array
it
seems
like
it
breaks
the
loop
even
though
the
sort
function
is
called
after
all
the
other
functions
.
Your
current
approach
sorts
the
list
but
does
not
return
the
result
nor
update
the
network
.
Note
that
sorted
returns
a
sorted
list
.
You
want
an
in-place
sort
:
Are
all
5
of
your
processes
applying
the
same
function
","
but
to
different
inputs
?
If
this
is
the
case
","
then
using
Pool.map()
from
multiprocessing
is
appropriate
:
So
the
function
f(x)
is
being
applied
to
different
inputs
on
each
process
","
and
then
the
output
is
collected
in
a
list
(
equivalent
to
your
'
my_list
'
that
was
empty
to
begin
with
)
.
The
output
array
is
ordered
in
the
same
way
as
the
input
array
i.e.
if
input
=
"[x1,x2,x3,x4,x5]"
then
output
=
[
f(x1)
","
f(x2)
","
f(x3)
","
f(x4)
","
f(x5)
]
.
Let's
say
that
I
have
an
empty
list
my_list
and
5
processes
pr1
","
pr2
","
pr3
","
pr4
","
pr5
","
where
each
of
them
appends
something
to
my
list
.
My
question
is
:
Is
something
like
this
possible
?
And
will
it
behave
normaly
or
an
error
will
occur
?
If
these
processes
are
independent
then
something
like
this
is
not
possible
.
At
least
not
without
some
additional
mechanisms
like
sockets
(
which
greatly
increases
complexity
)
.
If
these
are
created
via
multiprocessing
and
my_list
is
just
a
list
then
each
process
will
have
its
own
copy
of
the
list
.
Again
in
multiprocessing
if
you
define
my_list
as
multiprocessing.Queue
then
indeed
this
will
be
a
shared
structure
between
processes
.
I
am
looking
for
guidance
in
how
to
achieve
start
/
stop
functionality
of
a
function
","
which
makes
a
restAPI
to
retrieve
data
in
JSON
format
continuously
","
by
clicking
a
button
on
a
rendered
html
page
through
webapp2
and
hosted
on
GAE
?
The
current
behaviour
is
once
the
http
request
is
completed
the
function
that
was
called
of
course
stops
(
while
self._running
=
=
True)(normal
behaviour
according
to
the
GAE
documentation
)
.
main.py
:
page.html
:
The
start
/
stop
functionality
is
simple
-
just
make
the
button
control
something
like
an
operation_is_stopped
flag
persisted
across
requests
(
in
the
datastore
","
for
example
)
.
In
case
you
didn't
realize
it
yet
your
difficulty
really
comes
from
achieving
the
continuous
operation
that
you
want
to
control
with
that
button
.
That's
what's
not
really
compatible
with
GAE
-
everything
in
GAE
revolves
around
responding
to
requests
","
in
a
limited
amount
of
time
.
You
can
not
really
have
indefinitely-running
proceses
/
threads
in
GAE
.
But
in
many
cases
it's
possible
to
implement
a
long-running
","
iterative
continuous
operation
(
like
yours
)
as
a
flow
of
short-lived
operations
.
In
GAE
that
can
be
easily
achieved
using
the
task
queues
-
each
iteration
(
in
your
case
the
body
of
the
while
self._running
=
=
True
loop
)
is
implemented
as
a
response
to
a
task
queue
request
.
The
flow
is
started
by
enqueueing
a
respective
task
when
the
""""
start
""""
action
is
triggered
.
The
flow
is
maintained
by
enqueueing
a
respective
task
after
processing
of
a
previous
task
request
.
And
it's
stopped
by
not
enqueueing
a
new
task

Something
along

You
will
need

I
read
this
topic

wxPython

Calling

tried

I
also
tried
:
Which
doesn't
work
as
well
.
The
things
like
wx.EVT_KILL_FOCUS
are
not
the
event
object
needed
here
.
Those
are
instances

wx.PyEventBinder
which
","
as
the
name
suggests
","
are
used
to
bind
events
to
handlers
.
The
event
object
needed
for
the
PostEvent

ProcessEvent
functions
will
be
the
same
type
of

what
is
received

the
event
handler
functions
.
In
this
case
it
would
be
an
instance
of
wx.FocusEvent

When
creating
the
event
object
you
may
also
need
to
set
the
event
type

that
event

is
used
with
more

one
type

The
binder
object
has
that
value
to
help
you
know
what
to
use
.
You
usually
also
need
to
set
the
ID
to
the
ID
of
the
window
where
the
event
originated

So
for
your

it

Perhaps
a
better
rewrite

to

You
just
need
to
rstrip
the

you
don't
compare

dog\n
","
the
newline

the

you

If

need

rstrip

If
you're
using

follow

then
this
shouldn't

as
you
can
specify
the

See
here

Also
there's
an
alternative
approach
that
skips
the
tf.cond
completely
.
Just
define
two
losses
one
that
follows
the
data
through
the
autoencoder
and
discrimator

the
other
that
follows
the

it

becomes
a
matter

calling

In
this
way
the
graph
will
only
run
through
which
ever
loss
was
called
upon
.
Let
me
know
if
this
needs
more
explanation
.
Lastly
I
think
to
make
variant
one
work
you
need
to
do
something
like
this
if
you're
using
preloaded
data
.
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/how_tos/reading_data/index.html#preloaded-data
Otherwise
I'm
not
sure
what
the
issue
is
to
be
honest
.
Situation
I
want
to
train
a
specific
network
architecture
(
a
GAN
)
that
needs
inputs
from
different
sources
during
training
.
One
input
source
is
examples
loaded
from
disk
.
The
other
source
is
a
generator
sub-network
creating
examples
.
To
choose
which
kind
of
input
to
feed
to
the
network
I
use
tf.cond
.
There
is
one
caveat
though
that
has
already
been
explained
:
tf.cond
evaluates
the
inputs
to
both
conditional
branches
even
though
only
one
of
those
will
ultimately
be
used
.
Enough
setup
","
here
is
a
minimal
working
example
:
Problem
Variant
1
does
not
work
at
all

the
queue
runner
threads
don't

run
.
print(threads)
outputs
something
like
[
<
"Thread(Thread-1, stopped daemon 140165838264064)"
>
","

Variant
2
does

something
like
[
<
"Thread(Thread-1, started daemon 140361854863104)"

.
But
since
load_input_data()
has
been
called
outside

","
batches
of

will
be
loaded

the
fact
that
I
am
trying

camera

how
I
am
accomplishing
this

As
you
can
see
that
I
am
using
the
IP
address
for
the
camera
.
This
works
perfectly
when
the
drone
is
not
connected
through
ROS
which
is
essentially
like
a
webcam
.
My
end
goal
is
for
tracking
and
navigation
through
the
use
of
images
received
from
the
camera
using
OpenCV
which
means
I
will
have
to
issue
movement
commands(cmd_vel)
which
requires
a
connection
through
ardrone_autonomy
based
on
the
images
received
and
processed
by
OpenCV
.
Is
there
anyway
I
can
accomplish
this
by
using
the
IP
camera
from
the
drone
while
connected
