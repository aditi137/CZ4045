I have this list and number:
list = ['B','C']

The outcome that I need for my table is:
B    C    Prob
0    0    x
0    1    x
1    0    x
1    1    x

How can I build this truth table (there can be more vairables, not only 3) and assign a number to that row's probability?
I need to build it with a dictionary, I tried with some list comprehension but I don't know how to generate dynamically the truth table, considering that there can be more/less than 3 variables.
EDIT: to be more clear my goal is to have a dictionary like this:
dict = {"B":0/1,"C":0/1,"Prob":arbitraryNumber}

and I need to insert all these dictionaries into a list to represent the structure of a table, is it clearer now?
Thank you very much
