I'm creating a telegram bot that searchs for words in a online dictionary, the problem comes when I need to create the command in Telegram for searching in that dictionary, at the momment I have this:
from rae import Drae
drae = Drae()

  if text.startswith('/'):
     if text =='/define':
        drae.search(u' ')  # The problem is here, I don't know how to implement the command and the word who the client wants to search.
        setEnabled(chat_id, True)


I'm using this Telegram API in Python: https://github.com/yukuku/telebot
And this API for the Dictionary: https://github.com/dialelo/rae-1
