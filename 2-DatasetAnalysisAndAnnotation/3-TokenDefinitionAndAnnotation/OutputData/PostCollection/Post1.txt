I am writing a simple Python for loop to prnt the current character in a string. However, I could not get the index of the character. Here is what I have, does anyone know a good way to get the current index of the character in the loop?
 loopme = 'THIS IS A VERY LONG STRING WITH MANY MANY WORDS!'

 for w  in loopme:
    print "CURRENT WORD IS " + w + " AT CHARACTER "
