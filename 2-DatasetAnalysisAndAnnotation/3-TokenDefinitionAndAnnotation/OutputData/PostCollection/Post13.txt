What about something like,
import csv

with open("file.csv", 'rb') as f:
    sl = []
    csvread = csv.reader(f, delimiter=' ')
    for line in csvread:
        sl.append(line.replace("C:/Abc/Def/Test/temp\.\test\GLNext\", ""))

To write the list sl out to filenew use,
with open('filenew.csv', 'wb') as f:
    csvwrite = csv.writer(f, delimiter=' ')
    for line in sl:
        csvwrite.writerow(line)
