I'm trying to implement an OAuth2 authentication server and for the client part i wanted to send a json request to the server (from a Django view) and i found several libraries to do that tho' the most common are httplib2 and urllib2 i was wondering which is the difference between them and which is the best library for this purpose.
Thanks in advance.
Edit:
After searching, i found an extremely useful library called Requests and i use this one since then. (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
