I'm trying to create a hyper link in python that includes string and variables but i keep getting a syntax error, I think its probably because of quotations but I cant seen to figure it out. Thanks for the help.
'<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?z=12&t=m&q=loc:'str(p['latitude']+'+'+str(p['longitude']))'">Click Here</a>'})
