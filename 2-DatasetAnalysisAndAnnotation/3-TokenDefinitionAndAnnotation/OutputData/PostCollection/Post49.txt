It means that for whatever reason, your account does not have permission to modify the contents of the .ipython folder, which IPython uses to store some settings and cache some data, so IPython will create and use a temporary directory instead.
To fix this, you should either modify the permissions on the .ipython folder from the command line and give yourself read/write permissions, or modify the IPYTHON_DIR environment variable to point to a folder you do have permissions for. 
Or, if you don't feel like fixing the error + don't mind that IPython is using a temp folder, don't do anything.
