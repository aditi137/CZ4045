Okay, i've used the API docs and found the problem.
The parameter you need to use to order the data is: "order=asc|desc", and not "sort_order" as previously thought.
Please use this function:
def download_contract_from_quandl(contract, dl_dir):
"""
Download an individual futures contract from Quandl and then
store it to disk in the 'dl_dir' directory. An auth_token is
required, which is obtained from the Quandl upon sign-up.
"""
# Construct the API call from the contract and auth_token
api_call = "https://www.quandl.com/api/v3/datasets/"
api_call += "CME/%s.csv" % contract
# If you wish to add an auth token for more downloads, simply
# comment the following line and replace MY_AUTH_TOKEN with
# your auth token in the line below
params = "?auth_token=YOUR_TOKEN"
params += "&order=asc"
full_url = "%s%s" % (api_call, params)

# Download the data from Quandl
data = requests.get(full_url).text
# Store the data to disk
fc = open('%s/%s.csv' % (dl_dir, contract), 'w')
fc.write(data)

Note:
The way you are using the api, by simple http request, altough works, is the not the ideal way to use their API.
There is a python package called Quandl, you can install like so:
pip3 install quandl

On your system.
Also then you would have a single (and not multiple using auth_token=YOUR_TOKEN in each request) auth call like so:
quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = 'YOUR_TOEKN'

And then each api call will be simple and elegent using their package instead or creating an http request manually, like so:
data = quandl.get("CME/ESH2010.csv", order="asc")

I will advise using the second method of using the API, but both will work perfectly.
Cheers, Or.
