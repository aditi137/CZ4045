Phil's answer really solved it, but I'll elaborate a little more. Since the epoch is in UTC, if I want to compare other times to the epoch, I need to interpret them as UTC as well.
By converting the time tuple to a timestamp treating is as UTC time, I get a number which is evenly divisible by the number of seconds in a day.
I can use this to convert a date to a days-from-the-epoch representation which is what I'm ultimately after.
