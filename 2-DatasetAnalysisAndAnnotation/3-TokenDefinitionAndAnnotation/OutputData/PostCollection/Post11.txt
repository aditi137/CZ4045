I have a file that I am currently reading from using
fo = open("file.txt", "r")

Then by doing
file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
file.write(fo.read())
file.write("Hello at the end of the file")
fo.close()
file.close()

I basically copy the file to a new one, but also add some text at the end of the newly created file. How would I be able to insert that line say, in between two lines separated by an empty line? I.e:
line 1 is right here
                        <---- I want to insert here
line 3 is right here

Can I tokenize different sentences by a delimiter like \n for new line?
