I think what you are trying to achieve is something like the following:
file1.py
from file2 import my_list

print(my_list)

file2.py
my_list = []

class abc:
    def __init__(self):
        global my_list

        my_list = [12,13,4] #values assigned


my_abc_file2 = abc()

Running file1.py would give:
[12, 13, 4]

As mentioned in the comments, file2.py really only needs to contain the following for it to work though:
file2.py
my_list = [12,13,4]

Tested in Python 2.7
