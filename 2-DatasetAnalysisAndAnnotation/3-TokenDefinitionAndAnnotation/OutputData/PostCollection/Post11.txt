Are you running Python on UNIX or Windows?
An alternative to mod_python and FastCGI is mod_wsgi. You can find out more at modwsgi
I have built and installed this on Solaris without problems. I had previously tried mod_python but ran into problems with shared libraries as part of the build. There are good install docs available.
