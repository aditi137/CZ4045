I'm trying to implement some sort of API on tornado and I have such question:
is it possible to route two urls to one handler separating by method.
class Handler():
   def get(self):
       #only for the first url
   def post(self):
       #only for the secornd url
handlers = [
   (r"/url1",Handler), #only GET are allowed
   (r"/url2",Handler), #only POST are allowed
]

So if someone trying to send POST to the first url he should see error message
