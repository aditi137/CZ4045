I have a function where I need to do something to a string.  I need the function to return a boolean indicating whether or not the operation succeeded, and I also need to return the modified string.  
In C#, I would use an out parameter for the string, but there is no equivalent in Python.  I'm still very new to Python and the only thing I can think of is to return a tuple with the boolean and modified string.
