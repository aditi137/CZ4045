I'm not a python guy but it looks like os.readlink()?  The logic I would use in perl is to use readlink() to find the target and the use stat() to test to see if the target exists.
Edit: I banged out some perl that demos readlink.  I believe perl's stat and readlink and python's os.stat() and os.readlink()are both wrappers for the system calls, so this should translate reasonable well as proof of concept code:
wembley 0 /home/jj33/swap > cat p
my $f = shift;

while (my $l = readlink($f)) {
  print "$f -> $l\n";
  $f = $l;
}

if (!-e $f) {
  print "$f doesn't exist\n";
}
wembley 0 /home/jj33/swap > ls -l | grep ^l
lrwxrwxrwx    1 jj33  users          17 Aug 21 14:30 link -> non-existant-file
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     users          31 Oct 10  2007 mm -> ../systems/mm/20071009-rewrite//
lrwxrwxrwx    1 jj33  users           2 Aug 21 14:34 mmm -> mm/
wembley 0 /home/jj33/swap > perl p mm
mm -> ../systems/mm/20071009-rewrite/
wembley 0 /home/jj33/swap > perl p mmm
mmm -> mm
mm -> ../systems/mm/20071009-rewrite/
wembley 0 /home/jj33/swap > perl p link
link -> non-existant-file
non-existant-file doesn't exist
wembley 0 /home/jj33/swap >
