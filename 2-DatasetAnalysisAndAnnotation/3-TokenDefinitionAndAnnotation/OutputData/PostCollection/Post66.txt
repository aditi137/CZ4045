One easy solution to the GIL is the multiprocessing module. It can be used as a drop in replacement to the threading module but uses multiple Interpreter processes instead of threads. Because of this there is a little more overhead than plain threading for simple things but it gives you the advantage of real parallelization if you need it.
It also easily scales to multiple physical machines.
If you need truly large scale parallelization than I would look further but if you just want to scale to all the cores of one computer or a few different ones without all the work that would go into implementing a more comprehensive framework, than this is for you.
