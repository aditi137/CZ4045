It seems that lxml does not expose this libxml2 feature, grepping the source only turns up some #defines for the error handling:
From the catalog implementation in libxml2 page it seems possible that the 'transparent' handling through installation in /etc/xml/catalog may still work in lxml, but if you need more than that you can always abandon lxml and use the default python bindings, which do expose the catalog functions.
