Don't use regular expressions just because they are there.
As Vincent points out, that assumes all words are seperated by whitespace.
Is probably a better options. Although whether that is neccesary depends on details not provided in your post.
EDIT
If you don't even care about word boundaries, there is even less reason to be using a regular expression.
