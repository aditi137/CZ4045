Given a set of points describing some trajectory in the 2D plane, I would like to provide a smooth representation of this trajectory with local high order interpolation. 
For instance, say we define a circle in 2D with 11 points in the figure below. I would like to add points in between each consecutive pair of points in order or produce a smooth trace. Adding points on every segment is easy enough, but it produces slope discontinuities typical for a "local linear interpolation". Of course it is not an interpolation in the classical sense, because
the function can have multiple y values for a given x 
simply adding more points on the trajectory would be fine (no continuous representation is needed).
so I'm not sure what would be the proper vocabulary for this.
The code to produce this figure can be found below. The linear interpolation is performed with the lin_refine_implicit function. I'm looking for a higher order solution to produce a smooth trace and I was wondering if there is a way of achieving it with classical functions in Scipy? I have tried to use various 1D interpolations from scipy.interpolate without much success (again because of multiple y values for a given x).
The end goals is to use this method to provide a smooth GPS trajectory from discrete measurements, so I would think this should have a classical solution somewhere.
