Building on Barry Wark's answer...
NSBeep() from AppKit works fine, but also makes the terminal/app icon in the taskbar jump.
A few extra lines with NSSound() avoids that and gives the opportunity to use another sound:
Standard sound files can be found via commandline locate /System/Library/Sounds/*.aiff
The file used by NSBeep() seems to be '/System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff'
