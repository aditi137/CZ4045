Here's a way of doing it without collections.Counter, as requested in chat:
def countLetters(word):
    d = {}
    for l in word:
        d[l] = d.get(l,0) + 1
    return d

def checkSubset(answer,letters):
    a, l = countLetters(answer), countLetters(letters)
    return all(l.get(x,0) >= a.get(x) for x in a.keys())

print(checkSubset('dog','odr'))
