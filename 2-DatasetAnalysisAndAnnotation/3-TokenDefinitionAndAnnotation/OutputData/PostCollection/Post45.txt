I think it has to do with how pymunk tries to find the path of chipmunk.dll when frozen. Apparently special code is required when it all packs into one file. Can you replace your libload.py file with this one and try again: https://gist.github.com/viblo/44ccd6af88d9f050403b 
(At the moment I cannot try this myself, therefor the gist. If it works Ill commit it to the real pymunk repo)
