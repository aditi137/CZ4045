The http://127.0.0.1:8000/song/299d8fe1-7d9f-434a-ba64-94fb7a16b1a6/gives me the desired page based on the uuid of the song and works fine.
(It's the second url.)
Here is the urls.py
The third url,
the one the arrow is pointing at, gives me a 404 error, with the message "No Song matches the given query."
I'm guessing there's an error with the regex, but I can't figure it out.
EDIT
Here are the views for both the song and song info:
