Add an optional quantifier ? to the value part so that it is matched zero or one time
Changes made
Moved the = to a non capturing group (?:..)
(?:=(?P<val>.+))? Matched zero or one time. This is ensured by the ?. That is it checks if =value can be matched (capturing only the value part). If not None is captured.
