you don't want the future flag if you're working from the deformable object:
targetMesh = "pSphere1"    
blendshapes = cmds.ls(*cmds.listHistory(targetMesh) or [], type= 'blendShape')

To get the actual shapes, you'd add
source_shapes =  cmds.ls(*cmds.listHistory(*blendshapes) or [], type= 'mesh', ni=True)
