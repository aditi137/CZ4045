(I'm trying to comment on people suggesting to roll their own Calendar widget, but either I don't see the comment button, or I don't have enough rep.)
What happened to DRY? I think it would be best to re-use the admin widget, but perhaps it should be separated from admin, and easier to use. Thanks for this information anyways.
