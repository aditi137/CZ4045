I installed lxml on a mac and trying to use it in my code and I get errors importing tostring and tounicode. Python cannot see it at all. Any ideas what I am doing wrong?
Here is the code that is causing problems - 
I get an unresolved import error 
Also my IDE (eclipse) is able to see the init.py file for lxml.etree module. Here is what it sees ---
Thanks for any help.
EDIT:
The only log I see is 
    Unresolved import: tostring
    Unresolved import: tounicode
And when I add the following line before the import of tostring it works no errors --
    import etree from lxml
Also to give you some more background on what I am trying to do. I got the readability code from here (https://github.com/buriy/python-readability) and trying to use it in my project. 
EDIT2: I fixed the problem but still do not understand why. I wanted to use the code from the readability project directly without installing the package using easy_install. The idea was step into the code so that I understand what its doing. But when I copy the code into my project I get the above mentioned error in the readability code. If I install the package using easy_install then all I can simply import the class exported by readability and use it.
So can some one tell me what the difference is between using the code directly and the package installed? What is a .egg file? How to create one?
