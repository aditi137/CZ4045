If the program works and the speed is acceptable, I wouldn't change it.
Otherwise, you could try unutbu's answer.
Generally, I would leave away the 
png = "png"
jpg = "jpg"

stuff as I don't see any purpose in not using the strings directly.
And better test for ".png" instead of "png".
An even better solution would be to define 
extensions = ('.png', '.jpg')

somewhere centally and use that in
if any(currentFile.endswith(ext) for ext in extensions):
    os.remove(currentFile)

.
