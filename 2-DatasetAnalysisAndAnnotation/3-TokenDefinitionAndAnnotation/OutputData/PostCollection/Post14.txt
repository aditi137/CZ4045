Here's how I'd write it:
search = re.compile(r'^The.*said').search
match = search(input)
if match:
    match = match.group(0)

If input is "The cat said my name", match will be "The cat said".
If input is "The cat never mentioned my name", match will be None.
I really like the fact that Python makes it possible to compile a regular expression and assign the particular method of interest to a variable in one line.
