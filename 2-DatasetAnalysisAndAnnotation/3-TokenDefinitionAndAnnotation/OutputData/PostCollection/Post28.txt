OK, what you need is classobj from new module. That would allow you to construct exception classes dynamically (classobj takes a string as an argument for the class name). 
this gives you:
remember that you can always get the class name through:
So, after some string mangling and concatenation, you should be able to obtain appropriate exception class name and construct a class object using that name and then raise that exception.
P.S. - you can also raise strings, but this is deprecated.
