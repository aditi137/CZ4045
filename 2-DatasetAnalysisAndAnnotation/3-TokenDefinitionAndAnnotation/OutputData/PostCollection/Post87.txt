I don't think that your results are all that surprising -- if anything it is that Postgres is so fast.
Does the Postgres query run faster a second time once it has had a chance to cache the data?  To be a little fairer your test for Java and Python should cover the cost of acquiring the data in the first place (ideally loading it off disk).
If this performance level is a problem for your application in practice but you need a RDBMS for other reasons then you could look at memcached.  You would then have faster cached access to raw data and could do the calculations in code.
