EDIT: 
The following print shows my intended value.
(both sys.stdout.encoding and sys.stdin.encoding are 'UTF-8').
Why is the variable value different than its print value? I need to get the raw value into a variable.
>>username = 'Jo\xc3\xa3o'
>>username.decode('utf-8').encode('latin-1')
'Jo\xe3o'
>>print username.decode('utf-8').encode('latin-1')

Original question:
I'm having an issue querying a BD and decoding the values into Python.
I confirmed my DB NLS_LANG using
select property_value from database_properties where property_name='NLS_CHARACTERSET';

'''AL32UTF8 stores characters beyond U+FFFF as four bytes (exactly as Unicode defines 
UTF-8). Oracle’s “UTF8” stores these characters as a sequence of two UTF-16 surrogate
characters encoded using UTF-8 (or six bytes per character)'''

os.environ["NLS_LANG"] = ".AL32UTF8"

....
conn_data = str('%s/%s@%s') % (db_usr, db_pwd, db_sid)

sql = "select user_name apex.users where user_id = '%s'" % userid

...

cursor.execute(sql)
ldap_username = cursor.fetchone()
...

where 
print ldap_username
>>'Jo\xc3\xa3o'

I've both tried (which return the same)
ldap_username.decode('utf-8')
>>u'Jo\xe3o'
unicode(ldap_username, 'utf-8')
>>u'Jo\xe3o'

where
u'João'.encode('utf-8')
>>'Jo\xc3\xa3o'

how to get the queries result back to the proper 'João' ?
