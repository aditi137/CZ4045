I'm using Cygwin and Python2.7 and I have already installed some third party modules (PySide, PyGame) on my computer and when I run them using the normal GUI they work fine. But when I run python inside Cygwin it doesn't recognize the modules I already have installed. I'm using Windows 7 for this. Is there anyway I can get Cygwin to recognize these libraries?
