If you can hook your authentication into the Django authentication scheme you'll be able to use request.user.
I think this should just be a case of calling authenticate() and login() based on the contents of your Cookie.
Edit: @Staale - I always use the locals() trick for my context so all my templates can see request and so request.user.  If you're not then I guess it wouldn't be so straightforward.
