In a Keras model with the Functional API I need to call fit_generator to train on augmented images data using an ImageDataGenerator.
The problem is my model has two outputs: the mask I'm trying to predict and a binary value
I obviously only want to augment the input and the mask output and not the binary value.
How can I achieve this?
