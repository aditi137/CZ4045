Spacy gives you all of that with just using en_nlp = spacy.load('en'); doc=en_nlp(sentence). The documentation gives you details about how to access each of the elements.
An example is given below:
Sentences can be obtained by using doc.sents:
Noun chunks are given by doc.noun_chunks:
Named entity is given by doc.ents:
Tokenization: You can iterate over the doc to get tokens. token.orth_ gives str of the token.
POS is given by token.tag_:
Lemmatization:
Dependency parsing. You can traverse the parse tree by using token.dep_ token.rights or token.lefts. You can write a function to print dependencies:
For more details please consult the spacy documentation.
