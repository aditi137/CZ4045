Why is it that I cannot access the attribute of an object as seen in the following example? (raises an error)
class X(object):
def __init__(self):
    self.y = Y(self)
    self.variable = 5

class Y(object):
    def __init__(self,parent):
        self.parent = parent
        print self.parent.variable

my_instance = X()

Error raised: AttributeError: 'X' object has no attribute 'variable'
Shouldn't variable be accessible to the instance of Y that is created when X is initialized?
