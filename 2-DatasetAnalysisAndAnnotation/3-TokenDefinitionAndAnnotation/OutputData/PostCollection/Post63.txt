Setting choices on the field will allow some validation on the Django end, but it won't define any form of an enumerated type on the database end.
As others have mentioned, the solution is to specify db_type on a custom field.
If you're using a SQL backend (e.g. MySQL), you can do this like so:
Run syncdb, and inspect your table to see that the ENUM was created properly.
