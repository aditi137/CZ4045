I am developing a plugin in qgis. I have one interface (MMMM.py) with several buttons and one of them opens a new interface (ABC.py) where I introduce values. My objective is to read these values in the main interface (the first one). So I have a script to each interface but when I import the variables, I have several errors. I have troubles to import these variables.
second script named ABC.py
first (main) script named MMMM.py
I tried some ways to import the values x and y to main interface but I have always errors. I am working in qgis.
What I am doing wrong?
