You might want to use pyserial, which  uses the kernel interfaces (I don't know what PyBBIO does). It provides automatic input buffering - so you don't need an extra process. If you do want to have more processes use multiprocessing. A simpler alternative is threading, which saves you the communication part. For multiprocessing with network support use Ipython's cluster
