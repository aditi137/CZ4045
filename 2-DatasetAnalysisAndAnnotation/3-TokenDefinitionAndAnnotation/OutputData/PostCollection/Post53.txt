If item_info is a RawQuerySet, try {% if item_info.all %} instead of {% if item_info %}. RawQuerySet does not define a __bool__() method, so the instances are always considered True. See the warnings in this section of the docs, repeated below, just in case this link dies in the future:

While a RawQuerySet instance can be iterated over like a normal
  QuerySet, RawQuerySet doesnâ€™t implement all methods you can use with
  QuerySet. For example, bool() and len() are not defined in
  RawQuerySet, and thus all RawQuerySet instances are considered True.
  The reason these methods are not implemented in RawQuerySet is that
  implementing them without internal caching would be a performance
  drawback and adding such caching would be backward incompatible.
