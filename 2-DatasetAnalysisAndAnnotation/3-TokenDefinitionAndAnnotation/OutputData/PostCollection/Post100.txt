I am working on a project that requires me to read a spreadsheet provided by the user and I need to build a system to check that the contents of the spreadsheet are valid. Specifically I want to validate that each column contains a specific datatype.
I know that this could be done by iterating over every cell in the spreadsheet, but I was hoping there is a simpler way to do it.
