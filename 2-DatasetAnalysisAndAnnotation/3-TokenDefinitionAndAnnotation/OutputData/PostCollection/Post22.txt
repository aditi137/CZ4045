When I tried to run this code, I got an overflow error. I suspect you're having the same problem, but for some reason, it's not throwing an error. 
If you scale down the features, everything works as expected. Using scipy.stats.linregress:
Using linear_model.SGDRegressor:
The value for slope is a little lower, but I'd guess that's because of the regularization.
