Define a helper function and pass the object method and its arguments to that function via Pool.map. The helper function would look something like this:
def helper(*args):
    return args[0](*args[1:])

And you would use it like this:
pool = Pool()
results = pool.map(helper, [obj.method, arg1, arg2])

Note that the helper function must be directly importable from its containing module.
