I have a main python script which starts a thread running in the background.
poll = threading.Thread(target=poll_files, args=myargs)
I want my main script to wait until something specific happens in my poll thread. I want to use an Event object. So in my main script, I do:
trigger = threading.Event()
and when I want to wait:
trigger.wait()
My question is, inside my poll thread, how do I set the Event to True? I know I do:
trigger.set()
but do I need to also have trigger = threading.Event() inside my poll thread?
