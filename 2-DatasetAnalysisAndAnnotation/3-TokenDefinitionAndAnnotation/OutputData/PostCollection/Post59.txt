There're currently two github projects based on adding these, though I've not looked into exactly how they're implemented:
Django-EnumField:
Provides an enumeration Django model field (using IntegerField) with reusable enums and transition validation. 
Django-EnumFields:
This package lets you use real Python (PEP435-style) enums with Django.
I don't think either use DB enum types, but they are in the works for first one.
