As I commented above, this should not be used on untrusted sources. Also it may not me explicit enough to be Pythonic.
One can also define a function to do that, but to access the right locals, it needs to do some frame handling
def format_locals(string):
    return string.format(**sys._getframe().f_back.f_locals)

This kind of pattern is not nice and things like Pypy can't optmize this kind of code.
I would use this code (unless you need Python 2.6 support so you must add the indexes):
filename = 'data/avatars/{}.{}'.format(player_name, ext)
