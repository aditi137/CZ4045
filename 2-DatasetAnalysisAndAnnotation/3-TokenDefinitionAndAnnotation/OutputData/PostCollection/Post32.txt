My data looks like:
{12,} {13,} {10,}
{16,} {17, 15,} {22,}
{27,} {28,24,29,} {28,} {28,}

Each line is a sequence. For each line, if multiple numbers occur in {  }, I want to sort them in each bracket(ascending sort ), while keeping the order of the rest. At last, I want to remove the brackets. So I want my output to be like this:
12, 13, 10
16, 15, 17, 22
27, 24, 28, 29, 28, 28

My thought was converting each line into a list, but then I was totally stuck.
