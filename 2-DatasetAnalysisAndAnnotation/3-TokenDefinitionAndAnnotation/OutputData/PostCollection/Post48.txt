I don't get this part here:

This worked okay, but there was no easy way of checking if x[3][24] was supposed to exist or not (so I couldn't raise the season_not_found exception)

There is a way to do it - called in:
>>>x={}
>>>x[1]={}
>>>x[1][2]={}
>>>x
{1: {2: {}}}
>>> 2 in x[1]
True
>>> 3 in x[1]
False

what seems to be the problem with that?
