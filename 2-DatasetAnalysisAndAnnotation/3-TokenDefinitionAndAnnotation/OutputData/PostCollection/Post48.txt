Use collections.Counter() to convert x and y to multi-sets, then subtract to see if all of y's letters can be found in x:
from collections import Counter

def checkYinX(y, x):
    return not (Counter(y) - Counter(x))

Subtracting multi-sets removes characters when their count falls to 0. If this results in an empty multi-set, it becomes False in a boolean context, like all 'empty' python types. not turns that into True if that is the case.
Demo:
>>> x = "dsjcosnag"
>>> y = "dog"
>>> print(checkYinX(y,x))
True
>>> print(checkYinX('cat',x))
False
