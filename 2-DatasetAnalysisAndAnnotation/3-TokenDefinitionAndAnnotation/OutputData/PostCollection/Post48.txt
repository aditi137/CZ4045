I'm not a python guy but it looks like os.readlink()?  The logic I would use in perl is to use readlink() to find the target and the use stat() to test to see if the target exists.
Edit: I banged out some perl that demos readlink.  I believe perl's stat and readlink and python's os.stat() and os.readlink()are both wrappers for the system calls, so this should translate reasonable well as proof of concept code:
