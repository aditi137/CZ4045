I've installed Ninja IDE on two Windows machines, a Windows 7 machine with only standard Python 3 installed where it gives me that error you mentioned.
And a Windows XP machine on which I had pythonxy which comes with PyQt in a convenient easy to use installer thus it worked without any further troubles.
