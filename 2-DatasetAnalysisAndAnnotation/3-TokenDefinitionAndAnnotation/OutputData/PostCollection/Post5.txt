EDIT
This is my code:
It's working as it should within python, so I compiled it to .exe using Pyinstaller.
I managed to have an exe file now but I'm struggling with the import of pyperclip.
the exe works except for that last command. I tried -p dir and also --hidden-import pyperclip.
I ran it with -d and the debug I get is:
I'm not sure how to proceed right now :\ any input?
