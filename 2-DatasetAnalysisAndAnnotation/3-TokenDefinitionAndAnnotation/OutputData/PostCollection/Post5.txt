If a worker name can't include a space, you can check that and change the behavior accordingly.
This will even work if the user combine the 2 options (e.g. entering 'a' and then 'b c'), although it is not perfect (it is possible to get more than n names, for example if n == 3 and inputting 'a b' and 'c d')
n = int(input("enter the no of workers \n"))
print("enter the names of workers")
NameList = []
while len(NameList) < n:
    worker_name = input()
    if ' ' in worker_name:
        if NameList:
            NameList.extend(worker_name.split())
        else:
            NameList = worker_name.split()
    else:
        NameList.append(worker_name)
print(NameList)
