The best sell of Python I've ever seen was by a manager in our group who had a young daughter.  He used a quote attributed to Einstein:
If you can't explain something to a six-year-old, you really don't understand it yourself.
The next few slides of his presentation demonstrated how he was able to teach his young daughter some basic Python in less than 30 minutes, with examples of the code she wrote and an explanation of what it did.
He ended the presentation with a picture of his daughter and her quote "Programming is fun!"
I would focus on Python's user friendliness and wealth of libraries and frameworks.  There are also a lot of little libraries that you might not get in other languages, and would have to write yourself (i.e. How a C++ developer writes Python).
Good luck!
