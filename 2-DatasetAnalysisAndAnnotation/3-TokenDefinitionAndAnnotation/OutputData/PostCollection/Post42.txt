I had to turn off the "Silence terminal bell" option in my active Terminal Profile in iTerm for print('\a') to work. It seemed to work fine by default in Terminal.
You can also use the Mac module Carbon.Snd to play the system beep:
The Carbon modules don't have any documentation, so I had to use help(Carbon.Snd) to see what functions were available. It seems to be a direct interface onto Carbon, so the docs on Apple Developer Connection probably help.
