I am working with a big set of data (240, 131000) and bigger. I am currently using the code below to plot this.
fig,ax = pyplot.subplots()
spectrum = ax.pcolor(waterfallplot, cmap='viridis')
pyplot.colorbar()
pyplot.show()

However, it's taking a very long time (30 min+) and the plot still hasn't shown up yet. A quick breakpoint check says the code gets to the spectrum= line, but doesn't go past. Looking at the memory on my computer, it hasn't even gotten close to the limit. 
Does anyone have a better way of doing this?
