An other very good documentation tool is sphinx. It will be used for the upcoming python 2.6 documentation and is used by django and a lot of other python projects.
From the sphinx website:

Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help) and LaTeX, for printable PDF versions
Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children
Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
Extensions: automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings from Python modules, and more
