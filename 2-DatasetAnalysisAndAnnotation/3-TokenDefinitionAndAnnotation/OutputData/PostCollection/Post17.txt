You want to use itertools.groupby() with a dash of itertools.islice() and itertools.chain:
The groupby() call groups the input list into chunks where the first item is the same (itemgetter(0) is the grouping key). 
The islice(group, 1, None) call turns the groups into iterables where the first element will be skipped.
The chain.from_iterable() call takes each islice() result and chains them together into a new iterable, which list() turns back into a list.
