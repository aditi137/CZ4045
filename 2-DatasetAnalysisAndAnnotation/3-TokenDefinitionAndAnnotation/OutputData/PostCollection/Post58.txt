This might do the trick:
(?=[\w:])(\w*)(?::(\w*))?

(\w*)(?::(\w*))? describes the structure you want, but it has a problem that it also matches empty string; thus we have to assure that there is at least one non-space character at the start (which will get matched by the greedy operators), and the lookahead at the start does it.
Edit: wrong paste :)
