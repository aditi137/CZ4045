I like doxygen to create documentation of C or PHP code. I have an upcoming Python project and I think I remember that Python doesn't have /* .. */ comments and also has its own self-documentation facility which seems to be the pythonic way to document.
Can I just use doxygen? Anything particular to be aware of?
I have done some coding in Python but so far only on small projects where I was to lazy to document at all (yeah, I know ... but let's just pretend that's OK for now).
