I'm testing a web application using Django-nose to monitor the code coverage. At first it worked perfectly well, but when trying to generate HTML it fails with the error:
Imput error: No module named copy_reg
It happened after a few times (until then in worked). I tried it on a computer with newly installed django, django-nose and coverage and the very same code works fine. Re-installing django and django-nose didn't help.
Any suggestions? Should I re-install any library or something?
Thank you in advance!
