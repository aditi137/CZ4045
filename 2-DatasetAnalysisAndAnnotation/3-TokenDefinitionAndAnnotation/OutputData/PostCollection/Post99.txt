There's nothing wrong with using a command line utility to do what you want. If you put a nice wrapper around the service, you can implement the internals however you want! For example:
Now, whether or not you roll your own using urllib, wrap around a command line utility (like you're doing), or import a third party library and use that (like you're saying), this interface stays the same.
This approach is generally not considered ugly at all -- sometimes command utilities do what you want and you should be able to leverage them. If speed ends up being a bottleneck, your abstraction makes the process of switching to a native Python implementation transparent to your client code.
Practicality beats purity -- that's what's Pythonic. :)
