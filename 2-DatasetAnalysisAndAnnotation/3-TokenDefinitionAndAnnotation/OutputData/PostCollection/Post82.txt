You can consider changing your backend to TkAgg in the Python 2 virtualenv by running the following:
sudo apt install python-tk  # install Python 2 bindings for Tk
pip --no-cache-dir install -U --force-reinstall matplotlib  # reinstall matplotlib   

To confirm the backend is indeed TkAgg, run
python -c 'import matplotlib as mpl; print(mpl.get_backend())'

and you should see TkAgg.
