As an aside: When using functions instead of methods, you could also use functools.partial:
import functools

def foo(arg, **kwargs):
    ...

bar = functools.partial(foo, "argvalue")

The last line will define a function "bar" that, when called, will call foo with the first argument set to "argvalue" and all other functions just passed on:
bar(5, myarg="value")

will call
foo("argvalue", 5, myarg="value")

Unfortunately that will not work with methods.
