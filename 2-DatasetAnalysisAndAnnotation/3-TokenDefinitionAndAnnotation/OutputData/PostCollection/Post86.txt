I am using Boto in Python to connect to Amazon MWS. I have successfully connected using their scripts but am having trouble parsing the response as I don't fully understand the documentation, and there are little to no examples on the internet. I am new to Python.
Here is how I get my response from MWS:
The first product gives a response of this:
My Issue is trying to get the details from the ItemAttributes:
At this point I believe it is a dictionary object.
As I am new to this language I can't figure out how to get all the information that is located in the () such as Brand, Studio, etc.
Boto has some built in functions such as Response and ResponseFactory, but I am lost again as I keep hitting a wall trying to get info such as Brand, etc..
Thank you again for any help you can give in this.
