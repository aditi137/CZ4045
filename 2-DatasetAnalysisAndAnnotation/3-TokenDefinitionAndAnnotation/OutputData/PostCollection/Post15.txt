I'm downloading an entire directory from a web server. It works OK, but I can't figure how to get the file size before download to compare if it was updated on the server or not. Can this be done as if I was downloading the file from a FTP server?
@Jon: thank for your quick answer. It works, but the filesize on the web server is slightly less than the filesize of the downloaded file. 
Examples:
It has anything to do with the CR/LF conversion?
