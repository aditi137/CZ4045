A common practice is to put the tests directory in the same parent directory as your module/package. So if your module was called foo.py your directory layout would look like:
Of course there is no one way of doing it. You could also make a tests subdirectory and import the module using absolute import.
Wherever you put your tests, I would recommend you use nose to run them. Nose searches through your directories for tests. This way, you can put tests wherever they make the most sense organizationally.
