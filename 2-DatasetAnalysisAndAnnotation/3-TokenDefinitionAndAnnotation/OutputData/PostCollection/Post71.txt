Try to remember that the GIL is set to poll around every so often in order to do show the appearance of multiple tasks. This setting can be fine tuned, but I offer the suggestion that there should be work that the threads are doing or lots of context switches are going to cause problems.
I would go so far as to suggest multiple parents on processors and try to keep like jobs on the same core(s).
