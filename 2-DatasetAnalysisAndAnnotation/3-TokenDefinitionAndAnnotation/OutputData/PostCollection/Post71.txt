This answer is too late as a solution has already been accepted, but the simplest way to solve the  problem is to write the newly-constructed row directly to the output csv file without creating an intermediate list.
You could write something like:
import csv, math

with open("mydata.csv", "rb") as f,\
     open("newdata.csv", "wb") as g:
        vectors = csv.reader(f, delimiter=";")
        writer = csv.writer(g, delimiter=";")
        for row in vectors:
            # use destructuring
            x, y, dX, dY, magnitude = map(float, row)

            if dX > 0 and dY > 0:
            #<snip>

            # at this stage you can write directly to the output
            # file.
            writer.writerow([x, y, dX, dY, magnitude, angle])
