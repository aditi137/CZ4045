You implemented a naive matrix multiplication algorithm, which scipy.weave compiles to fast machine code.
However, there are non-obvious, more CPU cache efficient algorithms for matrix multiplication (which usually split the matrix into blocks and deal with those), and additional speed can be gained with CPU-specific optimizations. Numpy by default uses an optimized BLAS library for this operation, if you have one installed. These libraries will likely be fast compared to anything you can code up yourself without doing an amount of research.
