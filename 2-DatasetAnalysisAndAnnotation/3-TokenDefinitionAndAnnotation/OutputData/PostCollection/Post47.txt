I should have warned you more thouroghly: wxPython Phoenix is the future of wxPython (because, in contrast to classic it supports Python 3, too). That said, this does not mean everything is nice and shiny. My personal advice is to keep on going with classic (or in other words: what works now in classic, will most probably also work in Phoenix). In Phoenix, you will stumble into bugs like this more often.
Luckily, in this special case, there has already been something else done:
<wx.TextCtrl>.AutoComplete(â€¦) does accept a list of strings. This already works in 2.9.0/classic. See documentation for wx.TextEntry/AutoComplete.
