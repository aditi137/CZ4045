Say I have the following methods:
def methodA(arg, **kwargs):
    pass

def methodB(arg, *args, **kwargs):
    pass

In methodA I wish to call methodB, passing on the kwargs. However, it seems that if I define methodA as follows, the second argument will be passed on as positional rather than named variable arguments.
def methodA(arg, **kwargs):
    methodB("argvalue", kwargs)

How do I make sure that the **kwargs in methodA gets passed as **kwargs to methodB?
