Ok - with a bit more time spent I've managed to find a solution that worked for me:
for every key in the error dictionary submit the form and loop through and check for errors present
and then return "Fail" if there are 1 or more errors and "Pass" if no errors present
errorCount is defined outside of the whole form loop and I also reset the errorCount after each form loop is completed.
The exception clause is in there just so my script doesn't fail over when it can't find an error from the error dictionary.
