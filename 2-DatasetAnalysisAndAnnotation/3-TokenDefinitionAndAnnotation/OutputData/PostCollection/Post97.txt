For those using GUI (navigator), select Environments > root. On the right is a list of packages - installed, not installed, etc. 
Select "not installed", search for seaborn. If it appears, then click the row, and select Apply button at bottom of that page.
If it doesn't appear, then something else is wrong with your install.
Hope that helps.
