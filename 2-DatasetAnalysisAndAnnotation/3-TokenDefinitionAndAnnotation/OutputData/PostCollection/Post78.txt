To allow the user to interact with the desktop in real-time, you need to run the application in the users web browser. Interaction with a webserver would just be too slow to do anything meaningful. I do not know about any way to execute Python in a web browser, so I would rule it out. Some of your options for client-sided code execution are:
Javascript (the recent addition of Canvas and WebSocket made it suitable for this kind of problem)
Java Applets (felt out of favor recently due to security problems)
ActiveX (IE- and Windows only, very rarely used in a public context nowadays)
Flash (a popular but dying technology)
