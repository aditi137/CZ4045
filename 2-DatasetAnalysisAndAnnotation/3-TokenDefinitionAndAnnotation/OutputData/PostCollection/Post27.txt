Normally on the linux front, if the usb dongle is of the right type, you will see something like /dev/usbserial or similar device. Maybe check dmesg after plugging the cable.
(on linux you can run find /dev | grep usb to list all usb related devices)
Just a side note, I've seen the beaglebone has an ethernet port, why not just using a network socket? It's all easier than reinventing a protocol on usb.
