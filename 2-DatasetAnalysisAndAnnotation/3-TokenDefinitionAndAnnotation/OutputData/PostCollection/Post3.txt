I am just very curious. Django runs the following line:
email_body = get_template("applicant/email_with_token.txt").render(Context())

it runs it from form_valid() of a class-based view. New context is created based on a regular python dictionary. No parameters are passed, that come from a view, user, session, etc... Inside of the template there is {% load i18n %} and a bunch of context/variables.
Still, Django recognizes the language of the current session and applies appropriate translations.
So, where from does it know the session language?
