PyPy translator is in general, not intended for more public use. We use it for translating
our own python interpreter (including JIT and GCs, both written in RPython, this restricted
subset of Python). The idea is that with good JIT and GC, you'll be able to speedups even
without knowing or using PyPy's translation toolchain (and more importantly, without
restricting yourself to RPython).
