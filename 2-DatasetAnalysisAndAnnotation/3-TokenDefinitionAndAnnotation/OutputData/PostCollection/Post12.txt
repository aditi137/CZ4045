My solution was to set up the module like this:
The setup.py would contain something similar to this:
and the file a.py would contain the following lines in the header:
The way it works is very simple: if you don't do anything (i.e. if you don't compile the cython files) then module a.py imports module b.py; however, if you run python setup.py build_ext --inplace then the compiled cython files will appear inside cython_my_module and the next time you run a.py it will automatically import the cython module b.pyx (actually it will import the compiled library b.so).
So far it seems to work and requires almost no effort. Hope it helps.
fish2000 solution seems more generic but I haven't tried it yet.
