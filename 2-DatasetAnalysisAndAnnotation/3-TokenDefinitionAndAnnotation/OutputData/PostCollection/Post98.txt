You're over-thinking this and confusing yourself. This appears to be a representation of a directed graph: it looks like edges is a list of Edges, and each Edge has a headNodeId and a tailNodeId. Each of those IDs refers to a Node in the nodes list.
So all that's happening when you say nodes[ edges[-1].headNodeId ] is "give me the item from 'nodes' whose index is the head node ID of the last item in 'edges'". Then, the code is simply calling addInEdge on that Node.
A much more verbose version of this would be:
