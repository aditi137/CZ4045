Basically I want to get the number of lines-of-code in the repository after each commit.
The only (really crappy) ways I have found is to use git filter-branch to run wc -l *, and a script that runs git reset --hard on each commit, then runs wc -l
To make it a bit clearer, when the tool is run, it would output the lines of code of the very first commit, then the second and so on. This is what I want the tool to output (as an example):
I've played around with the ruby 'git' library, but the closest I found was using the .lines() method on a diff, which seems like it should give the added lines (but does not: it returns 0 when you delete lines for example)
