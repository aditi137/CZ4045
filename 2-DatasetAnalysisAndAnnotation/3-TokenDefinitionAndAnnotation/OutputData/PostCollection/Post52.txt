This is not atomic but it works.
os.path.islink(filename) and not os.path.exists(filename)
Indeed by RTFM
 (reading the fantastic manual) we see
os.path.exists(path)
Return True if path refers to an existing path. Returns False for  broken symbolic links.
It also says:
On some platforms, this function may return False if permission is not granted to execute os.stat() on the requested file, even if the path physically exists.
So if you are worried about permissions, you should add other clauses.
