I can test the rank of a matrix using np.linalg.matrix_rank(A) . But how can I test if all the rows of A are orthogonal efficiently?
I could take all pairs of rows and compute the inner product between them but is there a better way?
My matrix has fewer rows than columns and the rows are not unit vectors.
