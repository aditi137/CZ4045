I have a question regarding Python ASCII Art.
User inputs 6.
XXXXXX
X    X
XX  XX
XX  XX
X    X
XXXXXX

User inputs 8.
XXXXXXXX
X      X
X      X
XXX  XXX
XXX  XXX
X      X
X      X
XXXXXXXX

How would I craft something like this in Python 3, using input from the user?
Could someone point me in the right direction. I just started learning python at home. This is one of the questions in the bonus quiz section of a book I purchased from Amazon.
