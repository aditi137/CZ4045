I have two Python dictionaries, and I want to write a single expression that returns these two dictionaries, merged.  The update() method would be what I need, if it returned its result instead of modifying a dict in-place.
>>> x = {'a':1, 'b': 2}
>>> y = {'b':10, 'c': 11}
>>> z = x.update(y)
>>> print(z)
None
>>> x
{'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 11}

How can I get that final merged dict in z, not x?
(To be extra-clear, the last-one-wins conflict-handling of dict.update() is what I'm looking for as well.)
