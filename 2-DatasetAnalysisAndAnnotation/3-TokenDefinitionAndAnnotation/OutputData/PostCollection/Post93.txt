I find myself referencing this post a lot, and found that the documentation defines a slightly less hacky way to override default widgets. 
(No need to override the ModelForm's __init__ method)
However, you still need to wire your JS and CSS appropriately as Carl mentions.
forms.py
Reference Field Types to find the default form fields.
