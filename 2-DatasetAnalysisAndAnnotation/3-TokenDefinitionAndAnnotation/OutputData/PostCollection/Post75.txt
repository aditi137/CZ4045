I have a list of lists m which I need to modify
I need that the sum of each row to be greater than A and the sum of each column to be lesser than B 
I have something like this
x = 5     #or other number, not relevant
rows = len(m)
cols = len(m[0])

for r in range(rows): 
    while sum(m[r]) < A:  
        c = randint(0, cols-1)
        m[r][c] += x 

for c in range(cols): 
    cant = sum([m[r][c] for r in range(rows)])
    while cant > B:
        r = randint(0, rows-1)
        if m[r][c] >= x:  #I don't want negatives
            m[r][c] -= x

My problem is: I need to satisfy both conditions and, this way, after the second for I won't be sure if the first condition is still met.
Any suggestions on how to satisfy both conditions and, of course, with the best execution? I could definitely consider the use of numpy
Edit (an example)
#input
m = [[0,0,0],
    [0,0,0]]
A = 20
B = 25

# one desired output (since it chooses random positions)
m = [[10,0,15],
    [15,0,5]]

I may need to add 
This is for the generation of the random initial population of a genetic algorithm, the restrictions are to make them a possible solution, and I would need to run this like 80 times to get different possible solutions
