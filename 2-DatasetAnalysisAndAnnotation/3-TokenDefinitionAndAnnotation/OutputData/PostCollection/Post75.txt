I have a simple scrapy project. I am crawling www.anthropologie.com for sale items. I want to use the standard imagePipeline to download the sale items I am scraping. I have enabled the standard imagePipeline in the settings.py file as well as a valid directory for the IMAGE_STORE. I have the required fields image_url and images. My spider is scrapping the correct url for the images as validated by checking the urls in the browser. When I run the spider it is indicated that the pipeline is enabled. However I see no indication that images are being downloaded and I find no images in the correct directory.
below are examples of my code:
settings.py:
items.py
anthro_spider.py:
there are no errors reported so I can't figure out what I'm missing.
