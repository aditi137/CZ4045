I've recently started to program in Python, so I've not really had chance to find out best practice yet.
But, I've written a module that goes and finds all the tests and runs them.
So, I have:

app/
 appfile.py
test/
 appfileTest.py

I'll have to see how it goes as I progress to larger projects.
