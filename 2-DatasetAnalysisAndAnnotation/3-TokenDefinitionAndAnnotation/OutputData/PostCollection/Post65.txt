I've written a Python package that includes a bsddb database of pre-computed values for one of the more time-consuming computations.  For simplicity, my setup script installs the database file in the same directory as the code which accesses the database (on Unix, something like /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/mypackage/).
How do I store the final location of the database file so my code can access it?  Right now, I'm using a hack based on the __file__ variable in the module which accesses the database:
dbname = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "database.dat")
It works, but it seems... hackish.  Is there a better way to do this?  I'd like to have the setup script just grab the final installation location from the distutils module and stuff it into a "dbconfig.py" file that gets installed alongside the code that accesses the database.
