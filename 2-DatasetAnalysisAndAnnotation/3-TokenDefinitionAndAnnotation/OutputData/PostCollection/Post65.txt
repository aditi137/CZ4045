I've been having a hard time trying to understand PyPy's translation.  It looks like something absolutely revolutionary from simply reading the description, however I'm hard-pressed to find good documentation on actually translating a real world piece of code to something such as LLVM.  Does such a thing exist?  The official PyPy documentation on it just skims over the functionality, rather than providing anything I can try out myself.
