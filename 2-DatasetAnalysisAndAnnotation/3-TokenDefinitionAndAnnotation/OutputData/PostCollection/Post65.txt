Option 1: For sendmailR, it seems that you're having issues with the appending of port 25.  You should be able to specify the destination port via sendmail_options(smtpPort = 587), prior to using the sendmail() command.
I am not sure that this will resolve your other issues, but it should get you the right port.
Option 2: If you'd like to invoke a Python script, this one looks most relevant.  You may find it easiest to do token substitution, i.e. take a base script, put in strings that you'll simply find (i.e. the tokens) & replace (i.e. substitution with your desired strings), and then execute the revised script.
For instance, using the script at the link above (saved in a local directory as "sendmail_base.py"):
and so on, replacing the header, recipient, etc., with the text strings you'd like to use, and the same for specification of the attachment file name.  Finally, you can save the output to a new Python file and execute it:
Although this is a very naive approach, it is simple and debugging of the script involves only examination of whether your output Python program is working and whether or not R is generating the right output Python program.  This is in contrast to debugging what's going on with R passing objects to and from various packages and languages.
