n should be incremented unconditionally. If it isn't the program gets stuck in an infinite loop the first time it encounters a non-prime.
def primegen():
    n = 1
    while True:
        if isprime(n):
            print n
            cont = raw_input("continue? Enter Y/N")
            if cont == 'N':
                break
        n += 1
