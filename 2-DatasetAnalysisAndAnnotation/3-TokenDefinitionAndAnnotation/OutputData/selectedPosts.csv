0,"I have created a user registration form in Django but every time I test it, the user is not being saved to the database because when the password is entered it raises ""this field can not be null. I do not understand why this is happening since the form was working before, and it follows the same procedures as other registration forms. I have been trying to figure out the cause of the issue for days and I am still not  understanding how the field can be null and still wont work.

2,"I am just very curious. Django runs the following line:
email_body = get_template(""applicant/email_with_token.txt"").render(Context())

it runs it from form_valid() of a class-based view. New context is created based on a regular python dictionary. No parameters are passed, that come from a view, user, session, etc... Inside of the template there is {% load i18n %} and a bunch of context/variables.
Still, Django recognizes the language of the current session and applies appropriate translations.
So, where from does it know the session language?

No the Python code and Java code do all the work in house so to speak.  I just generate 4 arrays with 350,000 random values each, then take the average.  I don't include the generation in the timings, only the averaging step.  The java threads timing uses 4 threads (one per array average), overkill but it's definitely the fastest.
The sqlite3 timing is driven by the Python program and is running from disk (not :memory:)
I realize Postgres is doing much more behind the scenes, but most of that work doesn't matter to me since this is read only data.
The Postgres query doesn't change timing on subsequent runs.
I've rerun the Python tests to include spooling it off the disk.  The timing slows down considerably to nearly 4 secs.  But I'm guessing that Python's file handling code is pretty much in C (though maybe not the csv lib?) so this indicates to me that Postgres isn't streaming from the disk either (or that you are correct and I should bow down before whoever wrote their storage layer!)

31,"Although the PDF specification is available from Adobe, it's not exactly the simplest document to read through.  PDF allows documents to be encrypted so that either a user password and/or an owner password is required to do various things with the document (display, print, etc).

I'm trying to parse PDFs that are locked in this way (to get the same privileges as you would get opening them in any reader).  Using an empty string as the user password doesn't work, but it seems (section 3.5.2 of the spec) that there has to be a user password to create the hash for the admin password.

38,"Historically it's been a lot of different schemes, especially before reducing power consumption in idle was an issue.
Generally there is an ""idle"" process/task that runs at the lowest priority and hence always gets control when there's nothing else to do.  Many older systems would simply have this process run a ""do forever"" loop with nothing of consequence in the loop body.  One OS I heard of would run machine diagnostics in the idle process.  A number of early PCs would run a memory refresh routine (since memory needed to be cycled regularly or it would ""evaporate"").
(A benefit of this scheme is that 100% minus the % CPU used by the idle process gives you the % CPU utilization -- a feature that was appreciated by OS designers.)
But the norm on most modern systems is to either run a ""halt"" or ""wait"" instruction or have a special flag in the process control block that even more directly tells the processor to simply stop running and go into power-saving mode.

As you can see, the code is very long and repetitive, even the shortened form. Running it on my laptop takes almost a minute (and my laptop is new). I have searched for answers, but I only found ways to generate random numbers. I tried using itertools.permutations as well, but that only shows the permutations, not creating a number. 
Generating all ten digits takes too long, and I want to know if there is a faster, simpler way, with an explanation, using python 3..

60,"I am working with .h5 files with little experience.
In a script I wrote I load in data from an .h5 file. The shape of the resulting array is: [3584, 3584, 75]. Here the values 3584 denotes the number of pixels, and 75 denotes the number of time frames. Loading the data and printing the shape takes 180 ms. I obtain this time using os.times().
If I now want to look at the data at a specific time frame I use the following piece of code:
data_1 = data[:, :, 1]

The slicing takes up a lot of time (1.76 s). I understand that my 2D array is huge but at some point I would like to loop over time which will take very long as I'm performing this slice within the for loop.
Is there a more effective/less time consuming way of slicing the time frames or handling this type of data?

80,"When Python executes a script file, the whole file is parsed first. You can notice that when you introduce a syntax error somewhere: Regardless of where it is, it will prevent any line from executing.
So since Python parses the file first, literals can be loaded effectively into the memory. Since Python knows that these are constant, all variables that represent those constant values can point to the same object in memory. So the object is shared.
This works for ints and floats, but even for strings; even when there is a constant expression that needs to be evaluated first:
a = ""foo""
b = ""foo""
c = ""fo"" + ""o""
print(a is b)
print(a is c)

Now in IDLE, the behavior is very different: As an interactive interpreter, IDLE executes every line separately. So a = 1.1 and b = 1.1 are executed in separated contexts which makes it impossible (or just very hard) to figure out that they both share the same constant literal value and could share the memory. So instead, the interpreter will allocate two different objects, which causes the identity check using is to fail.
For small integers, the situation is a bit different. Because they are often used, CPython stores a set of integers (in the range between -5 and 256) statically and makes that every value of these points to the same int object. That’s why you get a different result for small integers than for any other object. See also the following questions:

Does the Postgres query run faster a second time once it has had a chance to cache the data?  To be a little fairer your test for Java and Python should cover the cost of acquiring the data in the first place (ideally loading it off disk).
If this performance level is a problem for your application in practice but you need a RDBMS for other reasons then you could look at memcached.  You would then have faster cached access to raw data and could do the calculations in code.

98,"The major problem with passing locals() (or globals()) to format (or %) is that often, format strings can come from untrusted sources, and you risk exposing variables you didn't want to. If you're just formatting a literal string, that isn't an issue, but if you ever may have untrusted format strings, you have to think very carefully about what you're doing—and it's easier to just not do it.
The more minor problem is that some of your code's readers won't understand locals, or the ** syntax, and will have a hard time figuring out what it does or why it works. This isn't much of an argument. In fact, you could even say that a lot of Python's design decisions come down to making sure this is almost never a good argument—the language is exactly big enough that it's reasonable to expect your readers to understand/learn anything pythonic you write. But it's still worth thinking about.
Then there's the style issue. Every few months, someone comes along suggesting that the language should make it easier to do this, and it starts an argument on the mailing lists. Some people definitely think that this feels ""implicit rather than explicit"". Others disagree. I think it's pretty well settled that magic locals here would not be pythonic… but if you have to explicitly pass locals(), maybe that's fine and maybe it isn't. Like most style arguments that haven't gathered a consensus, it's really up to you. (By the way, the format API ultimately came out of an argument like this, where the original suggestion was for more-perl-like string interpolation with an implicit locals.)
But ultimately, you have to consider what you're saving. Compare this:
filename = ""data/avatars/{player_name}.{ext}"".format(**locals())

to:
filename = ""data/avatars/{0}.{1}"".format(player_name, ext)

Your version isn't clearer, more explicit, easier to type, or even shorter. So, I'd say the risk of making it a little harder for novices to read, and annoying to some segment of the community (even if it's for bad reasons), isn't worth it if there's no benefit.
