9,"I need to classify some values between two classes.
I have about 30 values that I can use as a training set and each value has 10 different dimensions.
I am using libSVM (in Python) and it seems that it works quite well.
I am trying also to give an interpretation to the model computed by libSVM, because I think that some dimensions are more ""important"" than others in the classification process.
For instance, consider the following example:
y, x = [1,1,1,-1,-1,-1],[[1,-1],[1,0],[1,1],[-1,-1],[-1,0],[-1,1]]
prob  = svm_problem(y, x)
param = svm_parameter()
param.kernel_type = LINEAR
param.C = 10
m = svm_train(prob, param)
svm_save_model('model_file', m)

is there any systematic way to detect these kind of situations analyzing the model generated by libSVM?

In [23]: np.argsort(A, axis=None)

# If you wish to add an auth token for more downloads, simply
# comment the following line and replace MY_AUTH_TOKEN with
# your auth token in the line below
params = ""?auth_token=YOUR_TOKEN""
params += ""&order=asc""

# Download the data from Quandl
data = requests.get(full_url).text
# Store the data to disk
fc = open('%s/%s.csv' % (dl_dir, contract), 'w')
fc.write(data)

Note:
The way you are using the api, by simple http request, altough works, is the not the ideal way to use their API.
There is a python package called Quandl, you can install like so:
pip3 install quandl

On your system.
Also then you would have a single (and not multiple using auth_token=YOUR_TOKEN in each request) auth call like so:
quandl.ApiConfig.api_key = 'YOUR_TOEKN'

And then each api call will be simple and elegent using their package instead or creating an http request manually, like so:
data = quandl.get(""CME/ESH2010.csv"", order=""asc"")

I will advise using the second method of using the API, but both will work perfectly.

21,"As pointed out by 0MQ founder Pieter Hintjens in this answer, the PUSH-PULL mechanism is not a load balancer, but rather a simple round robin distributor. That's a typo in the docs that is still there.
That said, for the load balancing pattern you need to add a broker in the middle of your architecture. As pointed out by Jason in the comments, this is well explained in the official guide. There are also examples in Python.

The main idea is to have the workers sending a small ""READY"" message to the broker whenever they are free to receive more jobs. The broker in turns, keep ""pointers"" to free workers in a queue. When he receives a new job request from a client he also propagates the request to the first free worker in the queue, which gets popped out from the queue. As you can see in the picture above, the broker exploits ROUTER sockets in order to avoid a blocking behavior and to get proper load balancing. A small additional detail is that the broker does not poll the clients if there are not free workers in the queue.
This is the simplest way I am aware of for implementing a load balancing pattern with ZeroMQ. It is not exactly like ""polling"" for new jobs in the queue, but I think this is what you need. Also please beware that this is really the simplest way, that is, it is not reliable at all and it does not scale well as is. If you also need reliability, I suggest you to thoroughly read Chapter 4 of the official guide.
As a side note, maybe you should seriously consider Celery for this task. I am really in love with ZeroMQ, however this is exactly the kind of thing that Celery is very good at, and in my opinion it is not so difficult to learn, as someone may think.

    """"""Documentation for a function.

    More details.
    """"""
    pass

In which case the comments will be extracted by doxygen, but you won't be able to use any of the special doxygen commands.
Or you can (similar to C-style languages under doxygen) double up the comment marker (#) on the first line before the member:
## @package pyexample
#  Documentation for this module.
#
#  More details.

## Documentation for a function.
#
#  More details.
def func():
    pass

In that case, you can use the special doxygen commands. There's no particular Python output mode, but you can apparently improve the results by setting OPTMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA to YES.
Honestly, I'm a little surprised at the difference - it seems like once doxygen can detect the comments in ## blocks or """""" blocks, most of the work would be done and you'd be able to use the special commands in either case. Maybe they expect people using """""" to adhere to more Pythonic documentation practices and that would interfere with the special doxygen commands?

Caveats

I use <=, not < as indicated in your question, because that's what numpy supports.
This minimizes the total sum of all values in the target vector.
For your use case, you probably want to minimize the distance
to the original sample, which the linear program cannot handle, since neither the squared error nor the absolute difference can be expressed using a linear combination (which is what c stands for). For that, you will probably need to go to full minimize(). 

Still, this should get you rough idea.

30,"Assignment itself does nothing. rc here is your client. Doing rc[0], or any sort of indexing, generates and returns a DirectView object that's a view with whatever engines you specify in []. This is a shorthand for generating the views: it's not actually just getting a specific object.
Thus, those views aren't unique. The best way to explain it, I think, is with an example. Say you have 2 engines. You want to run some tasks on only engine one, and want the tasks to block. You want to run others on only engine one, but don't want them to block. You want to run yet more on engines 1 and 2, and don't want them to block. Then you could do:
view_1_block = rc[0]
view_1_block.block = True
view_2_noblock = rc[0]
view_2_noblock.block = False
view_3_noblock = rc[[0,1]]
view_3_noblock.block = False

Then, you can use these to run tasks in whatever way you'd like, eg
view_1_block.map(lambda x:x**10, range(32)) # blocks, returns results, runs only on 1
view_3_noblock.map(lambda x:x**10, range(32)) # does not block, returns AsyncResult, runs on 1 and 2

There's no actual magic being used here. When you run rc[0] twice, it generates two views. The second view is not the same as the first. When you assign rc[0] to a variable, and then use that variable, you're working with one view, and not creating a new one. 
iPython, like Numpy and Scipy, has quite a few shorthand notations that don't necessarily fit Python's idioms perfectly. This is especially the case with [] and getitem. A purer Python way of writing this could would be to use the much more unwieldy rc.direct_view(1), and so on, which would make clear that this wasn't just getting an item, and was actually creating a view.

Subtracting multi-sets removes characters when their count falls to 0. If this results in an empty multi-set, it becomes False in a boolean context, like all 'empty' python types. not turns that into True if that is the case.

The intent if to have scripts/foo/ and scripts/bar/ be directories of runnable python scripts that make use of the modules in lib1, lib2, lib3. Scripts, lib1, lib2, and lib3 are all separate internal git repositories under active development. There isn't a static interface or published version to depend on. Basically, they are all being written nearly at the same time by a small team.
I've played with making lib[1-3] submodules and I really hate the workflow. What I think I would like is to be able to do ""import lib1"" from foo/a.py and have it use the current code in lib1. Once things mature we will likely version everything and work to product proper packages. 
One way to do this would to muck with sys.path in each of the scripts to explicitly look in '../../' or something. I was wondering if there was something more elegant. Could I get something like pip install -r requirements.txt to do this work for me? I don't want to make an official pypi setup.py, I just want to get a pointer to the current contents of the lib[1-3] directory. The reason I like the requirements.txt approach is that as the libs mature, I'll end up putting version and git URLs in there.

61,"This answer is specific to Windows NT-based OS.
Idle thread functioality
Tasks may vary between architectures, but generally these are the tasks performed by idle threads:

Enable interrupts to allow pending interrupts be delivered
Disable interrupts (using STI or CLI instructions, more on wiki)
On the DEBUG (or checked) builds, query if a kernel debugger is attached and allow breakpoints if been requested
Handle deferred procedure calls
Check if there are any runnable threads ready for execution. If there is one, update the idle processor control block with a pointer to the thread
Check the queues of other processors, if possible schedule thread awaiting execution on the idle processor
Call a power management routine, which may halt a processor or downgrade CPU tick rate and do other similar power saving activities

Additional info
When there are no runnable threads for a logical processor, Windows executes a kernel-mode idle thread. There is only 1 Idle process that has as many idle threads as there are logical processors. So on a Quad core machine with 4 logical/physical processors, there will be 1 Idle process and 4 idle threads.
In Windows, Idle process has ID = 0, so do all the Idle threads. These objects are represented by standard EPROCESS/KPROCESS and ETHREAD/KTHREAD data structures. But they are not executive manager processes and threads objects. There are no user-land address space and no user-land code is executed..
Idle process is statically allocated at system boot time before the process manager and object manager are set up. Idle thread structures are allocated dynamically as logical processors are brought live.
Idle thread priority is set to 0. However, this value doesn't actually matter as this thread only gets executed when there are no other threads available to run. Idle thread priority is never compared with priority of any other threads.
Idle threads are also special cases for preemption. The idle thread main routine KiIdleLoop (implementation from reactos) performs several tasks that are not interrupted by other threads. When there are no runnable threads available to run on a processor, that processor is marked as idle in a processor control block. Then if a runnable threads arrives to the queue scheduled for execution, that thread's address pointer is stored in the NextThread pointer of the idle processor control block. During the run of an idle thread, this pointer address gets checked on every iteration inside a while loop.

69,"The zip commands in that tutorial are missing a parameter. I ran into this exact problem today with pysftp, which is built on paramiko. libffi-72499c49.so.6.0.4 is in a hidden dot directory inside lib64/python2.7/site-packages/.libs_cffi_backend. Depending on how you zipped up the dependencies in your virtualenv, you may have inadvertantly excluded this directory.

First, make sure libffi-devel and openssl-devel are installed on your Amazon Linux instance, otherwise the cryptography module may not be compiling correctly.
sudo yum install libffi-devel openssl-devel


If those packages were not installed before, delete and rebuild your virtualenv.

Make sure that when you are zipping up your site-packages that you use '.' instead of '*', otherwise you will not be including files and directories that are hidden because their names begin with a period.

82,"Im trying to call a python file containing a sentence/word tokenizer from my php file like this:
$output = shell_exec('python tokenizer.py $sentence')

I've tried single exec, full paths to python and tokenizer.py, wrapping $sentence in double quotes. But logically, It should not be the problem because calling print(1) at the beginning of python the python code before actually using any nltk packages makes $output equal to '1'. So I came to conclusion that the problem here is the nltk itself, like the path to the modules is not correct or something...
But, calling python from the shell using the same command as above gives me fully tokenized output! To conclude: looks like when calling python from php magically 'turns off' nltk, while it fully works when executed from the shell.
Here's the part of the python code I am using:
import sys
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

sample_text2 = sys.argv[1]
gust = sent_tokenize(sample_text2)
#print(1) here doesn't work, but everywhere above (before calling sent_tokenize) it does.

The server's running on CentOS (Linux), I am accessing it via SSH.
Obvious question: What am I doing wrong here with PHP? Or generally? Any alternatives?
EDIT
As visible in dvhh's answer and its comments, the situation happened because there were two versions installed on the server (2.6 and 2.7), while the www user had access to 2.6 and through console, the default version was 2.7. The solution was to change the default python to 2.7 for both cases and to put the nltk modules to one of the dependency folders. (Or append the dependency directory using sys.path.append)

87,"I was wondering if anyone here had some experience writing this type of script and if they could give me some pointers.
I would like to modify this script to validate that the check-in file does not have a Carriage Return in the EOL formatting. The EOL format is CR LF in Windows and LF in Unix. When a User checks-in code with the Windows format. It does not compile in Unix anymore. I know this can be done on the client side but I need to have this validation done on the server side. To achieve this, I need to do the following:
1) Make sure the file I check is not a binary, I dont know how to do this with svnlook, should I check the mime:type of the file? The Red Book does not indicate this clearly or I must have not seen it.
2) I would like to run the dos2unix command to validate that the file has the correct EOL format. I would compare the output of the dos2unix command against the original file. If there is a diff between both, I give an error message to the client and cancel the check-in.

for i in range(1,6):

However, this is inefficient because it will calculate the lower Fibonacci numbers more than once. You can use an array to store the intermediate Fibonacci numbers and improve performance:
def fibR(n):
    if n > len(fibR.values) - 1:
        for i in range(len(fibR.values), n+1):

The openpyxl documentation is pretty clear about the different options used when opening workbooks: data_only only read the results of any formulae and ignore the formulae.
See https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl/issue/171/copy-worksheet-function if you want to copy worksheets.
Otherwise you can use two workbooks, one in read-only mode and the other in write-only mode. But if you want to copy, this is best done in the file system.
If you only want to copy the values from one workbook to another then you can combine read-only and write-only modes to reduce the memory footprint. The following pseudo-code should give you a basis.
wb1 = load_workbook(""file.xlsx"", read_only=True, data_only=True)

92,"I think it certainly sounds like a viable option. As far as I know, the only ""interaction"" the official Python installer has with Windows is to add registry keys associating .py and .pyw files with the proper executables and possibly modifying the PATH variable. As long as the user has the correct .dll files to which the .exe's are linked, you could just zip up c:\Python33 or whichever version you're using and distribute that with your application. Before you do that, though, clone the directory and go through c:\clonedPython\libs\site-packages and get rid of any modules that aren't required for your application. Don't delete any necessary dependencies!
Portable Python is a possibility, but there may be some issues with certain modules not working properly, and it's not available yet for Python 3.3 (3.2.1 is the latest version, as well as 2.7.3), so if you have version-dependent syntax that might not be the best choice.
