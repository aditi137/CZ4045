6,"Using Django 1.7 and Celery on Heroku with Postgres and RabbitMQ.
I recently set the CONN_MAX_AGE setting in Django to 60 or so so I could start pooling database connections.

I would like to keep pooling database connections, but this has happened a few times now and I obviously can't allow Celery to randomly fail. How can I get Django (or Celery) to force a new database connection only when this error is hit?

Now everything is working fine, in one-file mode, with use of accepted answer's function to access resource files!
Edit 2: as shown in accepted answer's comments, problem is coming from path resolution in my script; I try to use __file__ to get the location of the script, so that I can access to its resource files. This does not work once packaged, as __file__ will return filename from Python.dll to the script, so quite always no path and just a file name. So I have to find another trick to make access to resource files; a work-around for the moment is to move current directory to the executable path.

30,"Postgres is doing a lot more than it looks like (maintaining data consistency for a start!)
If the values don't have to be 100% spot on, or if the table is updated rarely, but you are running this calculation often, you might want to look into Materialized Views to speed it up.
(Note, I have not used materialized views in Postgres, they look at little hacky, but might suite your situation).
Materialized Views
Also consider the overhead of actually connecting to the server and the round trip required to send the request to the server and back.
I'd consider 200ms for something like this to be pretty good, A quick test on my oracle server, the same table structure with about 500k rows and no indexes, takes about 1 - 1.5 seconds, which is almost all just oracle sucking the data off disk.
The real question is, is 200ms fast enough?
-------------- More --------------------
I was interested in solving this using materialized views, since I've never really played with them. This is in oracle.
First I created a MV which refreshes every minute.
While its refreshing, there is no rows returned
Once it refreshes, its MUCH faster than doing the raw query
If we insert into the base table, the result is not immediately viewable view the MV.
But wait a minute or so, and the MV will update behind the scenes, and the result is returned fast as you could want.
This isn't ideal. for a start, its not realtime, inserts/updates will not be immediately visible. Also, you've got a query running to update the MV whether you need it or not (this can be tune to whatever time frame, or on demand). But, this does show how much faster an MV can make it seem to the end user, if you can live with values which aren't quite upto the second accurate.

No, netTcpBinding is interoperable only with WCF clients. 
From here:
The default configuration for the NetTcpBinding is faster than the
  configuration provided by the WSHttpBinding, but it is intended only
  for WCF-to-WCF communication. 
From comments:
does wsHttpBinding work or only basicHttpBinding work?
Short answer is no, basicHttpBinding is the only binding (except for the web bindings) which support interoperability with non-wcf clients. Even then you may have difficulty consuming it from non-windows.
Long answer is that the reason this is the case is because basicHttpBinding supports communication over SOAP 1.1, which is a relatively simple protocol, and most vendors have implemented it in very similar ways. Therefore, these different implementations tend to be interoperable. However, wsHttpBinding is Microsoft's attempt to support the SOAP 1.2 protocol and WS-* web service extensions, which is a much larger and more complex set of standards. So there is a much larger scope for interpretation between the various vendors, leading normally to non-interoperability between implementations. It is theoretically possible, therefore, to call an endpoint exposed over wsHttpBinding from a non-wcf (or even non-windows) client, but you would have to overcome all the niggles.
A much better approach would be to move away from SOAP completely if possible, and just use HTTP/POX or HTTP/REST services.

64,"I've written a Python package that includes a bsddb database of pre-computed values for one of the more time-consuming computations.  For simplicity, my setup script installs the database file in the same directory as the code which accesses the database (on Unix, something like /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/mypackage/).
How do I store the final location of the database file so my code can access it?  Right now, I'm using a hack based on the __file__ variable in the module which accesses the database:
dbname = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), ""database.dat"")
It works, but it seems... hackish.  Is there a better way to do this?  I'd like to have the setup script just grab the final installation location from the distutils module and stuff it into a ""dbconfig.py"" file that gets installed alongside the code that accesses the database.

73,"The growing complexity of this answer over time, and the many hacks required, probably ought to caution you against doing this at all. It's relying on undocumented internal implementation details of the admin, is likely to break again in future versions of Django, and is no easier to implement than just finding another JS calendar widget and using that.
That said, here's what you have to do if you're determined to make this work:
Define your own ModelForm subclass for your model (best to put it in forms.py in your app), and tell it to use the AdminDateWidget / AdminTimeWidget / AdminSplitDateTime (replace 'mydate' etc with the proper field names from your model):
Change your URLconf to pass 'form_class': ProductForm instead of 'model': Product to the generic create_object view (that'll mean ""from my_app.forms import ProductForm"" instead of ""from my_app.models import Product"", of course).
In the head of your template, include {{ form.media }} to output the links to the Javascript files.
And the hacky part: the admin date/time widgets presume that the i18n JS stuff has been loaded, and also require core.js, but don't provide either one automatically.  So in your template above {{ form.media }} you'll need:
You may also wish to use the following admin CSS (thanks Alex for mentioning this):
This implies that Django's admin media (ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX) is at /media/admin/ - you can change that for your setup.  Ideally you'd use a context processor to pass this values to your template instead of hardcoding it, but that's beyond the scope of this question.
This also requires that the URL /my_admin/jsi18n/ be manually wired up to the django.views.i18n.javascript_catalog view (or null_javascript_catalog if you aren't using I18N).  You have to do this yourself instead of going through the admin application so it's accessible regardless of whether you're logged into the admin (thanks Jeremy for pointing this out).  Sample code for your URLconf:
Lastly, if you are using Django 1.2 or later, you need some additional code in your template to help the widgets find their media:

90,"As pointed out by 0MQ founder Pieter Hintjens in this answer, the PUSH-PULL mechanism is not a load balancer, but rather a simple round robin distributor. That's a typo in the docs that is still there.
That said, for the load balancing pattern you need to add a broker in the middle of your architecture. As pointed out by Jason in the comments, this is well explained in the official guide. There are also examples in Python.
The main idea is to have the workers sending a small ""READY"" message to the broker whenever they are free to receive more jobs. The broker in turns, keep ""pointers"" to free workers in a queue. When he receives a new job request from a client he also propagates the request to the first free worker in the queue, which gets popped out from the queue. As you can see in the picture above, the broker exploits ROUTER sockets in order to avoid a blocking behavior and to get proper load balancing. A small additional detail is that the broker does not poll the clients if there are not free workers in the queue.
This is the simplest way I am aware of for implementing a load balancing pattern with ZeroMQ. It is not exactly like ""polling"" for new jobs in the queue, but I think this is what you need. Also please beware that this is really the simplest way, that is, it is not reliable at all and it does not scale well as is. If you also need reliability, I suggest you to thoroughly read Chapter 4 of the official guide.
As a side note, maybe you should seriously consider Celery for this task. I am really in love with ZeroMQ, however this is exactly the kind of thing that Celery is very good at, and in my opinion it is not so difficult to learn, as someone may think.
